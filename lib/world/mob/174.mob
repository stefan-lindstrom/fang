Reul the black marketer~
A cringing man by the name of Reul stands here.
~
A small man that almost seems to cringe everytime you
look at him, Reul is a seller of black market
goods here in the Whitecloak controlled areas.
It is rumoured that he even has the unoffical backing
of the High Inquisitor himself but such claims
have always been denied.
