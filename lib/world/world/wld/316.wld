of thick tree timbers lashed together, there doesn't appear to be any
obvious way to circumvent the walls.  Ironically, for all the
impregnability of the walls, the front gate of the fort is wide open.
Indeed, there doesn't even seem to be any sort of mechanism to close the
gate, short of actively defending it.

of thick tree timbers lashed together, there doesn't appear to be any
obvious way to circumvent the walls.  Ironically, for all the
impregnability of the walls, the front gate of the fort is wide open.
Indeed, there doesn't even seem to be any sort of mechanism to close the
gate, short of actively defending it.

corners which support the red, white and blue ropes that hang tautly between
them.

the village being composed of maybe ten houses with an opening

houses is serving as an inn as well except being home for one 
of the families. In the warm summer day the only protection 
from the heat can be found in the houses, or off in the forest. 
A seldom used road goes through the village, from the east to

and one away, and the paths are seperated by a line of tall &amp;gt&amp;Gr&amp;We&amp;Ge&amp;gs&amp;n which
might be the kind to flower in spring.  Such trees surround the area, in

while giving the western side of the road a heavier shadow of &amp;Kfo&amp;gr&amp;Ge&amp;Kst&amp;n.  
The two directions meet in a curve before the manor, not far from what
looks to be the front door, and there is a side path leading to the barn
as well.  The house itself is a large two-story building, boasting of
large windows in it's &amp;Kstone&amp;n face, it's natural &amp;Kgr&amp;we&amp;Ky c&amp;wo&amp;Klor&amp;wi&amp;Kng&amp;n and &amp;kdark&amp;n roof

      <roomdescription>The path up to this sturdy barn leads into wide double doors, which open
by sliding apart in the center, and are of sufficient length to easily
allow the passage of a carriage, or perhaps two riders, side by side.  
The outside of the building is a bright, freshly painted &amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;n with a pale
roof and an abundance of small windows.  Inside, there are four stalls,
all of which are in current or recent use, and there are signs of a
well-ordered stableman in residence.  Grooming tools are all arranged
neatly on one wall, bridles and bits and various riding accoutrements on
another.  The floor is clean-swept, everything &amp;Kmetal&amp;n has at least a dull
gleam to it, and everything &amp;yw&amp;Yo&amp;ro&amp;Rd&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;n looks to have been polished not long
ago.  There is a loft as well, bearing fresh-smelling &amp;yhay&amp;n, and a small
ladder lays nestled into a corner for access.  On the wall opposite the
entrance, another door leads out into the &amp;gf&amp;Gi&amp;we&amp;Gl&amp;gd&amp;n, a spacious meadow and
occasional tree, part of which is fenced in for the horses to graze.

country-style, &amp;Ww&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wd&amp;Wo&amp;ww&amp;We&amp;wd&amp;n door that leads into a welcoming, open space.  
Serving as kitchen, with a hearth and &amp;Kstove&amp;n and storage cabinets, it also
has a large table for eating and a long counter that divides the two
regions, making the place a dining room as well.  The stove is
wood-burning, set into the east wall, sharing a chimney with the &amp;rf&amp;Ri&amp;Yr&amp;ye&amp;rp&amp;Rl&amp;Ya&amp;yc&amp;re&amp;n
that is beside it.  Large &amp;Ww&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wd&amp;Wo&amp;ww&amp;Ws&amp;n look out on the orchard, bringing
natural light into the room, though there are niches in the walls for
holding lamps when necessary.  The west door beckons to the orchard, and
this seems to be the central room of the house, for there are in fact
doors on all four walls.  To the east, the living room, and to the south,
an entrance onto the L-shaped porch.

      <roomdescription>The heat of southern Altara lends aid to the growth of fruit trees, and
concentric circles of them have been planted here, too few to produce a
large crop but enough to supply the villa.  &amp;yOr&amp;ra&amp;yng&amp;re&amp;ys, &amp;ga&amp;rp&amp;Rp&amp;gl&amp;re&amp;Rs&amp;n, and &amp;gpe&amp;Ga&amp;grs&amp;n
among them, the trees are large and old, looking well cared for, and they
give &amp;Kshade&amp;n to the western side of the house.  A path leads approximately
into the middle of the grove, where there is a small clearing and a bench
placed, and the roof of a modest one-story building can be detected to the
southwest, likely the servant quarters.  To the north is the barn's
&amp;gm&amp;Ge&amp;wa&amp;Wd&amp;Go&amp;gw&amp;n, and occasionally the horses must wander over, for every so often
one can catch sight of an apple on the ground with a large bite taken out
of it.  There is also the random &amp;rap&amp;yr&amp;ric&amp;yo&amp;rt&amp;n and &amp;yp&amp;Ye&amp;ra&amp;Yc&amp;yh&amp;n tree, though these are
scarce, if healthy and well-bearing.

no doubt occupying the same chimney as the kitchen, and it's elegantly
rustic construction is impressive.  It seems to be made from large,
smooth, water-worn &amp;Krocks&amp;n, maybe foraged from a riverbed or quarry.  There
is a door on the same wall, leading into the kitchen, and bookshelves line
the other walls where there are not doors.  There is a small &amp;cg&amp;gl&amp;wo&amp;gb&amp;ce&amp;n-like
structure in one corner, and a chair beside it, as well as large rolled-up
&amp;ws&amp;yc&amp;Kr&amp;Wo&amp;Kl&amp;yl&amp;ws&amp;n on a nearby bookshelf that probably indicate the presence of maps.
A couch occupies the southeast corner of the room, beside the eastern door
to the porch, and it is covered in large blanket-like &amp;yf&amp;Ku&amp;yr&amp;Ks&amp;n which
compliment a similar skin rug on the wooden floor.  In all, this is a room
of intelligent and classic beauty, with it's shelves and armoires
containing untold measures of knowledge and wisdom.  A staircase rests
along the northern wall, leading to an upper level.

soaring ceilings are reminiscent of an attic, but it is decorated and
furnished as a master bedroom.  A large bed lies in the middle of the
room, it's four posts carved from &amp;yp&amp;wa&amp;Wl&amp;ye&amp;n, &amp;yo&amp;ra&amp;Kk&amp;re&amp;yn&amp;n woods which support a
compliment of &amp;ba&amp;Bz&amp;cu&amp;Br&amp;be&amp;n-hued silk draperies.  Curtains of a deeper &amp;bb&amp;Bl&amp;bue&amp;n flank
the &amp;Ww&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wd&amp;Wo&amp;ww&amp;Ws&amp;n, matching a similar tone in the furniture and carpets that are
throughout the room.  Between the &amp;Ww&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wd&amp;Wo&amp;ww&amp;Ws&amp;n, in the spaces where there is
wall to rest against, are placed a small book- case, an armoire, and a
wardrobe, all cut from the same color as the &amp;yf&amp;rr&amp;Ka&amp;rm&amp;ye&amp;n of the bed.  Where the
chimney cuts into one of the walls, there is a &amp;rf&amp;Ri&amp;Yr&amp;ye&amp;rp&amp;Rl&amp;Ya&amp;yc&amp;re&amp;n and a door beside
it, leading out onto a small balcony.  The view, however, is lovely from
every window, the vantage affording sight of the grounds as well as the
beach, and the &amp;Bw&amp;ca&amp;wt&amp;ce&amp;Br&amp;n beyond.

through the &amp;ydunes&amp;n.  The porch itself is littered with windows, both to the
inside and out, so that the &amp;Wl&amp;Yi&amp;yg&amp;wh&amp;Wt&amp;n might be shared as extensively as is
possible.  There are a few small bookshelves, a chair or two, and a &amp;yw&amp;ro&amp;Ro&amp;yd&amp;re&amp;Rn&amp;n
swing that is anchored into the ceiling, giving one, or two perhaps, a
relaxing view of the &amp;co&amp;Bc&amp;be&amp;Ba&amp;cn&amp;n.  Breezes blow freely through the passage when
the windows are open, and sparse &amp;Wl&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;we&amp;Wn&amp;n curtains wave slightly as they are

&amp;cp&amp;Bo&amp;bn&amp;cd&amp;n.  In fact, it is a stone-lined pit dug into the earth, deep enough to
allow natural &amp;Bw&amp;ba&amp;Kt&amp;be&amp;Br&amp;n to fill it halfway.  Rough- hewn steps are carved into
the walls, leading to a flattened bathing area, sufficient to allow use by
two or three, but likely no more than that.  There are small &amp;rf&amp;yl&amp;go&amp;cw&amp;Be&amp;br&amp;ms&amp;n
planted about, and a square wooden chest against the wall of the house.  
To the west is a door to the porch, and that appears to be the only
immediate access to the baths, as the north and south are untamed wilds of
&amp;gf&amp;yo&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;ys&amp;Kt&amp;n and &amp;ysa&amp;Yn&amp;wd d&amp;Yu&amp;ynes&amp;n, respectively.  Generally secluded from prying eyes,
this place gives off a relaxing aura and no doubt the still &amp;Kw&amp;ca&amp;Bt&amp;be&amp;cr&amp;Ks&amp;n are
much cooler than the heat of the sun.

path of flat &amp;ks&amp;Kh&amp;wa&amp;Kl&amp;ke&amp;n stones, set into the earth around the natural rises and
falls of of the sands around.  The vegetation is a little more sparse
here, consisting mainly of tall &amp;ggr&amp;Ga&amp;ws&amp;Gs&amp;ges&amp;n and the occasional small tree, but
there is one which provides shade to a small bench, about halfway between
the &amp;co&amp;Bc&amp;be&amp;Ba&amp;cn&amp;n and the house.  Wind-swept grains of sand litter the walkway, in
places, but the ground has been hard packed by use and maintanence,
prevening the shifting of the dunes to overtake the path.  Without care,
it would surely disappear, for this area has been left mainly to grow as
it wishes, untended and &amp;gw&amp;yi&amp;Kl&amp;gd&amp;n.

      <roomdescription>Without doubt or guess-work, this place must surely be the reason for the
placement of the villa, for the vast &amp;ys&amp;Ya&amp;wn&amp;Yd&amp;ys&amp;n and roaring &amp;bw&amp;Ba&amp;cv&amp;Be&amp;bs&amp;n overtake the
senses completely.  As the dunes flatten and break into beach, the sun's
rays beat down un- obstructed, heightening the heat and baking the pale
&amp;ys&amp;Ya&amp;wn&amp;yd&amp;n.  There are small signs of life, the occasional shell and tuft of sea
&amp;gg&amp;cr&amp;Ka&amp;cs&amp;gs&amp;n, but for the most part, the &amp;yb&amp;Ke&amp;wa&amp;Kc&amp;yh&amp;n is smooth and clear of debris that
might make walking barefoot trecherous.  The ocean &amp;bw&amp;Ba&amp;ct&amp;be&amp;Br&amp;cs&amp;n wash up on the
shore relentlessly, at times crystalline blue and at others slate grey,
always murmuring their mysteries to any who would listen.  In the
distance, birds can be heard calling to one another, and sometimes the
&amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;n silhoette of a gull can be seen diving down into the &amp;bw&amp;Ba&amp;cv&amp;Be&amp;bs&amp;n to
retrieve a fish.  The peacefulness can not be denied, and indeed the raw
beauty almost commands relaxation upon the shores.

      <description>&amp;cWelcome to Silvershard mercenaries. We are here to provide you with IC fighters to protect you when you feel that your current RP requires it. What you have to do to get our services is simply to write a mudmail to the current mercenary commander. The mudmail, is IC and should tell us why you what kind of IC job you want. Once you have done so, the commander will get back to you, ICly to set the details and play out the RP.

If you want to become a mercenary captain yourself, send a mudmail to the current mercenary commander explaining the parts of your background that are important for the position (I.E. previous training and experience and that kind of stuff. Knowing whom your lover is or if your parents were killed by whitecloaks is not important for the job.) Also include the reason why you want to join our agency ICly. Simply put, an IC job application.

The current &amp;YM&amp;yercenary &amp;YC&amp;yommander&amp;c is:

      <roomdescription>The starcase leading up to this large bedroom is rickety but does the job
it was intended to do.  The room has a few large windows that face the
street, but the curtains have been drawn.  The floor is covered with nice
thick tairen carpets and the walls are decorated with well-kept weapons
and a few oil lamps.  It is obviously a bedroom, as a big bed is the most
obvious piece of furniture.  Along one of the walls, there is a large
cabinet made of oak for storing clothes and other possessions.  A nice
smell covers the room, emanating from a tiny incense-holder that is placed
on a small table next to the bed.  However, the without the incense, the
room would probably have a completely different fragrance.  Placed on the
same table, there are several empty bottles of wine and a few pieces of
bread that has started to shift color.

      <roomdescription>This large room is where Mercenary Captains that doesnt have a house of
their own live when they are not out on an assignment.  The room is cozy
and the floor is neatly covered with intricately decorated carpets.  The
wooden paneled walls are covered with various decorations put up by the
individual captains.  There are several comfortable beds along the sides
of the room and each mercenarys personal belongings are neatly stored in
shelves and chests near their own bed.  The room has been divided in the
middle by a makeshift barrier made of a large piece of linen cloth.  This
allows the female and male captains to share the same room without making
the other sex feel uncomfortable.

      <roomdescription>This calm room is excellently lighted.  Apart from the windows, there are
several lit brass candle-stands that ensure that the room is bright enough
to work in.  The big brick fireplace is also giving off light, as well as
warmth.  The fireplace, together with the beautiful carpets gives a homely
air to the room.  There are some high-backed chairs in front of the
fireplace for conversations, and a large desk covered with miscellaneous
documents is placed along the wall.  The chairs are centered on a small
table where a small keg with a tap is placed together with some mugs.  
The door leading back to the shop is to the east but there is also a
sturdy-looking door banded with steel to the south and a small staircase
along the back wall leading up.

      <roomdescription>A foul odour covers this cramped, low-celinged room.  The center part of
the room has been cleared of everything.  Hanging from the roof is a tiny
oil lamp that barely lights the chamber.  A layer of cork has been nailed
to the walls and the roof and this causes all talk to be soaked up by the
walls.  As if that was not enough, massive shelves packed with clothes and
other textile line all of the walls.  All of this ensures that the room is
almost completely soundproof and impossible to eavesdrop.  A large table
filled with knives, sharpened hooks, vials with unknown content and
several other nasty things is placed in front of one of the shelves along
with a chair equipped with cords to tie a person to it.  As if that was
not enough, a massive iron chest, as large as a man, is in one of the
corners and one can only imagine what it is used for.

      <roomdescription>You are standing in a dirty-looking wooden fort.  From the walls hang torn
and tattered red banners, flapping weakly in the wind coming from over the
fort's forbidding walls.  The ground consists of a heavily-trodden squishy,
wet mud and clay mixture.

To the north is a narrow passage that seems to lead deeper into the fort.

    <roombasic title="The Path Toward Andor" vnum="31796" zone="316">
      <roomdescription>   This is a winding path heading toward Andor, which lies to the south.  The
path is quite overgrown with weeds but is passable on horseback, carriage or
cart.  Deep ruts lie here and there along the way making it rather dangerous at
times especially for carts and carriages.  Great shade trees overlie the path
as it wanders westwardly and continues even as the path turns south.  A number
of fences skirt along the path at varying intervals, some made of wood and
others made of stone.  There are several farms but they lie at good distances
apart and many of them are abandoned.

    <roombasic title="The Stable" vnum="31797" zone="316">
      <roomdescription>   This stable is currently being rebuilt.  The smell of freshly cut timber is
strong enough to be noticed even above the odour of the half dozen or so horses
that are currently in their new stalls.  Other stalls are still unfinished,
some not yet having a door others yet missing a wall.  The door on one end of
the stable leads to the Main hall, the only other exit takes you to a path that
leads away from the manor, towards Andor.

    <roombasic title="The Main Hall of the Manor" vnum="31798" zone="316">
      <roomdescription>   Even after a hasty clean up in this huge room, signs of neglect remain.  
Dust still hangs thick on any surface that was too high to reach in a hurry.  
This room might remind you of the surrounding grounds in one way, the room is a
square, set out in perfect symmetry.  On both sides of the room, large oaken
stairways lead up to the next floor.  Two large marble fireplaces are spaced at
equal distance along each side wall.  There are two large windows on each of
the four walls, all identical in height and width, all in dark mahogany.  Even
the furniture has been placed so that everything looks even.  A long oaken
table is neatly positioned near each corner of the room, a dozen chairs to each
table.

    <roombasic title="Path Approaching an Old Manor" vnum="31799" zone="316">
      <roomdescription>   The path begins just outside the low and crumbling outter wall of the manor,
rising at a very shallow slope, perfectly straight on it's way from the main
gates to the main entrance.  There is a rather large garden on either side of
the path, with trees and shrubs laid out to make the gardens almost perfect
mirror images of each other.  Both are now overgrown, and weeds sprout through
the grass like a plague.  The path itself has more than a few cracks along it,
adding to the disheveled appearance of the manor grounds.  One area of the
garden on the right has been cleared and now bears a rather large wooden table,
with benches along both sides of it and a high chair at each end.  As you near
the manor itself, you become aware that it is not only the grounds that have
been left in disrepair, but the main building has too.  Flaking paint and a few
broken windows show that the manor went without occupants for some time
recently, but repairs and redecorating have already begun.  A smell of fresh
paint permeates the air.
