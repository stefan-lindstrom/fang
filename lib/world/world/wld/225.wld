     The room is empty for the most part. Maps and the things for
     building are scattered all over the area, none too neatly. 
     Mortar and wood are stacked neatly though, off to the side,
     as well as paints and gold gilding and iron, and.. well, and
     anything else that is needed for building great cities!

     Take a look at the maps that should be laying on the floor
     to see stage one of the great building project of Maradon,
     The Palace.

      <roomdescription>The road is very wide and clean, the smooth white stone it is made of appears
to be almost seamless. Leading into a large, yet busy intersection, the South
road intersects Palace street here. Palace street heads in an eastern and 
western direction. Sounds of commerce are loud in the air, as well as a few 
harsh barks of orders from a passing officer of the city guards. Towards the 
north a very large wall is prominant, it&apos;s a pure white and also appears to be
seamless, being made out of huge stone slabs.

      <description>The wall is huge, it looks very impenetrable. It also looks as if it has
withstood several attacks as it is. The white stone wall looks seamless,
the huge slabs of stone it is made out of fitting almost perfectly into

      <roomdescription>Leading north and south, the road moves directly next to the imposing wall that
surrounds the palace. A large iron gate that is gilded beautifully blocks the
road to the north, although impressive looking carriages and nobles on fine
horses can be seen entering and leaving. The sounds of men issuing orders and
jingling of harnesses can be heard from the north as well.

wall towards the Palace. There is a small iron door to the west, leading 
directly into the white wall that surrounds the Palace. Several pikes rest 
beside the door and raucous men&apos;s voices can be heard from inside. A path
leads to the north past the large gate, towards a beautiful Palace. South leads
directly to the South road and back into the city.

A clear path leads towards theg Palace steps in a large half circle, starting 
towards the west, then leading towards the east where coaches and horses seem 
to be led. The Palace itself to the north is magnificent, an extravagant piece 
of architecture that seems unparalled anywhere in the world. Directly to the 
east, a large circular area can be seen, apparently for exercising horses, but 
a very large fence surrounds it, making the only clear route north or south.

the east. The steps are pure white and flawless, a dozen men wide, with a
red carpet leading down the middle of it. Towards the top of the stairs a set
of looming double doors lead into the absolutely stunning Palace. The doors
themselves are incredibly impressive, they are made of the finest wood and
appear to be gilded in a fine, extravagant gold. The smell of horses drift
from the east, while a large structure, apparently barracks for soldiers
lies to the west.

and almost any other weapon you can imagine. A small fountain rests to the

as south, the entrance resting directly to the west has a solid looking door,

it for those who wish to watch practice spars of hand to hand combat between

everything here seems to be precise. The floor, although scuffed, shines

rare for soldier&apos;s quarters. The large and elegant, shining palace wall

having a candle holder on each one. The cots seem to go on for quite a while,
disappearing towards the north and south. The room is also almost immaculate,
the floor cleanly swept, and everything precisely put away. The Palace Guards
seem to be very well treated, and very organized. The door to the east leads
outside again, the thick wooden door looks unbreakable, especially as parts of
it are covered in a dullened iron.

      <roomdescription>The intersection in the hallway is grand to say the least. The stunning set of 
gilded double doors to the south are only out matched by the immense double 
doors of a smooth white stone towards the north. The wide hallway itself leads 
off towards the east and west, the smooth floors a glossy marble that one could
see their reflection in if they so desired.

      <roomdescription>Spacious is one way to describe this hallway, eight men could walk side by 
side unhindered in it. The walls are covered with exquisite paintings of
beautiful horses and prominant figures of the past. Candelbras rest at
intervals along the walls which keep the hallway brightly lit. Sounds of 
men talking can be heard to the south, behind a heavy looking wood door.
The sounds of metal scraping along metal can also be heard.

hallway. The marble floors gleam softly from it&apos;s pristine polished state and
large candelbras line the hallway to bring even more light to the area. The
north wall is filled with exotic tapestries of strange battles that happened
long ago. The ceiling is arched as well, crossed by gilded girders which gives
the hallway an air of richness as it leads to the east and west.

can only be described as luxerious decorate the white walls. Scenes of battles
long forgotten of the glorious calvary can be seen on the tapestries. To the
direct south a large, heavy wooden door can be seen. Sounds of men talking 
and armor rustling can be heard from that direction along with a camaraderie
laugh every now and then.

      <roomdescription>The wide and luxerious hallway enters a large and open area. A beautiful bay
window rests to the south, allowing streams of light to enter. The clean and
immaculately shined floor gleams brightly from the reflection of the light.
Paintings and exotic tapestries line the walls, hardly any space left to be
seen on them. The arched ceiling also gives the area a feeling of opennness,
the gilded girders shine a gleaming yellow and candelbras line the hallway
at regular intervals to give the area even more light.

the hallway is very brightly lit, while towards the east it seems to be a
bit more dim. The floors are kept immaculate and spotless, the exotic marble
glistening in it&apos;s polished sheen and the walls have no space left to them
from all the tapestries and paintings that line them. Candelbras line the
hallway at regular intervals to bring light to it, giving it an air of
mystery.

center of the marbled floor to lead off towards the north while the marbled
floor that least west is unadorned yet polished to a gleam. An extremely
large painting that takes up an entire portion of wall from the ceiling
to the floor rests on the eastern wall. The south wall has a very large
window that allows light to enter this slightly darkened corner of the
hallway, and large candelbras bring more light at regular intervals along
the hall.

      <roomdescription>A single candelabra sheds a soft glow over the snug alcove, letting shadows
play over the walls, giving the little nook a secluded feel. A plush settee
sits back against the wall, its over-stuffed cushions looking incredibly
inviting. In a tall vase several fragrant flowers flourish, their sweet
scent filling the air. Above the settee a window opens to the ogier grove,
the towering trees and shrubs, both exotic and common, forming a lush
background for the romantic alcove.
