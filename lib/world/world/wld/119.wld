      <roomdescription>Deep within this dark and \c23dank\c00 forest stands a small clearing.  Here, the
matted brush and leaves around the edges has squeezed the trees so tightly
there is no more room to grow, and a small clearing has been forced under the
overhanging \c02branches\c00.  There is a sound of dripping \c04water\c00 to the south, and to
the east and north small trails lead into the undergrowth.  The encroaching bulk
of huge trees blocks any passage to the east or west; only a few small
deer paths, probably going to or from the water that is audible off to the
south, penetrate this otherwise trackless gloom of branch and trunk.

      <roomdescription>The sound of dripping \c04water\c00 is strong here, coming from somewhere
off to the south.  This narrow deer path runs between the tangled trees, the
footprints of animals embedded deeply in it.  Perhaps they come for the water?
The very animals which made this track even now rustle in the undergrowth.  
The forest noises are not simply background noise - they are the sounds of
hundreds of small creatures living out their lives in desperation of being
eaten by bigger ones.  Perhaps that is an apt metaphor for life, for there are
certainly more dangerous things than \c03bears\c00 back in civilization.

edge as sharply as if they were cut with a knife.  Still wide enough for a
child to step over, it continues downstream to the south, or to its source in
the lake to the west.  Small branches and leaves tangle together in some places
to form miniature dams and pools, dead and floating vegetable matter swept along
by the current and caught by the tiny twigs.  Around the stream, damp soil
quickly fades to dry, packed \c02e\c03a\c02r\c03t\c02h\c00 among the trees.  The merry sound of the

about ten feet deep; the bottom is clearly visible through the clear, clean
water, running directly from the lake to the east.  To the south, towering
trees surround a natural clearing in the distance; to the north, a little path
runs, frequented by animals seeking water.  Noises in the undergrowth are a
constant reminder of the forest&apos;s dangerous inhabitants.

plate-sized \c03o\c01r\c08a\c10n\c03g\c01e\c00 fungi grow in layers up the side of the trunk, and termites
are busy eating much of the dead wood.  \c02Li\c09an\c02as\c00, mosses and other plants spread
across the fallen giant, clashing with the fungi in eye-watering combinations,
so that the tree almost looks like \c08T\c09i\c10n\c11k\c12e\c13r\c00 wagons in some parts.  From here, the

bored deep holes into the bark, giving the dead tree an almost comical look.  
Animals seem to have nibbled at the dead bark, leaving long, thin strips of the
\c14pale\c00 \c09t\c02r\c09e\c02e flesh\c00 visible.  The huge bulk of the tree dominates this area, making
it seem much smaller, but the lack of space is compensated for by the amount of
light; the tangles of lesser trees that the giant brought down when it fell are
all around, and the open \c13sky\c00 shows above.

      <roomdescription>The bulk of a huge tree stretches across the open space here, bright light
shocking after the darkness of the forest.  The giant must have brought down
almost every tree anywhere near it when it fell, for the sky is mercifully
\c13c\c06l\c07e\c14a\c13r\c00 here, and no leafy ceiling blocks out the light.  The tree itself is
huge; almost as big around as one of the Ogier Great Trees, it must have stood
here for centuries before rot and heaviness conspired to bring about its
demise.  But in the very \c23death\c00 is \c10life\c00; decomposing fungi and insects thrive on
the bark, and the huge amount of dead wood is ideal for many animals to feed or
live in.

      <roomdescription>A clump of \c23t\c08h\c01o\c23r\c08n\c00 bushes stands here, their heavy, spiny branches making the way
totally impassable to the north.  A small strip of \c01red\c00-\c03brown\c00 fur caught on a
branch gives evidence of some animal which was not careful enough; it seems
easy enough to accidentally lacerate oneself on the thick, curved spines of the
branches.  The \c02trees\c00 around the clump of thorns are no more welcoming; the
hanging branches and thick boles make for hard if not impossible passage.  
\c08Itch oak\c00 and \c05poison \c02i\c09v\c02y\c00 coil around the trunks and spill onto the ground, sly
traps for unwary walkers.  The vegetation is so thick here, laden with its
cargo of damp and rotting leaves, that is impossible to go anywhere but back to
the south-west.

made more by all the denizens of the forest traversing their home than any
human interference.  Not even the print of a shod hoof is visible on the

occasional stone litters the gritty sand and shingles, huge humps

shingle a soothing music permeating the edge of the \c02f\c09o\c02r\c09e\c02s\c09t\c00.  However, there is
one outlet of the lake, into a fast-flowing \c14s\c13t\c14r\c13e\c14a\c13m\c00 just narrow enough to avoid
being termed a river.  The water flows out of the lake in a swift, steady
stream, the stream&apos;s \c23stone\c00 banks worn away by the slow, steady power of
decades.  Lapping over tiny stone outcrops and winding down to the south-west,
eventually drifting and disappearing into the forest, the water makes a steady,
\c04aq\c11ua\c13ti\c06c\c00 music.  It vanishes into the trees to the south-west, a small path
following its progress.  It is just wide enough to jump across here, but seems
to widen more as it continues.  To the North, the shore of the lake continues

by trees - sweetgums and others tangle together to make an impassable wall.  
However, the lake to the east of here is certainly not invisible; the trees
vanish just a short way before the rocky beach begins, not fading but rather
stopping completely at the boundary of the dark \c03soil\c00.  The way underfoot is
treacherous to man or beast; apart from the dead and rotting leaves, the soil
is \c03d\c06a\c03m\c06p\c00 and occasionally even boggy.  From here, the only choices of movement
are east to the lake, or west to a small deer path running through the trees.

and leatherleaves drop their cargo of brown and yellow leaves to the forest
floor, where some are already starting to rot gently.  The \c03brownish\c00-\c23black\c00
carpet gives a rustling sound in some places, where dead leaves crackle at the
slightest pressure.

the thick, sharp thorns effectively block any further passage except to the

hang from the branches, a thinner crop than most years would have seen.  The

mixing together indiscriminately, cover the ground, overhung by the shadows of
their taller brethren.  Slim, almost emaciated silver birches tower over the
forest floor, letting little light in, and that pale and washed-out.  The trees
cut the breeze a little, so inside the forest is a little less windy, if not
less cold.  Further along to the east, past the source of the water, large
trees loom in the darkness, centarian oaks denying saplings light or space.

      <roomdescription>Mud banks and piled-up \c23silt\c00, carried down the river from further
upstream, have combined here to create an eddy of calm water in the midst of
the fast-flowing river.  The curving ripple of the eddy line stretches down
from the blockade, clearly visible on the surface of the water, gently curving
before disappearing in the raging torrent.  Inside the eddy, small
\c23s\c07i\c14l\c23v\c07e\c14r\c00-scaled fish swim among the waving fronds of

broken only by the occasional ripple as something startles one of the fry.  
Downstream, the river flows straight on to the south, bordered by the forest on
one side and grassland to the other.  Upstream, however, the river bends,
taking a turn to the east suddenly before its source to the north-east of here.

from here; the wide trunk is dry on the upturned side, with branches sticking
out at irregular intervals, providing natural handholds.  The river continues
its passage to the south, and a sound of rushing water some way upstream

The banks themselves are carved at first into the soft loam of the forest, but
deeper under the water, the river has carved a passage into the very \c23stone\c00.  
From here, the river bends, flowing out of its straight north-south passage to

seems not to have been touched by man in centuries.  In the soft \c03earth\c00

wild inhabitants.  Rustlings in the undergrowth add to the illusion of being
watched that comes from the sightless branches of the bare trees.  The

the forest acts as an effective \c14windbreak\c00 for most of the nastier \c13gales\c00.  From

nameless tributaries are poured into its banks.  To the west, one fork bends

the surface.  The thick branch of the river is almost certainly impassable
without a ferry, and there is not so much as a rope strung across the turgid
currents.  The only way to get to the far side of either bank seems to go back
north, and find a narrower crossing point.  However, just visible around a
curve is a \c03log\c00, slanting across the line of the river so as to be pointing
directly south; an intrepid traveller might be able to make their way across
it.  Over the river to the south-east and south-west, trees fade sharply, and
\c02grassland\c00 is visible nearby.  The river thickens directly to the south,
eventually running all the way down into Tarabon.  Fed by numerous streams and
tributaries on the way, it finally flows through Tanchico and into the Aryth.
However, wherever this river flows, it must be into a lighter land than this
dank and gloomy forest.

Almoth Plain.  The \c03marsh\c00, however, is surrounded on trees to all sides,
although a lightening in the air to the south suggests perhaps a clearing or
maybe even an end to the forest altogether.

the forest loses its hold on the land, to be replaced by straggling bushes and

this place, between mountain to the east, forest to the north and plain to the

The eye of a watcher would be caught and held by the snowy tops of these

From here, the river continues to the North, eventually coming to its source as
it thins.  To the South, the sound of rushing water is audible as it meets the
other branch.  A narrow path leads through the \c02tr\c09ee\c02s\c00, which are forced aside by

to the West are so thick as to be impenetrable, and to the East the river

the willows do not bloom this late in the year, but they stand proud and

the water begins to run faster as if to make up for its delay.  The clear water

      <roomdescription>Broadening out as it moves further along, this tributary of the Andahar becomes
a little shallower.  No longer wide enough to jump over, it is yet too \c11deep\c00
to wade comfortably; the fast-flowing water discourages any thought of that, at
any rate.  In the soft earth at the sides of the river, tracks of \c03deer\c00 and
smaller \c01fox\c00-prints show how valuable the water is for the inhabitants of the
forest.  Upstream, to the north and east, lies the huge \c06l\c13a\c11k\c04e\c00 that
borders this wood; downstream, south and west of here, this river joins another
to form the true Andahar.

Rustles from the darkness speak of wild \c03boar\c00, of \c23ra\c01ve\c23ns\c00 and deer, insects and

\c23fog\c00, \c02marsh\c00 and tree.  From here, to the north the spring is visible through a

      <roomdescription>A strong, gushing \c06st\c13re\c11am\c00 flows out of the rock here, shooting
out of its underground source straight into the banks it has carved for itself
over the centuries.  The \c23rocks\c00 and even the \c13air\c00 are damp with a
constant mist of \c14spray\c00 from the spring, the moist but cold air
refreshing after the dankness of the inner forest.  From here, a traveller
could cross the river to the west now, at its source; this swift-flowing
tributary of the Andahar does not have a ford for quite a way downstream.  The
forest peters out directly beyond the stream to the west, or grows quickly more
\c02dense\c00 to the east.  The tributary also continues to the south, where
some way downstream it meets its sister tributary to form the mighty Andahar.

From here, the forest fades to the north, huge trees replaced by saplings and

The base of the tree was obviously here; huge roots stick up from the bole of
the tree.  At its base, this was obviously at least twenty feet around, perhaps
more - the huge giant is almost too big to comprehend.  In the space carved out
by the roots when it fell, this tree has created a small pit or hole, carved
into the dark, moist \c03earth\c00.  There is a space between two leg-thick roots, just
large enough to squeeze into, and enter down into the \c23cavern\c00.

      <roomdescription>A darkness has fallen over the forest here, muffling even the harsh cries of
the birds from above the treetops.  Only a little way south and east of the
very edge of the forest, it still seems to be deep in some trackless, murky
wood.  The trees that block any light from falling from the sky have bark
almost as dark as the black, loamy soil underfoot; it seems unhealthy, not
visibly stricken with \c23r\c03o\c23t\c00 or disease yet not the usual appearance of bark all
the same.  Underneath, a tangle of bushes and underbrush blocks the way for
most passage; it, too, looks half-dead.  The only thing that seems to flourish
here are clumps of deadly \c08De\c01at\c23hs\c08ca\c01p\c00 mushroom, their dark \c03brown\c00 gills giving
off an evil scent to the air.

seem to be a little fresher, slightly more alive than the rest of the forest,

lead away from the clearing; they travel off to the north and south, frequented
only by deer and other animals of the forest.  No shod hoofprint, no track of
boot or shoe suggests that any human has been here in the last hundred years.
To the south, a \c10lighter\c00 area suggests another gap in the trees, and the huge

solid, dark outer bark; its length stretches along the ground, with saplings
and larger trees growing around and over it.  The huge amount of fungi that

\c01or\c08an\c10ge\c00 fungus has grown to the size of plates, ringing the trunk.  Long grass

enclosing parts of the trunk in a \c23cave\c00 of \c02greenery\c00.  To the north, a clump of
evergreens lighten the dark mood of the forest; across to the west, the sound
of a \c06s\c13t\c11re\c13a\c06m\c00 or river breaks the profound silence and stillness of this place.

Vines and lianas climb the giant trees, strangling some, peacefully encircling
others.  The few beams of \c10sunlight\c00 that do show through the roof of leaves

      <roomdescription>Here, in the shade provided by a large \c07s\c14i\c23lv\c14e\c07r\c00 birch, \c05f\c04l\c02o\c11w\c02e\c04r\c05s\c00 and bright bushes
have grown and blossomed.  Confused by the endless heat of the summer and the
\c14winter\c00 before that, they have now put forth flowers in the middle of what
should be \c01au\c08tu\c10mn\c00, or winter.  The deep \c04b\c11l\c04u\c11e\c00 flowers of a foot-tall Monkshood
plant are already starting to wither and die in the inhospitable conditions;
\c12foxgloves\c00 and other hardy plants seem to have suffered a similar fate, some
drooping and broken.  In the undergrowth, bushes grow to three feet tall and
provide cover for all manner of animals, small and large; the sounds of deer
and wild boar drift through the breeze.

      <roomdescription>A stand of \c03beeches\c00 among the other trees of the forest adds some \c08cr\c01im\c08so\c01n\c00 to the
dark \c03browns\c00 and \c22blacks\c00 of the rest of the forest.  Their leaves, gloriously
bright with the red of \c01au\c08tu\c10mn\c00, seem to rustle and crackle with the slightest
breeze; many have already fallen to the ground and lie, stirred by the
slightest movement or breeze, covering the dark loam with a carpet of leaves.
Further off to the east, the forest seems to thin a little before dying out
altogether, the land taken over by the harsh Mountains of Mist that loom above
the trees.  From here, snow is just visible on the \c23cloud\c00-wreathed peaks; a few
straggly \c09evergreens\c00, pines and firs mainly, hold on up the slopes before the
treeline slices into them, cutting them short like a knife.

    <roombasic title="North of the marshes" vnum="11996" zone="119">
      <roomdescription>Visible through the thickly-packed and brooding trees, a marsh lies directly to
the south of here.  The \c03loam\c00 of the forest, overrun with runoff from the many
rivers and streams traversing this wood, turns into a boggy mass of peat and
marsh \c02gr\c03as\c02se\c03s\c00.  To the north lies a path of sorts, a trail used by deer and the
like to traverse this reputedly trackless forest; past there, \c10sunlight\c00 filters
down onto the earth through occasional gaps in the branches overhead,
illuminating piles of damp leaf litter and the occasional den or burrow of some
small forest animal.  In the surrounding undergrowth, the sound of rustlings
and scrapings indicate insects and the like; along with other sounds that might
be the larger inhabitants of the forest.  It is said that there are bears
living in this part of the world....

    <roombasic title="On the edge of the Forest" vnum="11997" zone="119">
      <roomdescription>The light quality seems to be dingy here, halfway between the deep darkness of
the main forest and the slightly \c23grayish\c00 sunlight that manages to break through
the overhanging clouds on the open grasslands to the south and west.  The soil
underfoot seems damp, although with recent \c04r\c11a\c04i\c11n\c04s\c00 or runoff from the many
streams and occasional rivers that sweep through the forest is unclear.  The
fallen leaves that carpet the entire forest rustle weakly, and only occasional
\c13breezes\c00 can penetrate the screen of \c02firs\c00 and other evergreens that flourish on
the outskirts of the forest.  To the east, the peaks of the Mountains of Mist
rise above the trees of the forest, their tops invisible in the ever-present
cloud that gives them their name.  To the north, little is visible but more
forest; the trees grow so thick that clear sight is impossible for more than a
few paces.

      <roomdescription>The forest comes to an almost abrupt halt here, the river breaking out of the
gloom and into the pale sunlight that seems bright by comparison to what is
visible of the interior.  Flowing south and a little west, the Andahar streams
swiftly over its bank of \c03loam\c00 and \c23gravel\c00.  To the north, upstream, a roaring
can be heard, as if there is some disturbance of the water; a meeting of
tributaries, perhaps.  This impression is enhanced by a few glimpses of what
seems to be one branch of the river, north and east; thinner than the main
branch, it is bridged by a fallen \c02tr\c09ee\c00 or \c03log\c00, beyond which the main bulk of
the forest spreads.  To the west, past the dark expanse of the forest, lies
Almoth Plain; east, the land is hedged in by the brooding, \c23cl\c06ou\c14dy\c00 peaks of the
Mountains of Mist.

      <roomdescription>The trees of the forest loom directly to the north here, their \c23darkness\c00 almost
a tangible presence.  They seem to have faded to the south, though, what trees
there are being thinner and seemingly mostly \c02n\c09e\c02w \c09g\c02r\c09o\c02w\c09t\c02h\c00.  The forest is
spreading; more new saplings are appearing at the fringes, those that are not
starved of light by the spreading branches of the taller giants.  Almost as
soon as the first line of trees, a darkness seems to descend over the forest;
despite the pale sunlight filtering through from overhead, it isn&apos;t possible to
see more than ten feet into the forest before the gloom swallows all.  To the
south, a bleaker if less dark picture is presented; broken by the occasional
\c04river\c00, and of course the spreading line of the Andahar that has its source in
this forest and the lake to the east, a grassy plain spreads to the south and
east, almost devoid of settlement or evidence of human contact.
