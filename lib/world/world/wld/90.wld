    <roombasic title="The Winter Garden" vnum="9000" zone="90">
      <roomdescription>This is a hardy garden that is green year round, but especially during the
winter months.  There are a number of fruit trees providing the First's
table with a assortment of jams and fruit-flavoured teas.  It is said that
all Firsts have enjoyed the solitude offered by the small summer house and
greenhouse.  The iron benches that decorate the lawn have a wonderful
patina and intricately fashioned legs and backs.  The sundial casts a long
shadow marking the passing hours while the splashing fountains of marble
offer a cool respite.  By far the grand treasure of the garden isn't its
babbling brook or fancy scrolled fire pits, but rather the tiny birds with
jewel-like feathers that cluster round the bird baths and scattering of
seeds.

    <roombasic title="The Chamber of the First" vnum="9001" zone="90">
      <roomdescription>This majestic room has a floor tiled in black marble.  The walls are
heavily molded and has a thick chair rail that goes completely around the
room.  The ceiling forms into a great dome set with inserts of polished
horn.  Against one of the walls is a bed carved in the shape of a golden
eagle in flight with its wings outstretched as if soaring up the wall.  
Its eyes are inlaid abalone shell that has been dyed red and the beak is
fashioned from ebony.  Aside from the grand bed, the other furnishings
appear rather modest.  There is an antique changing screen and next to it
is a dressing table with perfumes, powders and jewels for the hair.  A
sofa, several chairs, wine cabinet and fireplace are located near the
triple arched windows paned with polished horn.

      <roomdescription>The library here is a very modest one though the First of Mayene is quite
interested in books.  Most of the collection consists of journals kept by
former Firsts of Mayene.  There is a single bookcase in the room and it is
built in the shape of a house having a gable roof, small dormer windows
and ornamentation.  Wooden doors close up the bookcase and are usually
kept locked at all times.  The library room has a few reading chairs
before a fireplace that is shared with the sitting room.  There is also a
nice reading table with a couple of oil lamps.  Through the archway is the
small sitting room with a sofa poised before the hawk gilded fireplace and
clusters of over stuffed chairs are clustered about the room.  Upon the
floor is a plush carpet patterned with yellow hawks.

      <roomdescription>The First of Mayene maintains her own private banquet hall for more
personal audiences.  The table is made of night wood and has three carved
hawks forming the pedestal.  There are chairs enough to seat a dozen
people with ease.  A great brocade with the Mayene golden hawk stitched
upon it, hangs from the center of the ceiling and can be moved back and
forth by servants to fan the guests.  At one end of the room is a side
table from which the meals are served.  Of course, there is a taster
always in attendance.

      <roomdescription>It would be possible to mistake these quarters for those of moderately
well-off merchants, despite the fact that they are indeed servants
quarters.  The quality of the several beds, including the sheets and
blankets on them, is obvious.  Also, of fine quality are the dressers and
chairs, carefully carved from ironwood.  Everything in the room including
the furnishings, bedding, clothing and personal items are all arranged
neatly and orderly.  On the southeast wall is a door leading to the
kitchens, and to the east a door leading to another such room.  Liveried
servants are usually moving through here, changing shifts, or sleeping, as
their duties command.

ordered place where the female servants of the palace reside.  In front if
each bed there is a small chest for the servants personal belongings.  On
the north wall there is a door leading to the male part of the servants'
quarters.  Servants move in and out of these rooms almost constantly, some
to sleep until their shifts start again and some to just relax in their
off time.  Hundreds of beds lines the walls of this large room where most
of the male servants live.  In front of all of the beds there is a small
chest where the male servants store their own things, like a pipe and
tabac, an instrument or some other small things.

      <roomdescription>One of the busiest rooms in the whole palace, the wash room has a
cobblestone pavement which slopes to drain off the water, Several copper
tubs sit upon their own wooden platform with water pump so clothing can be
rinsed.  Another cluster of great kettles have fires roaring under them
which the wood-boys keep fed so the washer-servants can boil the clothing
clean as they stir them with large wooden paddles.  After the clothing as
been rinsed it is hung on lines of rope that has been strung between
wooden T-shaped poles.  After being left out in the sun to dry, the
clothing is gathered, folded and then delivered to the servants.  
Clothing-ironers faithfully heat their irons and work at keeping the
wrinkles out of clothing, Their job is an unending one.  A special group
of servants are stain-removers and all they do is work to remove stains
from clothing.  Of course, if clothing requires mending it goes to the
menders who repair tears, ripped seams, and sew on lost buttons.  Darners
darn the socks and stockings.

The chairs have wooden seats and backs carved of soaring hawks and clouds.

on a raised dais is a throne, though the First of Mayene just calls it the
great chair.  This is a much larger hall than the receiving hall.

about the room are exquisite carvings of Mayene oil ships, cargo boats and
pleasure boats.  A well-equipped wine cabinet stands near the fireplace.
It is obviously a room that is meant to promote conversation.

      <roomdescription>The palace kitchen is a marvelous place filled with pots, pans, kettles,
skillets, whisks, bowls, wooden spoons and sharp knives.  There is a small
army of servant such as the head cook and undercooks, choppers, slicers,
dicers, poultry dressers, baker, under-bakers, peelers, mashers, brewers,
head pastry chef and their assistants.  In addition, there are all the
servants needed for cleaning up, such as the pan scrappers, pot scrubbers,
dish washers, rinsers and dryers.  The wood-boys are needed to gather the
wood and bring it in and the fire-boys watch and maintain the fires.  
Spit-boys turn the spits hung heavy with meat.  The head butcher oversees
the butchers at the palace slaughter house and makes sure the cows, sheep,
pigs, deer, fowl and fish are all cut, smoked and hung properly.  The head
butcher also makes sure the head cook has exactly the meats needed for the
menu of the day.  The kitchen is a busy place during meal preparation, but
also with the meal servers entering and leaving to actually serve the
palace table, but all is kept running smoothly by the head cook, and head
baker.

      <roomdescription>All the walls are lined with sturdy shelves.  A variety of dry goods such
as barley, oats, rice, beans, tea leaves, wheat, flour, peas, rye and
sugar can be found in sacks on the stone flooring.  Every year canning
takes place and have yielded jars of jams, jellies, pickles, relish,
tomatoes, corn, onions and such.  Bags of dried fruit, vegetables and
herbs can also be found upon these shelves.  Of course, since this is the
palace pantry many exotic items can also be found such as raisins, rose
petals, cocoa beans, ground kaff and dried ice peppers.  On one wall, all
the main silver pieces are stored.  A center table is where the silver is
cleaned by the silver cleaner while the silver polisher works along side
the silver cleaner to keep each item bright and shiny.  The silver keeper
maintains a watchful eye over all the silver pieces and makes new
purchases and sees to the repairs of damaged pieces as needed.  The palace
steward and the silver keeper are the only ones with keys to the pantry.

refined tastes.  The tables are sturdy and well suited to the Captain's
needs.  An armoire is of simple construction, but has a border of carved
hawks.  The armoire holds all of his uniforms.  His great-grandfather's
sword is proudly displayed over the fireplace mantle.  The bed is the only
ornate piece of furniture in the room and it is obviously a gift.  A nice
thick carpet lies on the floor.  A sofa is before the fireplace flanked by
one chair with a footstool and there is a wine cabinet to one side of the
fireplace.  A large family portrait is on the wall opposite the fireplace.
On the left side of the fireplace is a rack for holding swords.  There is
a large dog in the room.  Probably a pet, but also the Captain's alarm
should anyone attempt to enter his room unannounced.

behind it.  Flanking each side of the desk are carved hawks.  The skill of
the carver is plainly evident in these hawks as they seem to appear
intelligent, attentive and likely to take flight at any moment.  Several
bear rugs are scattered around the room covering most of the oak flooring
with its wide planks.  Stuffed animals such as a lion, tiger, bear,
monkey, alligator, panther and something so exotic that it could only have
come out of the Drowned Lands, can be found snarling in the corners of the
room amid potted foliage.  There are a variety of framed maps upon the
walls as well as a fine display of weapons both ancient and modern.  The
great oak cabinet with its inlaid turquoise is fully stocked with the
finest wines.  The sofa before the marbled fireplace is upholstered in
tiger pelts and the pillows are stuffed panther pelts.  It is a frequently
whispered rumour that the Captain keeps his office secure with hidden
traps.

some of the food, but most is brought in directly to the banquet hall from
the kitchen.  The right side of the First of Mayene is strictly reserved
for the court taster, which is quite an important role given the

a fountain shaped like a tree and this garden is an orchard having a
variety of fruit trees.  It is from the fruits that most of the juices,
jellies and jams are made.  The fourth garden has a fountain shaped like a
watering can and this garden is a flower garden whose flowers decorate the
palace as well as provide some of the perfumes.  The fifth garden has a
fountain shaped like an acorn and this garden is an orchard of nut-bearing
trees.  It is highly prized for both its nuts and oils produced from the
nuts.  The sixth garden has a fountain shaped like a frog and its garden
has a variety of herbs used both in cooking and in the potions of the
palace herbalist.  Also a great variety of mushrooms and truffles grow in
this garden.

    <roombasic title="The Waiting Hall" vnum="9021" zone="90">
      <roomdescription>This mid-hall is a waiting hall for those who have been fortunate enough
to gain entrance from the common hall.  This hall is meant to impress
visitors and to serve as a reminder to the nobility and people of Mayene
that the power of the country lies with the ruling First and the Seconds.
It is a grand space carved of cold, black marble.  Everywhere one looks,
the golden hawk of Mayene and be seen in all its pride and splendour.  
Round in shape, its ceiling crowns the room with a dome containing
polished panes of horn that wash the room in golden hues.  All around the
great rotunda are portraits of the Firsts through time.  Between the
portraits are winged statues of Mayene's golden hawks perched upon
pedestals of black marble.

      <roomdescription>This hall is often used y the merchants who are not part of a noble
family.  Here their petitions to the First can be heard.  Often times the
issues resolved in this hall are concerning trade and trade agreements.  
It used to be a place where taxes could be paid, but that is now handled
through the courthouse.  The hall is the largest and there is a raised
dais with a chair at one end because the First of Mayene does make
appearances in this room from time to time and more commonly one of the
Seconds of Mayene will appear.  Issues concerning the oilshoals are given
top priority and are considered more of an issue of state than trade.  
There are rows of low benching that curves in a gentle arch and three
aisles between them.  On three sides of the room are tables set up with
notaries and other officials of the court who take care of the routine
matters.

where actors and actresses practice their art.  The stage has a semi-
permanent two story building on one side, curtains across the front and
the means to readily change the set and backgrounds.  Flanking the main
stage on both sides are smaller stages for the musicians to play providing
their listeners with a stereo-effect.  Around the room are hidden doors
behind which contain storage for tables and chairs which can be easily set
up or removed with the usual troop of palace servants.  It is considered
quite an honour to be invited to the palace for a performance.  Of course,
it is equally true that a few unscheduled performances of assassination
and kidnapping have been staged by that notorious country, Tear.

gardeners shape shrubbery into a variety of shapes such as a deer, horse,

star, half moon, an archer, a cup, wishing well and a smoking pipe.  
Every year the ten best gardeners in Mayene are invited to the palace to
compete and the winner's topiary is planted in the garden with a bronze
plaque and the gardener given a velvet hand sack of silver coins.  
Invitations are extended to about two hundred children every year to visit
the gardens and it is considered an honour to receive one of these
invitations.  There are a number of wooden benches located all along the
garden's wandering paths.

A small window on the east side is perhaps just large enough for a small

shows the dust particles as they float through the air.  In the center of
the floor is a trap door from which even a large adult could gain access
to the structure.  An old rug lies next to this door on the floor rolled
up to reveal the trap door.  A small table rests on the far wall, opposite
from the window, and there is a wooden crate used for a chair.  A hammock
is strung sturdily across the structure.  The tree house creaks and sways
gently with the tree.

Rich marble columns of salmon support an arched ceiling painted with some

lamps so that the columns themselves offer up light.  The floor is also
made of a white marble tiles with salmon veins running throughout the
tiles.  On each side of the hall are benches padded with gold velvet.  In
the center of the entry hall is a marble fountain surrounded by urns of
lush greenery.  The small bushes, greenery and topiary scent the aire with
flowers and are inhabited by tiny birds that have the most extravagant
plumage.

      <roomdescription>As might be expected, these are probably the best stables in all Mayene.
Each stable has an individual design as if this were a city of horse
houses.  The door of each stall has a brass plate with the name of the
horse engraved upon it.  There are also a number of stalls with the word
'Guest' engraved upon the stall door, and these are used by the visiting
nobles and dignitaries to the Mayene Palace.  Fresh hay is laid down twice
a day and the horses are fed the best grains.  A healer of horses can
often be seen massaging a horse's leg or applying some poultice.  These
stables are a very busy place with stable boys constantly hurrying about
and grooming and exercising horses.  The stable hands are careful to write
down the instructions given by the nobles for the care of their horses.  
At the end of the stable lies a rather large office that belongs to the
Stable Master.

leaving a wide lane down the middle which leads out to the western doors,
joining with the Palace Road.  A short wall separates the carriages from
each other, although the tops of the carriages can be seen rising above
the walls.  Large pillars rise to the ceiling to support it, the symbol of
the Mayene throne carved onto each.  Some of the carriages are round in
shape, while others appear to be more like large boxes, but all are
ornately decorated with edging in gold and silver.  Many are painted with
a red color, although a few bear other colors such as blue and white.  
Each has a small step attached to it just below the door, and a bench seat
in front for the driver of the carriage.  The finest silks and brocades
decorate the interiors of the carriages.  Oil lanterns are mounted outside
as well as inside the carriages.  Most of the carriages are filled with
fine details such as fragrant rose petals and pomades of jasmine scenting
the interiors, a delicate bud vases mounted near the door, and small
oil-treated awnings over the windows to keep out the rain.

The saddle blankets are quilted with fine stitches patterned in leaves and
hawks, and of the brightest colours trimmed in gold braid.  The finely
tooled leather saddles are a feast for the eyes, designed with a narrow
tree and round high pommel and cantle.  The saddles have a guarnicion, a
unique tail piece that is attached to the rear of the saddle and covers
the crupper and the tail, many adorned with intricate engraved art.  The
stirrups are usually pyramid-shaped, and made of wood.  They have metal
loops at the top which allows the stirrup to revolve for easier mounting.
Most of the saddles are the colour of honey, olive, straw, ginger, dark
brown and studded with silver.

richly designed carpet.  It is not uncommon to see house guards and the
wing guard walking about the halls as well as messengers and servants.

      <roomdescription>Some say the diamond mounted in the house sigil above the fireplace is
real, if it is then it is certainly the only one in this room that is
real.  The rest are facetted sea glass.  There are two sofas flanking the
fireplace and two chairs in the front.  Several elegant tables can be
found throughout the room including a rather large one that the family
sometimes takes their meals.  The carpet on the floor is a family heirloom
and comes from Tanchico.  The room is well lighted with many oil lamps.  
The lamps are studded with facetted sea glass that is how this suite came
to be called the Diamond suite.

are popular subjects for painters.  The servants cook downstairs in the
main kitchen and bring the dishes upstairs to their masters.

is a wall down most of the room, dividing it between the house guards and
the servants.  Both rooms have worn rugs of ruby-red that have been
repaired many times.  The beds are made of polished wood and there is a
trunk at the foot of each bed and a small table near the bed to hold
little objects they possess.  A couple of simple wardrobes help keep the
uniforms looking their best.  A wash stand is near the door and a copper
hip-tub holds spare linen and balls of soap, but is emptied once a week
for baths.  Spare weapons are hung on the guard's side of the room and
spare armour is hung on a wooden stand.

rug that runs the length of the room.  The washstand by the door is made
of brass to maintain that golden appearance.  On the opposite side of the
door is a shaving stand.  The men occupy one side of the room and the
women occupy the other side.  A wall runs own each side o the hall
creating small areas about the size of a closet, but very private.  At the

socialize.  In the commons is a sofa, several high-back chairs and a few

      <roomdescription>From the ceiling medallion hangs a brass chandelier fashioned like
branches and holds eighteen candles.  A pair of banquettes are covered in
a striking geometric design of blue and peach.  A painting of two noble
women, probably sisters is hung opposite the banquettes.  Below the
painting is a table with legs carved like perched hawks.  One of the
Mayene nobles is notorious for writing the most erotic love letters, never
mentioning any name and leaving it carelessly on this table.  These
letters fuel much the gossip around the court romances.

woman goes to work ironing and pressing the wrinkles out of the clothing.
By necessity this whole room is made of stone to prevent fires.  There are
also several chimneys to allow the smoke from the fires to escape outside.
Next to the door is the woodpile that fees the fires.  The inn stays quite
busy just with its laundry business.

      <roomdescription>This small room is perpetually dim, no matter what time of day it happens
to be.  It's plain wooden walls are unmarred and smooth except for a
single window, no more then a foot and a half wide built into the northern
wall, which is covered by a curtain hung outside it.  The bottom half of
this window is a half door that allows entrance to this room, but the
curtain hangs such that it hides the door knob for gaining entrance.  The
half door is so well constructed that the seams can not be seen unless one
knows to look for them.  The curtain, conveniently, can be seen through
from inside, allowing a clear but limited view of the private dining area
for about four or five feet beyond the curtain.  The condition of the room
suggests that this is an often-used way to spy on the happenings in the
private dining hall.

      <roomdescription>This is a large shop that contains a variety of pottery, most of it made
in Mayene.  There are great and small water holders made of pottery and
strung with a leather cord hanging on the wall behind the main counter
where the owner is often working on arranging the wares to their best
advantage.  Large vases with coloured patterns of flowers, geometric
patterns, and historical scenes line the south wall.  Inside one of the
wooden cases is a collection of clay smoking pipes.  There are sensible
items as well such as those used in most any kitchen.  Shelves cover the
western wall and contain pottery of various shapes and sizes all the way
down to the wooden plank floor.

      <roomdescription>This is a rugged shop where staves and hoops are turned into everything
from butter churns to tubs.  Some of the casks made here included the
firkin, kilderkin, hogshead, butt, rundlet, tierce, puncheon, and pipe.  
The tight copper assembles clear white oak staves split from the tree's
dense center, fits them one to another, and then binds them with iron to
make casks for liquids of all sorts.  The slack cooper builds containers
for such commodities as flour and tabac.  The copper produces pails,
churns, tubs, and dippers, often of cedar or pine.  They shape their
staves with broadaxes, planes, and drawknives, then gather them in a
circle secured by a ring.  The gathered staves are heated over a small
stove or cresset to make them pliant and are bent to shape.  Hickory hoops
hold them for banding.  The trickiest step is cutting grooves inside the
lips to fit the barrelheads tightly.  Assistants help the coopers while
young boys keep the floor swept, maintain the tools, fetch water and keep
the fires fed.

      <roomdescription>The orphanage is, at first sight, very utilitarian.  It is a narrow room,
but very long to fit numerous beds.  There are fifteen simple wooden beds
arranged perpendicular to the left wall, each with a wooden chest at the
foot for clothing and small personal effects of the children.  Towards the
back wall is a kind of common room set around a fireplace for cold Mayene
nights.  There is a table with two benches, able to fit about twelve at a
time.  The table is littered with various games such as snakes and foxes,
stones, and dice, The room is obviously used to house numerous young
people, but a decided effort has been made to make this place feel like
home.

      <roomdescription>This room is an organized clutter of materials.  Bolts of cloth lay about
and are constantly being whisked back and forth as assistants try to
please the clientele.  There are tables where the cloth is cut from
patterns designed by the head seamstress.  A cluster of sewers work
frantically to stitch the patterned pieces together, while another cluster
of embellishers sew on buttons, jewels, sequins and such.  There is one
who works in leathers while another only works with furs.  The head
seamstress oversees the pace and quality of the work.  There are wooden
racks to hold the dresses in their various stages of completion.  Pins and
needles are scattered everywhere and the sewers often use the chairs they
sit in as pincushions.  Measuring tape, stripes of bone, threads, scissors
and scrapes of material can be found everywhere.  The shops cleaner has a
nice side business in scrapes that she sells to women who could never
afford more than a small square of such wonderful material.

      <roomdescription>Definitely a favourite among women, this dress shop has great tracery
windows that flank the main door and display a sampling of the wares
within the shop.  Several great wooden racks contain a number of completed
dresses.  This shop caters to the wealthy of Mayene and men often frequent
this shop as well seeking gifts.  There are three platforms where a lady
can stand in her new dress and have it hemmed and adjusted to her unique
figure.  Although it is still common to have a dress maker arrive at a
noble's estate or the palace to make dresses, it has become increasingly
popular to visit this shop as it gives the nobles another social
opportunity to gossip and make or ruin a reputation.  There are fabulously
expensive full-length mirrors in the shop.  Numerous sofas, plush
upholstered chairs and richly inlaid tables can be found clustered
throughout the shop.  Tea and little cakes are served all during the day
as well as a light midday meal.  Oil lamps with cut crystal shades provide
extra lightening.

hand made usually of wood.  However, this shop also caters to the wealthy

for children.  For adults there are wooden board games involving wooden
pegs or carved pieces.  There are games such as chess, stones, dice, and
snakes and foxes.  Hand painted car games can also be found here, such as
the Great Game of Houses, but the cards are so expensive that only the
wealthy can afford them.  There are cards for the common people such as
The Farming Land Game, The Merchant's Enterprise and Great Ship Battles.
There are also regular decks of cards for gambling.  The shop is lined
with shelves displaying the current wares.  A counter is located near the
door with a ledger upon it.  The cash box is out of sight.

horse shoes clicking on the cobbles is the constant music of the streets.
The road is very wide.  In addition to numerous carts, carriages and

      <roomdescription>This is the highest portion of the bridge as it spans across the Berona
Canal.  The canal below is quite scenic with its blue waters and black
gondola boats.  Golden fish swim lazily along the canal.  Fishing in the
canal is only allowed when the moon is in the waxing crescent phase.  
Moonlight fishing is a favourite pastime, but it is customary to throw
back one's catch while keeping score of how many catches one can make in a
given outing.  The boats that carry cargo always have the cargo draped.  
Most of the traffic along the canal are people being shuttled along the
canal.  Many nobles have homes located along the canal because of its
beauty.

be painted white, quite nondescript in comparison to the manors of

      <roomdescription>The blacksmith fashions useful items from iron and steel for the city's
households and their fellow tradesmen.  With forge and anvil, hammer and
tongs, he works up agricultural tools for the farmer and tires for the
wheelwright, and they repaired many of the iron objects used by Mayene
residents.  His skills with vise and file serve customers as diverse as
the miller, saddler, coachmaker, and planter.  For the householder he
casts, bents, welds, and rivets fireplace backs, andirons, pothooks,
locks, utensils, and decorative wrought iron.  A blacksmith's forge is a
raised brick hearth outfitted with bellows to feed its soft-coal fire and
a hood to carry away the smoke.  The forge heats bars of iron yellow-hot;
with his journeymen and apprentices, the smith then uses sledges weighing
as much as 12 pounds to hammer the bars into shape.  From steel he makes
tempered cutting edges for axes and smooth faces for special hammers.

a drainage ditch to prevent the road from flooding during the rainy

double doors suggesting it is a stable.  The building is greyish in colour

a while but do not wish to purchase one.  These people come here, to the
Stables.  Here they can leave their horses, for a night or for a month if
needs be, provided they can pay the rent and provided they cover the cost
of the fodder.  If they cannot pay, then the horse itself is taken as
payment.  The Keeper of this establishment rents out those horses whose
owners have been unable to keep and thus turns a tidy profit.  The stables
themselves are kept spotless by the many stable hands that work here, the
Keeper employing only the best in the trade and paying well.  The building
appears new, and indeed many of the stalls have the look of freshly cut
timber about them.  But the air is heavy with all the scents that come
with horses; oats, dung and horseflesh mixed with the smell of hay.  All
the tack is stored neatly along one wall of the building and everything is
well kept.

      <roomdescription>Made of wood and bound with iron, the wheels of the carriages, wagons, and
riding chairs that navigate the Mayene roads has to be strong and tight,
but first of all round.  Producing them requires strength and ingenuity,
some of the talents of the carpenter and the blacksmith.  Good measuring
skills were also needed.  The wheelwright starts with a hub fashioned on a
lathe from a properly aged wood like elm.  A tapered reamer opens the
center to receive a metal bearing, and the chisel creates rectangular
holes to take the spokes around the circumference.  Carved from woods like
ash, the spokes radiate to meet a rim of mortised wooden arches called
fellies that joins to form a perfect circle.  The blacksmith supplies a
big hoop of an iron tire precisely matched to the distance around the
fellies.  The wheelwright heats the tire, which expands just enough to be
coaxed on with a heavy hammer.  He then doused the wheel with water so
that the tire shrinks to bind the assembly.

Admission is charged and it is deemed a great entertainment as well as
giving people some idea of who the next rising talent is in the legal
world.

      <roomdescription>The library is a glorious room, its wood-panelled walls and oaken shelves
polished to a fine shine.  On the few square feet where there is no
horizontal surface to lay a book or a map on, one small area of wall,
there is a tapestry showing a court scene.  Several men are in the docks
awaiting judgement.  Underneath the tapestry is the faded legend, &quot;The
Trial of th.  &quot; Whose trial it was is long forgotten, even the inscription
now illegible past the first three words.  No books of adventure or
romance will you find here, no novels of mystery or tales of the One
Power.  Instead, every tiny alcove, each pigeon hole and shelf is crammed
with maps, property deeds and books of laws both old and recent.  The
Court Library is an archive of knowledge that is solely concerned with the
government of men and the laws that make it possible.  Few people enter
here and most of those who do feel a deep sense of foreboding.  It is as
if the information carried in these pages hold a weight that could almost
crush a man.  Indeed, the knowledge stored here has often led to the
deaths of men.

houses, with a series of windows flanked by wooden shutters, and plants on

walkways in which the passengers may get off, and be whisked away in the

fisherman and the trader, this is where they earn their money and to the
customer, this is a place to buy food.  Unlike the docks where dozens of
tiny, grubby stalls sell the freshest catch, each counter here is scrubbed
spotless at least twice a day.  The traders here are always willing to
help each other out, sometimes running each others counters if one of them
has to run an errand.  There is a motto that the traders and the fishermen
who stock the market are fond of saying, &quot;If it's fish you want, you've
come to the right place.  &quot; They boast that there is no fish you could
possibly want that they don't sell.

can get a man killed.  The rough wooden floor is badly stained in more

      <roomdescription>Much like the other 'guest' room, this one is sparsely furnished, dimly
lit and smelling of salt.  The bed is little more than a pallet on a few
rough cut stones, the mattress stuffed with straw.  The pillows, though
once white and plump are now stained a dirty yellow and are flat as
pancakes.  A large chair stands by the foot of the bed, where some patrons
are wont to watch those using the bed.  The floor is covered in mud, the
sailors who frequent the place having dragged it from the docks.  
Evidently the Innkeeper is more concerned with keeping the customers happy
that in providing a clean workplace for his employees.

Dining Hall is more crowded than one would expect.  Few of the people in
here seem to be eating though, perhaps enough of them have seen the
kitchen and no longer have an appetite.  Instead, the patrons are gathered
around the large tables discussing such things as the weather, politics
and the seas.  If the room was cleaned up, something that the Innkeeper
seems a stranger to, it would actually be quiet impressive.  The room is
lit with old, rusty ships lanterns, a masthead is secured to one wall,
angling out to a point along the ceiling's rafters where it is lashed with
wrist-thick ropes.  On the opposite wall the names of ships that have been
lost to the seas have been carved into a huge board which looks to have
been salvaged from an ancient wreck.

      <roomdescription>Possibly the most rat and flea infested building in Mayene, including
outhouses and cesspits, The Blue Fish Tavern is not a place that any
respectable citizen would ever step foot inside.  Yet it does more
business than anyone could imagine possible.  Whatever draws the people,
it is not cleanliness, nor a friendly Innkeeper.  The alcohol served here
is renowned for it's ability to melt copper and to kill a horse, yet
people still drink it.  Some of the men who come here try their luck at
stones or cards, but most are looking for a few hours with the Innkeeper's
'Daughters'.  The building itself is mostly built of sandstone or some
similar cheap stone, many of the blocks crumbling under the weight of the
ivy that crawls all over the outside of the inn and indeed over some of
the inner walls too.  Badly lit, badly run and badly maintained, it's no
wonder that the patrons of the Blue Fish are badly tempered.

    <roombasic title="The Sun Hawk" vnum="9279" zone="90">
      <roomdescription>This is a favourite pub among the Mayeners.  They come here to relax and
have a pint of honey-brown ale.  The floor is made of wooden planks from
an old ship called the Sun Hawk.  Along the west wall lovers have carved
their names.  There is a dart game along the east wall.  Numerous wooden
tables and chairs are scattered throughout the establishment.  In the
center of the room is a great fire-pit with a screen around it.  The
windows are made of sheets of mica, but over them on the inside are frames
covered in silk of dazzling colours.  When the sun shines in the room it
spills soft colour everywhere lifting the gloomiest mood.  On the tables
are brass oil lamps shaped like the Sun Hawk.  The barrel-vaulted ceiling
is painted white and has exposed beams curving across it.  Little walls
jut out here and there creating little pockets of privacy.  Above the
entrance is mounted the great steering wheel of the Sun Hawk.  On the
south wall hangs the great prow that is a carved hawk with outstretched
wings overlaid with brass.

      <roomdescription>After travelling quiet a distance through the city of Mayene, the several
boats that offer passage along the canal all take their passengers right
here, to the end of the canal.  Most offer a return trip for a little
extra money.  There are some small barges that load goods here and offer
their services as transports to the many businesses that thrive alongside
the Berona Canal.

stressful air about it, the bustle of activity less pressing than that of
the higher docks.  As the dock extends out onto the water, there are
several ships tied up along either side, barefooted dockhands continuously
offloading goods from any one of the ships.  The smell of salt pervades
the entire area, and the cries of gulls are constant, the actual birds
themselves landing on the ships, the dock itself, and generally where they
should not.

      <roomdescription>The air within this area is heavily laden with the salty scent of the
ocean, the ship rocks steadily with each wave against its sides.  Great
care has been taken in the maintenance of this vessel, its decks worn
smooth by working feet, the wood is freshly scrubbed and swabbed.  The
sides of the ship are framed with carved, wooden railings, though what
engravings had decorated the wood have long disappeared, eroded by the
wind, salt and sea, so that only a semblance of the former image remains.
Men aboard the craft, tend to their duties, tightening ropes and checking
knots, its sails now bundled tightly to yards and masts, at port as it is.
Along the great mast of the ship is tied a rope ladder, leading to the
crow's nest high above, upon which is fixed the ship's standard, marking
it as Mayene's very own.

      <roomdescription>The sharp smell of tar and pitch can be smelled drifting within the air,
blending well with the heavy salt that lingers perpetually near the ocean.
The decks, scrubbed and swabbed, seem to roll with every rough wave
crashing upon the ship's hull, though the sailors aboard are quite used to
the movement, handling themselves naturally as they tend to their various
chores; making fast the riggings and swabbing the last corners of the
deck.  A carved railing lines the right side of the ship, over which can
be seen the restless waves of the ocean, the vessel's hull caulked with
the tar and pitch that are likely the sources of the smell.  A crow's nest
looms up above, rocking in exaggerated movements with the waves, this
bearing the standards of Mayene.  In the distance, the light of the sun
sparkles over the waves, making the sea seem a beautiful, glittering
emerald.

      <roomdescription>The dock is built of the same kind of weathered, strong wood as the rest.
As usual, there is a sizable contingent of Mayene Winged Guards
surrounding it, and several ships with the look of being oil ships
anchored next to it.  Aside from the guards are the usual barefooted
dockhands, offloading barrels from the anchored ships, which are then
quickly taken away.  In addition to the presence of the Wing Guard, dock
guards also oversee the process of loading and unloading the ships, not
just of cargo but its human passengers as well given that this is a main
point of entry into Mayene from Tear.  The guards frequently check the
papers of passengers.  To the west is anchored the ship 'Wave Hawk', her
smooth hull painted a dark green color, her sails a dirty white.  Several
crew members can be seen moving about on the deck, appearing to be
preparing it for something.

      <roomdescription>Shaded by the main sail, the bow is a good fifteen feet across at its
widest, tapering down to where both sides meet, and the ship begins.  
Coils of rope are stacked along one side, ropes from the various sails
tied down on either side as well.  Bare chest and barefoot sailors are
usually moving around, several up in the mass of rope attached to the main
mast, several more tightening or loosening the ropes tied down, and then
usually a more senior sailor overseeing them all.  There is an air of
efficiency about the ship and the crew, the solid, weathered wood of the
deck as clean as it could be expected.

a busy place.  Valerna Road heads westward until finally turning south

Almost always crowded with traffic heading in either direction, the
Intersection is no place for the slow-footed or the slow-witted.  Cries of
pain are often heard as man or beast finds out how heavy a cart or wagon
can be, by the simple method of getting caught under a large wheel.

painted a very dark blue.  There are no windows facing the street though
the second floor has several windows with vertical bars across them and
flanked by shutters.  A sign hangs from the building indicating this is a
school of fencing.  Upon the door is a large brass knocker in the shape of
crossed swords.  There are wrought iron hitching posts shaped like horse

portal with a round window set over it.  The door is of carved cypress, a
gift from a very talented wood carver named Taurien, in an unsuccessful
bid for the goldsmith's oldest daughter, Dysielle.  A gold-braided bell
rope beside the door rings a sweet peal of bells to summon the goldsmith

hanging around the rim.  The school is a large building with a vaulting
ceiling.  Along the western wall are many arched doorways that open onto
the school's courtyard during most classes.  It is rumoured that it is at
night when the secret techniques are taught to the most promising
students.  Along the northern wall are wooden lockers where students store
their equipment.  The spiral staircase leads upstairs to the Master's
office and private quarters.

The goldsmiths, their apprentices and assistants work here producing every
sort of gold beaten object.  The southern workshop is where the gold is
cast.  Here are small furnaces used to melt down gold ingots.  The liquid
metal is then poured into molds and cast into solid or hollow objects,
such as statuettes, candlesticks, rings and other ornaments.  The eastern
workshop houses related crafts and accommodates the gold and silversmiths
who plate and enamel objects for decoration.  Each of these workshops
contain the tools necessary for its specific tasks.  The western workshop
isn't a workshop but a storage area for raw materials as well as the
precious metals they work.  Stored here on shelves are the finished items
that assistants will tag and bring down to the shop.

there horse dung mares the vista and pleasant scent of the flowers, but
not for long as the road workers are forever busy cleaning.  Both sides of

Atop the oil lamps are perched brass hawks, like sentinels of the city.

      <roomdescription>The walls of this shop are almost completely covered in shelves containing
dozens of bottles with different-colored bottles on them.  The most
prevalent color seems to be black, and in fact two entire walls are filled
with nothing but raven-colored containers.  The other two walls contain a
rather haphazard mix of dull-colored vials and flasks.  Each container of
ink has a small piece of parchment tied to it with a piece of twine on
which is written a number and a price.  In the center along the far wall
is a counter with a parchment and pen on it, both attached to the
countertop with twine and nails.  The parchment has several
different-colored marks on it, and the pen appears worn and used.  Behind
the counter are a closed door and a few low shelves with some brightly
colored bottles and vials on them.  The rug on the wooden floor is so
covered in ink stains and blemishes that it is difficult to discern what
was the original colour.

      <roomdescription>A desk and chair sit off to one corner of the room next to a window with a
grand view of the streets outside.  The window drapes are a soft pale
yellow, and are adorned with small, embroidered flowers near the edge.  
The desk itself is littered with papers, yet just enough of the wood shows
to reveal the fine grains of oak, and a few delicate patterns trace across
the legs.  The chair has a very small back, and it appears very
uncomfortable.  On the far wall is a very large wooden bed made of oak.  
Intricate designs are worked into it, and they seem to make the eye dizzy.
The blankets are soft white wool, and the pillows are soft as air.  The
walls of the room are decorated with tapestries, and a few inkbottles are
found lying under the desk.  A wooden room divider sits in the center of
the room, marking off the bed area from the writing area.  A few oil lamps
decorate the walls, brining in a fairly warm light to the room.

Some are written upon, some are waiting for words to be scrawled upon

from the palace library.  Upon the desks are finely-blown glass ink
bottles, with corks on the tops.  A boy sits in a corner and sharpens
quills.  To the north is a wonderful performance hall, often frequented by
musicians and gleemen.  To the south is a modest library of books of the
Palace of Mayene.

      <roomdescription>The barn is dominated by a massive wheel located at thefar end.  It is
sunk beneath the floor level as are a number of rectangular pits in the
room.  The wheel is wide enough for a sturdy horse to get within it and
walk around to turn the wheel.  In turning, it rotates a great axle
running half the length of the room.  Beside the pits there are
peg-toothed wheels on the axle which may be used to turn cogwheels which
move saws to and from through off-centered rods connected to them.  The
saws in the saw pits are thus driven with much greater force than men
alone could muster, and many tasks are made easier such as the cutting of
timer for boards, doors, floors, etc.  Wood is brought to the rear of the
building and quickly reduced to the exact size desired.

ditch as well as numerous wildflowers and small trees.  Not only is it
clean, but in the spring time its full of colours from all the blooms and
blossoms as well as filled with a fragrant scent.  Oil lamps provide light
at night in order to dissuade Tairen spies and assassins, and keep Mayene
as safe a place as possible.  There is a wrought-iron bench for weary
shoppers and travelers to take a rest before continuing onward.  Traffic
is not as heavy in Mayene a it is in some other countries partly because
Mayene is small and partly because they are careful about who they let
into the city.

      <roomdescription>Old oak and beechwood barrels line up along the wall behind the bar.  
Each barrel has a brass spigot for dispensing beer and various ales.  The
bar is polished mahogany with a top made of granite.  The top is chipped,
cracked and stained in places.  All along the bar are bar stools and the
bar has a brass rod to rest your feet.  A number of dark wood tables and
chairs are scattered about the room.  There isn't much light except from
the candles on the tables.  In the winter, iron pots of coal are set along
the wall to keep the room moderately warm.  The tavern's old dog likes to
sleep under the tables and even the occasional fight doesn't seem to
bother him.

      <roomdescription>This is a very large hall with numerous serving girls though there is one
that is obviously in charge of the lot of them.  The flooring is made of
cypress planks gotten from the Drowned Lands to the north.  The walls are
made of cedar that gives the room a nice scent.  The room is circular and
the ceiling is some eighteen feet high and is painted like under the sea
with all sorts of fish and marine life.  Along the south wall is a great
tank of water where they keep a few fish.  When a customer orders one they
fish it out and cook it up fresh.  It's a rather rustic atmosphere, but
they are rumored to serve some of the best food in all Mayene.  There is a
great fireplace on the eastern wall and a serving counter on the north
wall.  Along the north wall is where the beer, ale and wines are stored.
Draped at odd angles from the ceiling to the floor are fishing nets with
their iron sinkers and wooden floaters.

      <roomdescription>The entrance to the old Captain's Tavern is quite spacious.  The front
door is usually thick with old ship lanterns flanking each side of the
door.  Old plank flooring has seen a lot of wear though the staff does
their best to keep it clean.  There are round windows trimmed in polished
brass just like on a ship that are evenly spaced across the southern wall.
The windows are paned with polished horn.  There is a strange plant that
grows under the windows.  Some say the old captain dug it out of the swamp
and others say he brought it back from some far away place.  No one knows
for sure since the old captain never told and is now in the hand of the
Creator with his niece now running the tavern.  Its an odd plant because
it snaps at some people an has been known to sting a few people.  There is
a great wooden counter upon, which lies a sign-in book to register all the
guests.  Behind the counter are all the room keys.

      <roomdescription>Tabac smoke from the patron's pipes fills the aire.  The plank flooring
creaks, even the lightest person walks across it.  There are no serving
girls here to distract the gamblers, but the owner keeps the kegs and
pitchers of ale flowing.  Numerous wooden tables are setup for card
playing.  There are also several dicing tables that always have a cluster
of people around them.  A small bar is set up along the north wall stocked
with kegs of beer, ale and wine.  In one corner there is always a game of
chess being played and in another corner is a game of stones.  The clink
of coins is an almost constant music.  Some fighting breaks out, but it is
usually a pretty orderly place.  The walls are extra thick which keeps the
sounds from this room away from the ears of the rest of the tavern.

and sunny room a feeling of the shore.  The carved mahogany bed is covered
with a fluffy down comforter and a mosaic tile fireplace hearth gives the
room its final colorful touch.  There is a couple of wooden chairs and a
washstand near the bed.  The wooden floor has a bleached white look about
it, almost like sand.  Near the door is a small table with an oil lamp
upon it similar to the lamps used in ships.  Upon the wall is a map of the
seas, but given Mayene's well known secretiveness regarding the oilshoals,
it is doubtful that this map would be an accurate rendition of the seas.

massive forge surrounded by racks of tools, cooling troughs and smelting
crucibles dominate the far wall of this work area and produces an
inordinate amount of dry heat.  The stone workbenches are much pitted and
scarred from years of use.  The tools and implements of the armour's
trade, each with its own highly specific use, hang from the stone walls.
There are anvils of different sizes and shapes for detail work.  Large
barrels filled with water are present for cooling and tempering the
metals.  Several large shelves hold the metals used in the making of
armours and weapons.  There are also a number of lanterns and torches to
better illuminate the work area.  Besides the door is a large bin of
coals, charcoals and wood; supplying different fuels for the different
temperatures needed.

that make a variety of wonderful colours.  There are reds, greens, blues,
purples, oranges, yellows, browns, greys, blacks and all sorts of
interesting colours in between.  Once the dye Mistress has approved of the
colour then her assistants proceed to dye wool, yarns, threads and
fabrics.  Most of the vats have to be heated and the wood boys keep the
fires fed while a group of older boys chop the trees and haul in cartloads
of it to the shop.  Great paddles are used to stir the contents being dyed
in the vats to make sure they get an even colouring.  Then they are
removed, rinsed, gently wrung, and then laid out or hung to dry.  The
press woman makes sure the cloth is ironed and wrinkle-free as possible
once the fabric is dried.  The thread is wrapped around wooden spools and
the yarn is wrapped around wooden cards.  The dyed fleece is wrapped up in
brown paper and tied with string.  Once a week their hard work is sold to
various shops around Mayene.

      <roomdescription>Once the sheep have been sheared, their wool is taken here and it is
washed to rid it of dirt.  There are great wash tubs for the washing of
the wool.  Water boys constantly are hauling needed water and dumping the
dirty water when needed.  The wool is then laid out on drying racks in the
sun.  Once dried the wool is then carded by the hands of the wool carders
using wooden paddles with fine wire teeth on one side.  Once carded some
of the wool is then ready to be dyed and is taken to the great dye vats.
Some is not dyed but in the end both have to be spun into skeins of
twisted yarn and thread.  This is one on great spinning wheels by the
spinners.

side where the sheep stay until they are sheared.  The sheep's legs are
tied together and they are laid down on the floor, then the Shearer uses
the shears to chop off the fleece.  The fleece is then put in a large
basket and taken to the wool carding and washing shed.  Some farmers pay
to have their sheep sheared for them and others give twenty percent of the
wool that is sheared as payment.  After the sheep have been sheared they
are returned to the farmer or if they belong to the shop then they are
taken out of Mayene through the west gate into the pastures.  All of the
shop's sheep are tattooed with an X with a half moon under the X.

various benches.  The Stone Cutter helpers eagerly keep the floor swept
chasing dirt outside and gathering up the small chips of stone.  Some of
the chips are large enough that the helpers can sell them to the toy maker
who makes marbles from the odd pieces.  Apprentices and journeymen to the
Master Stone Cutter do much of the work while the Master conducts business
and draws up plans for the work that they do in the shop.  It is a busy
place and one can hear the steady ring of hammer and chisel striking stone
once the day begins.

      <roomdescription>Upon entering the kitchen, the smells of the day's meals drift through the
air.  From a shelf above a large oven, racks of bread baked earlier in the
day cool in preparation for slicing.  In an enclave on the western wall,
two large spitfires stand, dogs tied to each.  Pots and pans are arranged
hanging above a counter in the middle of the large room, with spoons and
ladles dangling to one side.  A few hooks are empty, obviously meant for
the cookware in use on the stove, where a stew bubbles merrily.  Servants
bustle about helping the cook, who stands about giving orders in
preparation for the next meal.  It seems that no matter what the time of
day, something is always being prepared, whether it be a stew or porridge
or soup for some late night or early morning order to the kitchen.  A
double door on the northern wall swings open into the dining room.  To the
east, a smaller door, split in the middle to allow the top of the door to
remain open, leads to the garden.  The southern wall frames a door which
leads into the stables, split like the garden door, but typically closed
to keep the smells from the stables from mixing with the scents of the
kitchen.

      <roomdescription>Three wheels dominate the potter's workshop where the clay can be thrown
into artistic shapes forming bowls, vases, and various other vessels.  
One side of the room is devoted to slip casting.  A thick suspension of a
claybody in water is poured into the working mold.  The plaster is porous
so it absorbs water, and in the process deposits a layer of clay on the
inner surface of the mold.  Multiple molds are usually poured at the same
time and are worked as a group for timing purposes.  When the piece is the
desired thickness, which is based mainly on the time the clay slurry is in
the mold, the excess liquid slurry is poured out.  The pieces are then
dried for a while and then the piece is removed from the mold while still
damp but firm.  Any mold lines where multipiece molds were joined are
trimmed off flush with a knife, and the piece is smoothed with a sponge.
Besides the master potter and the assistants there are water boys who haul
in the needed water and the mold cleaners who clean up the slips molds and
set them out to dry.

Everywhere there are woven baskets full of threads and yarns and wooden

      <roomdescription>Unlike many butcher shops, the owner keeps this one very clean.  There is
a display counter with the various cuts of meat.  Whatever is not sold is
salted down or goes to the smokehouse as it can be better preserved.  The
butcher's assistants are always busy skinning some animal or cutting it
into sellable pieces or dressing the meat in various ways.  Here can be
found selections of beef, venison, pork, poultry, and mutton.  There are a
couple of wooden chairs for those who have to wait for their choice cuts.
The floor is made of stones and at least twice a day the floor is washed
to remove blood and bits of meat that might have fallen.  The shop has a
small window that displays the freshest and most popular cuts of meat.  
There is a ball attached to the door that lets the butcher know when a
customer has arrived

standing atop block bases of marble on all sides of the structure.  
Two gilded hawks guard the entrance.  Brightly colored flowers border
all around the mausoleum.  The structure once entered is open on all
sides except for a northern wall.  A curved marble bench accented
with scrolls forms a semi- circle on both sides for visitors to sit
upon.  Below the marble seating are entombed some of the less known
family members, their names carved along the back of the marble
seating.  In the center burns the eternal flame atop a golden orb.  
Against the northern wall trickles a fountain from the open beak of a
gilded hawk formed as if frozen in a single cry in remembrance of
those who lie buried here.  On the side of the northern wall lies a
marble stair that leads down.

      <roomdescription>The garden swing is carved each year by some noted Mayene carpenter in a
contest of wood artistry between the best just before the onset of spring.
The swing is always big enough for two and the ropes are entwined with
garland.  Some years the swing even has a carved back.  It is always hung
from the great oak and one can swing very high.  Every year, someone
usually falls and gets an arm or leg broken or more rarely, they might
die.  It would not be uncommon in the spring to find lines of people
waiting for a turn at the swing.  To the side is a water basin filled with
fresh water to provide a drink for the visitors.

    <roombasic title="The Garden Fountain" vnum="9475" zone="90">
      <roomdescription>A splashing fountain made of pink marble is the crowning piece of the
entire garden.  Its five tiers of basins are all shaped like scalloped
shells.  The very top is a carved fish from whose mouth the water begins
its flow.  It's an ingenious construction involving the damming up if a
small stream that flows behind the fountain.  The water is then drained
off from the fountain using terra cotta pipes which helps to water the
rest of the garden.  The water in the fountain undergoes a colour change
every month of the year so all one need do is look at the colour of the
water to know what is the current month.

      <roomdescription>Planted here are many trees such as cypress, magnolia, chestnuts,
wisteria, etc.  A few are just perfect for climbing and are a delight to
both children and adults.  The center of attention is a great oak that
some say is the oldest tree in Mayene.  Besides being a wonderful climbing
tree, it also has a tree house built among its branches.  Another
interesting feature of this section of the garden is an area called bird
city.  Every summer a small number of children are invited to assist the
garden carpenter in the construction of a new bird house which is quite
elaborate and takes most of the summer to construct.  Once completed it is
placed on a wooden column among the many other bird houses each
constructed and painted differently.  Many birds take advantage of bird
city for the building of their nests.  This is also a most wonderful place
for birdwatchers.

up in the treehouse the view of the city is breathtaking toward the south
and toward the north is a great expanse of land which can be seen from the
windows.  The garden carpenter has taken care to construct a sound
treehouse that will accommodate many children for many years of use as
well as adults.  The ceiling is high enough that any adult or even ogier
could stand in it.  Along one wall are built in benches for sitting.  A
table hinged on another wall can be lifted up and the legs folded down for
use.  There are also built in shelves with closed cabinets at the bottom
and even a small closet for storage.  On the final wall is a wooden bunk
bed that rises to accommodate six platforms upon which a child can bring
his bedding and set up for the night.  Next to the table is a door that
leads south.

maze.  At the center of the maze lies a great white, flowering dogwood
tree that has numerous cracks and crevices in its trunk.  It is here that

of the branches hang wind chimes whose soft voice can be heard throughout
the garden but is little help in aiding those to the center of the hedge
maze.  It is so complex that often the gardeners have to rescue some lost
visitor from the maze.

rounded rooms and gentle sloping roofs.  The library does not hold as many
treasures as some of the larger cities, but it is a nice collection of
books, scrolls, notes, etched tablets, painted bark, engravings and woven
text.  The collection grows by donations, the labor of scribes and
acquisitions by the First of Mayene.  Sometimes, volumes are lost through
accidents, fire and the fingers of age which corrupt with mold, pests,
dust and dryness.  Much of the library work is concerned with the
preservation and restoration of the oldest works, many of which are mere
fragments of their original work.

      <roomdescription>Square, round, and oblong, woven white-oak baskets are as useful as they
are simple, beautiful, and strong.  Basket making requires an ax, a few
wedges, a large knife, and a supply of saplings.  Baskets are made of ash,
hickory, cedar, and reeds.  Willow branches--called sallows if the bark
was left and osiers if it was stripped--are popular.  But Mayeners prefer
the tough and supple white oak for its tractability and its clear,
perfect, straight grain.  The basket maker starts with green, six-foot
sections of ten inch diameter logs and split them into sixteenths.  The
reddish heartwood is saved for basket handles.  Slicing along the growth
rings, the knife peels away long flexible, wooden ribbons.  The weaving
and plaiting required more nimbleness than strength.  The basket maker's
assistant does his best to keep the floor swept.
