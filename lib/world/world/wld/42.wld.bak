      <roomdescription>Upon entering this small and dark room, only a few details give away that
it is used in some way or another.  The two small beds have been shoved
into the room, giving it a very cramped feel with the small desk and a
couple of stools.  The spread of the beds are discolored from their
numerous years of being stuffed away as even the lace hasn't been restored
to its natural white.  The curtains that only grace the outer edges of the
window frame are the same color and the wood itself looks as if it is
about to fall into dust.  The personal items only number a few and are
strewn about.  There is a cloak hanging from a peg that has seen better
days, but looks to be a personal item.  There is one half used candle on
the desk and a neat pile of parchment at its edge.  There are wrinkles in
the spread of the bed, intentional or not.  The view isn't the best, a
scene showing a bunch of girls in white turning laundry is buckets of
already dirty water.

      <roomdescription>The moment the door to this room swings open, the visitor is greeted by
the warm invitation of a subtle incense, beckoning a welcome and alluring
the senses.  The internal area is lit by several wall &amp;rs&amp;Rc&amp;yo&amp;Yn&amp;yc&amp;Re&amp;rs&amp;n, scattered
throughout the room, and fashioned in the form of golden hawks in
midflight.  There is also a hawk on the floor of the room, stitched onto
an ornate rug in Shienaran fashion, so that it appears lifted directly out
of the nation's flag and placed onto a field of deep &amp;Kblack&amp;n.  The bird's
detail is flawlessly brought to life in &amp;ys&amp;Kh&amp;wa&amp;yd&amp;Ke&amp;wd &amp;yc&amp;Ko&amp;wl&amp;yo&amp;Kr&amp;ws&amp;n and perfect
proportion, and appears rather opposite to the small tabby cat that can
usually be found stretched out upon it.  Natural light floods the room
from a pair of glass windows, which look to lead onto a thick forest tree
line, and are draped in lengths of &amp;Wp&amp;wal&amp;We &amp;Wl&amp;wine&amp;Wn&amp;n curtains.  The rest of the
room is simply decorated, bearing candles atop the surfaces of an armoire,
desk, and bookshelves that all seem to match each other, and there are
also chairs beside a comfortable looking couch.  A large fireplace breaks
one wall, and it's mantle is decorated only with candles and a small
dagger in the very center, their images all reflected in a great mirror
overtop the &amp;Kh&amp;re&amp;ka&amp;Kr&amp;rt&amp;Kh&amp;n.  The most detailed aspect, however, of this room is
the web of warding that surrounds it, for the eyes that can detect such
things, of course...

      <roomdescription>Upon entering the room, one is greeted with the sight of a four poster bed
draped with a &amp;clight blue&amp;n comforter and an assortment of &amp;Ksi&amp;wlv&amp;Ker&amp;n and &amp;cblue&amp;n
pillows taking up nearly the entire northern wall.  A simple oak writing
table is positioned against the south wall, an elegant candy box decorated
with &amp;Km&amp;wi&amp;Kr&amp;wr&amp;Ko&amp;wr&amp;Ks&amp;n on a platinum base, various writing supplies, and a glass
vase holding &amp;Yyellow&amp;n roses arranged on the desktop.  A vanity table adorned
with a &amp;Ksi&amp;wlv&amp;Ker&amp;n plated brush, comb, and mirror rests in the southwest corner
of the room.  Two plain chairs with cushions in tones of &amp;bblue&amp;n are placed
near the center of the west wall in front of a small window, a beautiful
rug with twisting &amp;ggreen&amp;n vines and &amp;Yyellow&amp;n roses on a background of &amp;bblue&amp;n
covering the wooden floor.
