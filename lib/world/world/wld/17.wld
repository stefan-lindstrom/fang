      <roomdescription>Neat rows of wooden houses come into view.  The sounds of people
bustling about and chickens squawking indicate that this small
village is still a bustling center of life for its occupants.  It is
almost as if this village is untouched by the turning of the Wheel.
But nothing is, in fact, it appears as though there is now a newly
built wall surrounding the village.  The wall evident as one approaches
the northern gate, also a new addition.  Foreboding as the wall may be,
the gate is left open and unmanned for now, a welcome sight.  Far off
in the distance, a trickling of water can be heard.  Perhaps there is a
pond nearby?

      <roomdescription>\c00The street almost suddenly narrows here, the stones dotted along it's
edges moving closer together, getting a cart along this way could be
a little difficult, and there are no real visible wheel tracks so most likely
there's never a call for a cart to come this way.

over the small rock lines on the edges, the air seems fresh here as well
as if the spring rain has just fallen, although likely it hasn't rained for
months in Deven Ride, just as in most of the other lands.  As the path
reaches along more, the village green comes into sight.

      <roomdescription>A roughly circular grassy expanse lies in the center of Deven Ride.  Here
festivals are held, casual gossip shared, and games are played.  Occasionally,
villagers will even let their animals graze here.  The green plays an important
social role, bringing the villagers together, in both good times and bad.  At
the head of the green lies the only village inn.  To the west lies the pond.

village green is off to the southeast where town festivals and dancing
take place.  The green is quiet presently, but come Winternight, the eve
of Bel Tine, that area will be thriving with activity.  The green hosts all
manner of town rituals and ceremonies, from marriages to the Woman's
circle gatherings, it's indeed a sacred and special spot.  Past the green
to the north a bit is the town's largest inn.  Streets travel along here
this being a central area of Deven Ride.

      <roomdescription>Deven Ride is a village that consists of neat rows of wooden houses.  It is
hard to imagine that months ago Whitecloaks had flooded the city with their
tents and camps, placing this little village under martial rule.  All for one
supposed Darkfriend.  It is amazing how one person can turn a village upside
down.  But they claim this Perrin Goldeneyes is ta'veren.  Deven Riders cares
not either way.  The Whitecloaks are gone, and their village has been restored
to them.

dirt road thinning a little as it is followed further to the north.  Despite
the relenting tree cover, the sounds of wilderness, birds calling, rustling
leaves and the like are still predominate.  To the south in the distance
can be heard the ring of a blacksmith's hammer on an anvil, and the
low moans of farm animals as well.  Yes indeed, Emond's Field nears.

with the other neat path within the village.  The paths are lined with
bits of pebble along this edge of the path, further enhancing the sense of

well traveled.

      <roomdescription>When there is even the smallest possibility that the day will be clear,
the laundry lines are hung.  Clean shirts, pants, skirts and dresses fly
about in the breeze.  The sweet smell of soap and sun mingle pleasantly in
the air.  A goodwife stands in the backyard of her house, pinning the
clothes carefully so that they won't fall unto the ground and get muddy
and dirty.  Doing laundry twice is a rather irksome task.  The backyard of
the house is visible down this pathway, penned in by low stone walls, the
house itself is a small cottage of sorts, one story high with a thatched
roof.  On the opposite side of the stone wall is a curing pen and just
before that, another small stone pen where sheep bleat off and on, when
they're not grazing.

rug that flaps in the wind to your left.

      <roomdescription>If you are not a resident of Deven Ride, you will perhaps not realize how much
the village has changed.  The new houses are apparent, since the wood and
thatch are both quite fresh.  However, it is the mix of faces and clothing that
would astonish anyone, even the merchants that stop by each year for harvest.
Domani, Tairen, and Illian dresses, hair and beards can be seen everywhere, on
outsiders and locals.  Amazing, startling changes.

      <roomdescription>This change in Two Rivers was inevitable.  Although the river and mountains
seemed insurmountable, it is amazing what a little political turmoil can do to
people's understanding of the word impossible.  They have come over the
mountains, so desperate for their lives.  How could the Two River folk not
appreciate this fact?  Even if their ways are different, their clothing
shocking and revealing, there is respect for the perseverance of these
immigrants.    
Stones line the street here, the path disappearing behind, the earth hard
packed and well traveled, marked by much use.  Wagon tracks rut the
road and horse tracks meander through the dirt.  To each side of the
street country houses sit, yards penned with low stone walls.  In the
distance the sounds of nature mingle with the playful cries of children.

as it reaches onward.  Off to the left can be seen a stoney faced man
with a large leather apron draped over the front of him, working away
in a blacksmith's forge, the fires hot as he bangs on a red-hot item
in the coals and works the flume.  Beside this hard working individual is
large black anvil, a few dirtied rags dropped upon it.  A couple paces from
that, a large wooden rack displaying items previously forged, brackets,
buckles, belt knives, horse shoes even an oiled short sword.

more traveled in nature.  To each side of the near-street are houses
dotted along.  Each house penned in a low stone wall, each one a low

families running the daily chores, feeding chickens, fetching water from
the well and the like.  In a sort of V-intersection the pathway ends,
the previously traveled path angling along to the north and to
the southwest a similar path stretches on, to the west, the pathway
begins to widen noticeably, resembling a street.

It seems as though the townsfolk are always in the midst of work or
play and neither activity is embraced less than the other.  To the right
behind one of the many houses lining the street can be seen a young

the boy's father off in the distance carries a large staff and tosses feed
onto the ground from a bucket in his opposite hand for a group of

beyond it theres access to the Village Green not too far off and just
a skip from there can be found the village's inn, The Goose and Pipe, off
to the southeast a bit.  As it is, the street being travelled on currently
is a bustle with peddlers and hawkers, something the people of Deven
Ride have only recently become accustomed to.  Foriegners stride
through as well, marked by their contrasting clothing styles and colors
not to mention their jewelery or hairstyles.

this part of the village is closer to the river, parents
are wary of living so close to its fast currents. Children
have been tempted many a time to wade in its seemingly placid
depths. However, the river is still a ways off, so parents need
only be stern with their children.

There must be a beehive in the area of that house.  Perhaps

white boxes, and yes, more bees swarm around them lazily.

brandy.  Home brew only.  Master al'Nerin makes his own, strong enough to bring
a tear into even the burliest farmer's eyes.  There is also some wine and
whiskey, since the Goose and Pipe Inn must maintain its pride as the largest

other hallway's.  But it is still much safer and cleaner by 
anyone's standards than the hallways of inns elsewhere.  
Just leave Two Rivers, and it will all be quite clear.

      <roomdescription>The room is even smaller than the ones on the floor below, but it is still
adequate for most travelers' needs.  The al'Nerins never cut corners on any of
their rooms.  It benefits neither the travelers nor them.  What are a few
coppers if it keeps customers coming and happy?  Plus, the al'Nerins are a good
and honest folk who provide the service happily and competently.

      <roomdescription>The room is a small corner room.  Its advantage is the dormer window that lets
in the wan rays of light early in the morning and the twinklings of the stars
late at night.  The bed has been positioned perfectly for peering out of the
window.  This is a good place to tend to a sick person.  If you don't mind
having to run up and down the stairs to fetch them anything, that is.

shelves, housing meticulously labelled bins, some with pictures that display the
contents of the bins.  The teas in the shop range from exotic fruits and herbs
from far away lands that the people of Deven Ride only read of, or perhaps
dream about.  In the back of the shop is a long wooden counter.  A young woman
leans against it, her chin resting in her cupped palms as she stares into the
empty space.  Behind her are various copper kettles with interesting smells
wafting from their spouts.

little dimple at them, and silently pointing out the blooms she knows to be the
best in the store.

A wrinkled and brown man stands behind the counter, humming softly

to himself, as if in deep thought while he prepares and arranges
various jars and pots of sweets and honey for sale.

sweet and savory baked goods. A young girl, perhaps Cila's
daughter, takes the orders and coins from the customers.

in fact is a very respectable venue in which one may purchase
fine liquors. Generally brandy, but the locals dabble in
wine making and cider pressings. The young man behind
the counter does not look as if he has had much experience,
but perhaps he comes from a long line of spirit sellers. That is
likely the case.

      <roomdescription>After travelling the Old Road for what seemed like aeons, the small
village of Deven Ride manifests before you, it's newly built wooden
walls parted by a large wooden gate where the Old Road diminishes
into an inner street.  Through the gate can be seen many a busy
townsperson, going about their modest business.  The muted sounds
of animals can be heard as well, mingled with the soft buzz of
conversing townsfolk.  The walls seem to stretch around the entire
village.  This a definite change, a moderately fortified village in this back
water land?  Travelling further will reveal the fortifications as but a scratch
on the surface compared to all the other changes Deven Ride has
undergone.

coming from a collection of pots and bundles of herbs stored on shelves
on the north wall.  A small &amp;Rf&amp;ri&amp;Rr&amp;re&amp;Rp&amp;rl&amp;Ra&amp;rc&amp;Re&amp;n illuminates the room with a soft
flickering &amp;Ylight&amp;n.  Several small windows give a view of a nice garden full
with &amp;yh&amp;Ke&amp;yr&amp;Kb&amp;ys&amp;n on the east side of the cottage.

In a corner stands a large chest filled with old clothes bearing an emblem
of some sort.  Hanging above the chest is a scabbard with a slightly
curved steel sword with the same emblem showing on the hilt.

A quaterstaff with steel endings is leaning against a sturdy table with
some rather ornate padded chairs filling the room.

street, a small white bird painted on the sign hanging over the front
door, it boasts the efficiency of town postmaster.  The front door in
fact is wide open, welcoming anyone who may need to send or mail
something inside.  Behind this almost shack of a structure is a modest
pigeon coop.  Inside the postmaster strides back and forth performing
whatever it is he's been demanded of this day.  Bundles of packaging
sit before a counter, above which, atop the counter, sits a rack with many
individual shelves for letter sorting, most of them empty.  Though the
postmaster is well prepared, it seems his services aren't quite called on
very often, this being Deven Ride after all, a small town, far away from
everything.

Taraboner there, a Saldaean with his bushy mustache and long, almost
beak-like nose also striding through.  The new people in Deven Ride bring
new trade and thus there's many shops sprouting up in this area, such
as Domani dress shops or perhaps a Ghealdan alum merchant.  To the
left up a piece is a man trying to convince a native that tiled roofs are the
wave of the future, scorning the stand-by thatching that the native people
of Deven Ride of grown accustomed to and appreciate.  The livliness is
a sight to behold, considering the local.

the pond is preferred by parents with younger children for safety
reasons and parents of older children for other reasons.  But there
are a few trees along this bit of the pond that allow for more
privacy than the other bits of the pond.  So don't look too closely,
you may seem something you weren't meant to see.
