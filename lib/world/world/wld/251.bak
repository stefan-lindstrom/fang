      <roomdescription>The main room of this inn is decorated in as glaring, if not
more, colors than the outside sign was. A bar countertop is
to the west, a polished gleaming dark \c04b\c00l\c04u\c00e. The inn has several
windows looking out onto the street, each arch decorated in
either a \c01r\c00e\c01d\c00 or \c03y\c00e\c03l\c00l\c03o\c00w. The floor of the inn is a polished
\c02g\c00r\c02e\c00e\c02n\c00 stone, rather aged with use. There are scattered tables
and chairs about the room, most of them occupied with customers
that are brighter than the room itself - Seafolk, Taraboners,
Ebou Dari, Murandians, and even a few swarthy looking men from
Illian are all enjoying the local brew or plum brandy of their
choice. Long skirted maids with deep necklines and several
daggers walk between the tables, avoiding the pinches and
comments of the customers.

      <roomdescription>The white walls of the city wall blind you, reflecting light
that shines down on it. Looking northwards, you see a large race
track which you assume to be the Circuit of Heaven. Ebou Dar has
a racetrack outside each gate, and you can make out the edge of
the western racetrack - the Circuit of the Sun - as you look west.
To the south you see a blazing white city, dotted with domed
houses and shops, and canals running through every part of the
city. There are so many squares that you can see below in the
city that you quickly lose count of them. In the center of the
city you see a very large marble statue of a woman pointing to
the south, surrounding by jets of water and a large fountain.
That must be the main square of Ebou Dar, and you see that it
has exits to most of the shops in Ebou Dar, as well as the palace
to the west.

of trouble. As you look to the south, you see the domed and
pear shaped spires of the Royal Palace, striped with various
colors. Further west, beyond the Palace, you see three huge
spires reach toward the city, almost reaching two thirds
of the way to the topmost spire of the castle. That must be
the west gate of Ebou Dar.

edge of the Ebou Dari city wall. The tower, like everything else
in the city, is made of \c07white\c00 stone blocks, polished smooth and
sparkling in the sun. The dome of the tower is a large pointed
white turnip striped with green. There are small arrow slits on
all sides of the tower, some of them wide enough to allow a view
of the city and of the Royal Palace. On each side of the tower, in
the center between many arrow slits, is a small arched stone window
overlooking the northern forests, bay or city as it may be.There
is a ladder reaching towards a trap door in the ceiling and small
stone stairs reach downwards to the first level of the city wall.

you a sight of the \c07Circuit\c00 of \c06H\c00e\c06a\c00v\c06e\c00n, but all you can see of the

two huge marble columns on each side of the gate, each fifteen
paces in length, providing shade for people who are milling about
under the gate. Tower guards stand by on each side of the gate, and
several more look through a wide arch to the south, which is
presummably the Cityguard watch room. Looking upwards, you see a
very large main peaked dome and two smaller, but still large,
peaked domes flanking it. You wonder if there is anyway to reach
the tops of these towers.

      <roomdescription>You enter another cityguard post inside the Ebou Dari city
wall through an eastern door. This room is sparsely furnished,
with several chairs and a table. A large arched window is
at the northern side of the room, and you can see many people
passing through the \c06Three Towers Gate\c00 into and out of
the city. There is a narrow stone stairwell on the western side
of the room, leading upwards to the city wall.

Palace, and in the center you can see a statue of a woman.
To the north and south you see the other two gates of the city

west you see a large racetrack - the second largest in Ebou Dar
after the Circuit of Heaven - among scattered trees. To the south,
past the Moldine Gate a winding paved road continues south,
where you see a Western Lighttower in the distance.  The Three
Towers gate is directly north.

Ebou Dar's many canals can be seen winding their way through

sparkling in the sun. The dome of the tower is a large pointed
white turnip striped with green. There are small arrow slits on
all sides of the tower, some of them wide enough to allow a view
of the city and of the western forests. On each side of the tower, in
the center between many arrow slits, is a small arched stone window
overlooking the southern forests, palace or city as it may be.There
is a ladder reaching towards a trap door in the ceiling and small
stone stairs reach downwards to the first level of the city wall.

a few boatmen paddling down the canals. To the south the Bay

the Western Lighthouse. The southeastern wall tower is east.

edge of the Ebou Dari city wall. The tower, like everything else
in the city, is made of \c07white\c00 stone blocks, polished smooth and
sparkling in the sun. The dome of the tower is a large pointed
white turnip striped with green. There are small arrow slits on
all sides of the tower, some of them wide enough to allow a view
of the city and of the Royal Palace. On each side of the tower, in
the center between many arrow slits, is a small arched stone window
overlooking the northern forests, bay or city as it may be.There
is a ladder reaching towards a trap door in the ceiling and small
stone stairs reach downwards to the first level of the city wall.

There is a thin layer of water on the bottom of the dingy,

Zithers, harps, tambours, flutes, kettle drums, hammered dulcimers,

even some odd instruments that you cannot identify, but have odd
green metallic scrolls on them, and others have the identifying
trademark of the SeaFolk on them.

the inn's stables to the east. Two small arched windows are on the

cups being upturned can be heard from here, even when the view of
the game is obscured by a crowd of onlookers. The room is filled with
all types of people - a lot of Ebou Dari men stand by dicing, and
some woman are talking at one of the sidetables. A weasly looking
Tairen fellow buries his head in a mug of ale near the dicing tables.

      <roomdescription>The small eastern side door from the grand entryway to the west
leads to the kitchens of the manor - rather small for a manor of
this size, but very well kept and provided. There are several
tables in the center of the room at which maids and cooks alike
peel vegetables, clean freshly caught fish, and season things.
Along the eastern wall are a row of stoves, ovens and fireplaces,
each holding a pot or pan filled with breads, meats, sauces, and
desserts. A small door on the northern end of the room leads
downwards to a cellar.

the Wandering Woman has several rooms set up for visiting Ogier.
Although the visitation of the Builders used to be rather frequent
to this and many other cities, times have changed and many Ogier
no longer leave their steddings. Once every Ogier grove was
protected and cultivated.. Now many groves do not even leave a
single tree, and many have gone wild. The Dark One's touch has
spread over the world, it seems.

manor to the west and the eastern doors of the manor. There are laurel
trees lining the path in the center of the courtyard, and \c07m\c00o\c07r\c00n\c07i\c00n\c07g\c00s\c07t\c00a\c07r\c00

the courtyard to the north, and many birds circle around the southern
birdbath. To the west you see large wrought iron gates, and to the
east you see the manor spread out before you, its domes lined with
\c05r\c00o\c05s\c00e and \c02g\c00r\c02e\c00e\c02n\c00.

northern and western walls, and shelves of books lie between them.
Against the eastern wall is a table bearing parchment, nibbed pens and
several bottles of ink. To the south is the main entryway of the manor,
which is devoid of any furnishings.

is in a small pot that boils over a eastern fire. There are pots and
utensils hung up all over room near the ceiling. A small stone
staircase leads downwards to a cellar near the northern wall.

hay into each. He wears rose and green colored livery, and tight fitting
cream colored pants.

grow gooseberry, cloudberry, duckberry, and redberry bushes. In the

view of the \c06B\c02a\c06y\c00 is breathtaking, and you see the clear blue-green bay

boats, larger netted fishing boats and trading boats from all over

immense spread of water on all sides, so much that it almost makes
you dizzy to look at it. To the north you see the domes and spires

built for stability, you suppose.

see a small arched window along the northern wall. The
window looks onto the countryside south of the city of
Ebou Dar, which gleams a bright white in the northern
distance. To the northeast you see the eastern part of
the Bay of Ebou Dar. Hallways continue in all the other

      <roomdescription>A wide stone paved road leaves the Moldine Gate, which is the
southern entrance to Ebou Dar. As you look upwards, you almost
stagger backwards at the sight of high walls and large domes
spreading upwards as far as the eye can see. Through the gate
to the north you see the square, canals and promenades of the
city. Ebou Dar must truly be the most majestic city that you
have ever seen.
