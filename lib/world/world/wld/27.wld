      <roomdescription>A winding path weaves between the trees and icy rocks to lead down into
the heart of a huge camp.  The fires from this vantage are too numerous to
count, the tents overwhelming with color against the backdrop of &amp;wsnow&amp;n.
&amp;KSm&amp;wo&amp;Kke&amp;n hangs in the air, a smell of warmth and satisfaction. The sprawling
camp covers the hills of the area and slinks between the trees to make a
blur of activity in the distance.

      <roomdescription>A trail leads away from the main path and looks like it is going to lead
around the edge of the northeastern part of the camp. The &amp;Ksm&amp;wo&amp;Kke&amp;n is
heavier here, the distant sound of soldiers laughing now almost heard.  
The &amp;Wsnow&amp;n is deep but there are footprints where scouts or hunters have
wandered through the area looking for game, or people.

      <roomdescription>This trail heads northwest along the outer area of the camp.  The path
is very distinct and it would be hard for one to miss the sure footing
that the well tread road provides.  On one side of the trail is a large
&amp;Kc&amp;wam&amp;Kp&amp;n that is full of activity and the gentle hum of voices while on the
other side is a wilderness almost untouched.  The footfalls are almost
invisible after the fresh &amp;Wsnow&amp;n, the trees glistening wet with the white.

soldiers and Aes Sedai alike.  It is loud, shouts and orders being heard
constantly.  The snow on the ground has been turned to a muddy mixture of
wet &amp;Wsnow&amp;n and &amp;Kdirt&amp;n. The footprints of horses and scouts can be seen making
their way from the camp, off into the snowy cold &amp;Kw&amp;woo&amp;Kds&amp;n ahead of the army.

before it and at the very head of the line.  It would seem as if this is a
place of great importance with the lack of shouts and the sturdy campsites
and steady fires.  The footprints of scouts are more intense and the road
is more &amp;Km&amp;wu&amp;Kd&amp;n than anything.

      <roomdescription>Once the path leads south, it comes upon a gentle slope that heads down
into more tents.  It stays at the edge of the camp so one can only obtain
a passing glance at the people huddling by campfires but the majority of
them still seem to be soldiers. The slope itself is covered in &amp;Wsnow&amp;n,
footprints scarce due to the hazard a snowy hill presents.  The tents and
fires stretch up and over, almost without halting and to both sides of the
slope into the valleys.

attending to matters they do not speak of, men usually following at their

      <roomdescription>In the hustle and bustle of the campsite, it seems as if this one small
area is untouched by feet and wagonwheel.  The snow lies white and pure,
smooth and almost &amp;Wblinding&amp;n. The trees are still covered in heavy wet &amp;Wsnow&amp;n
that has yet to slide from the branches but the &amp;Kdanger&amp;n looms overhead
constantly.  While the voices of the campers can be heard, the smell of
their &amp;Ksm&amp;wo&amp;Kke&amp;n ever present, this one area has been left to nature and it
is quite astonishing.

      <roomdescription>A small game trail runs along the large main trail used to walk through
the campsite. It is small and the footsteps are few, the &amp;Wsnow&amp;n mostly
undisturbed except by the natural critters of the area.  The main trail
can be seen between the &amp;Ktr&amp;yee&amp;Ks&amp;n and looks as if the game trail widens to
permit one to access the trail through the camp, but only slightly.  A
group would have to walk carefully one in front of the other as the close
trees do not provide easy group wanderings.

game trail leads down into the masses, animal tracks in the snow.  Almost
too steep to manipulate, it would appear easier to go around and down into
the fires instead of trying this shortcut.  Birds screech overhead but the
view itself is quite surprising.  At night, the fires appear like those of
the stars in the sky, dotted and twinkling. During the day, the &amp;Ksm&amp;wo&amp;Kke&amp;n

      <roomdescription>Beyond the camps, beyond the level ground, is a place of cold serenity.  
The bottom of the hill ends in an overhang of sorts, rocks jutting out
from the wannabe mountain in such a way that they create the perfect
thinking spot. Close to being a &amp;Kc&amp;wa&amp;Kve&amp;n, the snow has not reached the back
of the area, the ground cold and hard but without ice.  It gives the
impression that a tumble of boulders fell into a perfect formation for a
couple to step out of the &amp;Kr&amp;wai&amp;Kn&amp;n. To the right is a rock big enough to sit
on for rest or relaxation, with a clear view of the accepted camp.

      <roomdescription>This campsite lies nestled into the bottom of the hill, safely out of the
wind.  There are several tents about the area, but only one fire.  There
are a few items strewn about and left forgotten, utensils in a chair
waiting for dinner to begin, a pile of laundry waiting on eager hands, and
a trunk that has a nice coat of ice on it, now.  The fire is warm but not
by any means the largest that has been seen so far, obviously not by hands
that have kindled one often.  The trees sheltering the camp from the sky
are mostly rid of snow, it having been so heavy it fell, adding inches to
the ground beneath them that has yet to turn to mud.

out of any decent home long ago, holes and spots of dirt showing.  The
tent has a warm glow from the outside light caressing the yellow color of
&amp;yfa&amp;Ybr&amp;yic&amp;n used to shelter the occupants. Despite the cold, it is far from
warm.  The only source of real light or warmth is one candle in the center
of the room with only a few hours left for it to burn, when once burning
again. There is a pile of &amp;Kb&amp;woo&amp;Kks&amp;n near the back side of the tent, a pile of
papers close to it.

set it up where the fire and tent would be mostly out of the wind.  The
fire burns brightly and looks well tended while the &amp;rc&amp;ya&amp;cm&amp;mp&amp;n itself is small
and cramped.  The wagon has been stripped of wares and they all seem to
lie scattered about. There are spools of &amp;rt&amp;yh&amp;cr&amp;me&amp;ra&amp;yd&amp;n here and there, bolts of
&amp;rc&amp;yl&amp;co&amp;mt&amp;rh&amp;n, even &amp;rb&amp;yu&amp;ct&amp;mt&amp;ro&amp;yn&amp;cs&amp;n have fallen from their pouches and lie on the ground.

large ice covered boulder is just to the east and it looks like several
campers tried to take advantage of it.  Novices run through, possibly
using this as a servant would use a back hallway.

folded under.  In an attempt to hide this, the chairs are placed around
the walls of the &amp;Ktent&amp;n allowing the center of the space to be &amp;Wvacant&amp;n. Not
a table one is in here, not a candle, and certainly nothing for warming

yellows collects the &amp;Ksick&amp;n and &amp;Kwounded&amp;n and tends to the needs of those that
cannot care for themselves.  It is a place of peaceful relaxation for
those that need it, but busy and not entirely quiet.  Girls in white pass
through often, helping tend to the fires and the food, not to mention the
sick.

rest upon with a brazier to keep the air warm.  Upon the desk is a box

the entrance to the tent. Several chairs and tables used are actually

rug has been dropped as a carpeting to keep the feet warm but almost looks
wet.  There are a few candles scattered about, all needing to be melted
down and made into a useful candle with a couple of hours burning time.  
A small ivory box has been put on the makeshift table, the only spark of

      <roomdescription>At the edge of a hill lies a camp, well made, and well placed for defense.
The fire is the closest thing to the path, the tent closes to the hill's
edge but with enough room to be defended if it were needed.  The tent is a
nice green color and stands out against the brown of the trees and white
of snow.  The fire seems to be only for warming use as food is not cooking
here, but several men are about seeing to things, likely for their Aes
Sedai.  There are a group of boxes to the right of the tent, stacked so
that they may be used for a table if needed.

      <roomdescription>This tent, unlike the others, is quite spacious.  There is a desk with
several papers stacked up on it, looking like one map weighted down on top
of another.  A large map of Tar Valon hangs on the back, hung up with
whatever could be used.  There are marks in ink at various points, but
there is no discernible pattern appearing when looked upon.  The space is
warm and with stools so that a few people could enjoy it if wanted, or for
planning, which looks to be the theme of the Green Ajah tent.

      <description>The map is large, too large for the desk.  The corners are too used to
being rolled up, trying to pull away from the flimsy wall of the tent.  
It shows a very accurate layout of Tar Valon and the surrounding area,
certain points marked in ink.  If one were to try to find a pattern, they
would be out of luck as they don't seem to have any benefit to an army of
this size, so it would seem.

      <description>The desk isn't of the best wood and looks to be suffering badly with the
weather.  In the center is a pile of maps, weighted down with whatever
seemed at hand.  There are not ink spots on these, only the clearly drawn
lines of a careful hand.  Instead of being centered around Tar Valon,
these depict Altara and the surrounding areas, one of the lands where they
are and about to head into.  A stack of papers are to the right of the
maps, weighted down, uninteresting.

The paths that are available have all turned to &amp;Km&amp;wu&amp;Kd&amp;n and the wetness from

almost completely in the blinding whitness.  From this vantage point,
tracks of animals and small surviving game can't be seen, the &amp;Wearth&amp;n as
smooth and white as one could never think possible.  The path to this
specific spot hardly seems touched as well, not even by hunters and scouts
or the few birds that fly. The &amp;Wtrees&amp;n provide shade but not from leaves
and fullness but limbs covered and encased by frozen snow.  The entire
landscape seems to &amp;Wglow&amp;n, especially at night by the &amp;Km&amp;Woo&amp;Kn&amp;n. One might think
this is one of the more beautiful spots to enjoy throughout the area of
the camp.

      <roomdescription>This area appears to be watched over by a tree so large and so vast that
one couldn't count the years it has seen.  It's knotted and close to sad
looking, the limbs weighed heavily down by snow and ice, the nests of
birds showing in the highest of its age old limbs.  There are tracks
around it in the snow, small animals trying to take shelter within it.  
The roots that splash up and back down into the ground are large enough to
sit on and one appears to have some sort of carving on it.  The trunk of
the tree appears to have a hole about five feet up just under the knot of
a lost limb.

the trees show through the haze of snow but that appears to be it.  The
snow drifts come above the ankles for most, making an unusual sound with
each well placed foot.  From here one could see the valley below that
seemingly has two layers of &amp;Wsnow&amp;n, one on top of the trees and one on the
ground beneath the covered limbs.  There is a quiet peacefulness here as
one could almost believe they had left the camp behind if not for the fog
of &amp;Ksm&amp;wo&amp;Kke&amp;n in the air the wind blows in this direction.

&amp;Wsnow&amp;n that is untouched by foot or hoof. The trees stand in their natural
state, the inches of fluffy &amp;Wcoldness&amp;n stacked onto dying limbs and bending
leaves.  It seems a valley waiting for someone to discover it, holding
back whispers and murmurs of the beauty it has seen in nature.

light rain spans away.  The wind doesn't reach here underneath the
covering of snowy limbs but above the snow shifts with each gust,
threatening to fall but never succeeding.  There are spots in the snow
where birds or other critters have dug looking for food or insects, their
&amp;Wprints&amp;n clear in the snow under the trees.

Trunks remain packed and everything in easy reach in case the word is

cooking in combination with soldiers constantly on the move.  The tree

several inches on each side for about twenty spans where the water melts
it before cooling enough to no longer affect the snow.  A widening a few
feet from the source of the spring is surrounded by dirtied snow crossed
with deep wagon ruts and numerous footprints.  The track is only barely
wide enough to allow a wagon to pass, the trees thick and foreboding on

death of winter.
