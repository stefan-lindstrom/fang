      <roomdescription>Here, the three main roads that run through the town meet and join,
at a square alive with people of all races and ages.  There is a \c06w\c13e\c11l\c04l\c00
in the middle of the square, seeming to be a meeting place for the
people of the town; a few wooden benches have been placed out in the
\c10s\c08u\c10n\c00.  The people in the square, aside from the natives, seem to be a
huge mix from almost every nation; although mainly merchants,
Illianer, Tairen and Andoran for the most part, there are quite a few
who seem to be travellers, or perhaps refugees; the difference
between the two is little, and all too often absent.  From here, the
three main streets branch off through the city; the \c03Caemlyn\c00 road to
the north, the \c02Illian\c00 road to the south-west or the \c04Tear\c00 road to the
south-east.

      <roomdescription>The \c04Tear\c00 road stretches through the city, eventually passing through
the gates to the south-east.  The road is crowded, filled with people
on foot, wagons, and the occasional horse; the riders, cursing
merrily, have great difficulty controlling their mounts in the
crowded mass of people, and are not helped by the uneven cobbles of
the street.  To the north-west, the street can be seen to run into
the central square of the town, where the three main roads that run
through Far Madding meet; beyond there, far to the north, the Hills
of Kintara are visible on the horizon.

      <roomdescription>One of the three roads that are the main reason for the existence of
this town, the \c02Illian\c00 road approaches the central square of the town
here.  The rough cobblestones of the street make passage easy if a
little bumpy to cart, wagon or foot, but horses have a little more
trouble - especially considering the unreasonable crowds that this
town contains.  Although a fair number are the merchants that are
more usual to the town, a large proportion seem to be travellers, or
refugees - it is hard to tell the difference; both types are equally
dusty and both have a lost, aimless, almost hopeless look about their
eyes.  The road continues to the south-west, filled with people and
carts making passage difficult, or meets the \c03Caemlyn\c00 and \c04Tear\c00 roads
just off to the north.

      <roomdescription>Far Madding's \c03Caemlyn\c00 road stretches north and south here, running
directly through the crowded town.  Here, the street seems to run
into the town's central square to the south; a small well is visible
through the crowds in the center of the square, and past there, the
\c02Illian\c00 and \c04Tear\c00 roads stretch through the city to the south-east and
south-west.  North of here, past the gates of the city, a range of
tall, rolling hills, some almost small mountains, are visible; the
road seems to curve up into them and run right through them,
disappearing into the horizon.

      <roomdescription>Here, the \c03\c03Caemlyn\c00\c00 road branches off to either side, with alleys
squeezing between the buildings at both sides of the wide street.  
The tiny streets appear to lead out of the noise and bustle of the
main street, and into the quieter, calmer areas of the town.  The
street itself runs straight from the northern gates to the main
square, just a little way to the south, where the three main streets
of the city meet.  Roads to \c04Tear\c00, \c02Illian\c00 and \c03Caemlyn\c00 all meet and
join in this city, making it a bustling center for trade and
commerce.  This road itself runs through the Hills of Kintara, just
visible as a jagged horizon past the city's gates to the north,
before reaching Andor and eventually the capital \c03Caemlyn\c00.  On either
side of the street, tall buildings crowd against each other; most
seem to be houses or inns, although a few shops do front the main
thoroughfare.

\c02Illian\c00 gate at the south-west edge of the city to the square, a
little way to the north-east, where all three main roads of the city
meet.  The road itself is in good repair, the cobbles evenly spaced
although worn; the passage of carts and tens of thousands of hurrying
feet has done much to age the roads of the city.  The crowds fill the
street almost completely, the sound of a hundred arguments, disputes
and bargains filling the city like the roar of a small \c04o\c06c\c02e\c06a\c04n\c00.  
Wagoneers, cursing, attempt to force their way through an already
overcrowded passage, with people afoot and the occasional horseman
roaring insults at the lumbering carts that threaten to knock several
people over.  From here, a few small alleys on either side of the
street force their way between overhanging buildings, seemingly
leading to a quieter part of the city.

      <roomdescription>The \c04Tear\c00 road runs directly through the city, from the gate at the
very south-west to the central square, where all three of the town
meet and join.  The town is situated at the very north of the Plains
of Maredo, just south of the Hills of Kintara, and makes an ideal
neutral ground for trading between \c04Tear\c00, \c02Illian\c00 and \c03Caemlyn\c00.  Made up
partly of merchants and traders, although with a large number of
travellers - or possibly refugees; the difference is almost
imperceptible in most cases - the crowds, passing slowly and
lethargically through the \c01dusty\c00 streets, fill the town almost to
bursting.  An inn stands just to the west here, the sign outside
displaying a grey-haired musician strumming on a harp.  The lettering
above the image shows the building to be the \c23Grey \c10H\c03a\c10r\c03p\c10e\c03r\c00 inn.

      <roomdescription>The \c03Caemlyn\c00 road continues through the city here, running directly
north to south.  The street here is cobbled rather than paved, and
the dry dust of the city fills the gaps between the cobblestones,
running between them like sand.  The houses seem of poorer quality
here, out from the central square, with \c14whitewashed\c00 rather than
painted walls and loose tiles on the roofs.  The people of the town
travelling in the streets seem to be outnumbered by the outsiders; Far
Madding truly is a merchant's haven, although there are more than a
few other travellers in the crowds, refugees perhaps.

the area closer to the center, the houses whitewashed rather than
painted, some in bad repair.  The road stretches on to the

coating of dust, and the same coats the clothes and hair of most of
the travellers along the road.  The people themselves are a huge mix;
a large part are merchants, but a significant proportion are also
travellers - whether travelling by choice or refugees is not certain.
Every nation on the continent seems to have at least some members

occasional vain &quot;Move along&quot; or &quot;Make way&quot; is called out, but none

      <roomdescription>The \c02Illian\c00 road spreads out here, widening as it runs deeper into the
city.  Running directly from the \c02Illian\c00 gate, a way off to the
south-west, to the central square to the north-east where the three
main roads of the city meet, it is crowded with people from almost
every race and occupation - although strangely, hardly any who wear
\c04Tairen\c00 clothing are seen on the road.  Those who are, mostly
merchants, are usually surrounded by guards, and walk swiftly.  For
the rest, natives of Far Madding seem to be largely outnumbered by
strangers from outside; the few who look as though they might be from
the city are largely hawkers, travelling through the streets and
crying their wares, or shopkeepers, standing near their stalls with a
wary eye for thieves.

      <roomdescription>The \c02Illian\c00 road comes close to the south-west gates of the town here,
a bustle of people travelling both away from and towards the gate.  
The occasional city guard is visible through the crowd, mostly in
tarnished breastplates and wielding pikes; most pay no more heed to
them than they do to the other travellers they pass by - a cursory
glance, perhaps a curse from the wagoneers when they get in the way,
but no respect.  From here, the road continues to the south-west,
where the gate makes an opening in the wall, or on to the north-east,
where it meets the other two main roads of the city in the central
square.

      <roomdescription>The \c02Illian\c00 road runs directly into Far Madding here, a gate causing a
breach in the high wooden walls of the city.  The entire area on both
sides of the gate is crowded with a multitude of people of all races
and occupations; although a fair number seem to be the merchants one
would expect from a town such as this, there are also large amounts
of travellers - perhaps refugees, perhaps not - crowding the city
entrance.  A few guards lean against the wall by the gate,
occasionally rousing themselves enough to shout hoarsely at those
blocking the gate.  From here, the \c02Illian\c00 road continues into the
city to the north-east, widening as it goes; or the unpaved dirt road
goes on to the south-west, crossing the Plains of Maredo and
eventually reaching the city itself.  To the west, the guardhouse
stands, a low, fairly squat wooden building.  To the east, a street
runs just inside the wall of the city, stretching from this gate to
the next, the \c04Tear\c00 gate in the south-east of the city.

      <roomdescription>The first room of the \c23Grey \c10H\c03a\c10r\c03p\c10e\c03r\c00 seems to be a neat, tidy place,
quiet and homely.  There are no overt signs of luxury displayed in
the entrance hall, but the polished wood of the walls and the thick
carpet underfoot seems to promote an air of comfort.  A wooden
counter stands against one wall, with a smiling woman, the inn's
proprietress, usually behind it; just beyond there, a doorway leads
into the first common room of the inn.  Soft \c03m\c10u\c09s\c02i\c04c\c00, accompanied by
the lull of conversation, is audible; the inn seems to have no
trouble with rowdy patrons.  Of course, considering the prices for
rooms that a discreet sign over the counter shows, the lack of the
more...  Undesirable side of town is not surprising.  A door at the
back of the room seems to lead to the stableyard, and the sounds of
the city are vaguely audible through the front door.

      <roomdescription>Tables lie scattered about this large, high-ceilinged room, to the
casual eye seemingly randomly placed; a closer glance, however, would
reveal that there is a strict order to the positioning of tables, to
create easy pathways for the serving maids that move about the room,
bringing patrons their orders.  The patrons usually seen are
merchants, dressing in plain clothes of the finest material; mostly
\c02Illianer\c00 traders, although a fair few from other lands are visible,
usually discussing business with their southern partners.  
Strangely, considering the location of the town, not a single \c04Tairen\c00
is visible throughout the entire inn.  A staircase at one side of the
room leads upstairs, to the guest bedrooms; a half-open door at the
other seems to lead into the second common room.

      <roomdescription>The upstairs corridor of the inn, well-lit by a series of oil-lamps
in brackets against the wall, is as plush and comfortable as the rest
of the room.  The polished wood of the walls gleams softly in the
light, and the floorboards, although uncarpeted out in the corridor,
are also polished to a bright gleam.  The entire corridor speaks of
wealth and hours of hard work by serving maids.  A faint smell of
\c03be\c10es\c03wa\c10x\c00 is scented, as well as oil from the lamps.  From here, the
corridor stretches to the north and south, doors on either side of
the hallway leading to rich rooms.  Some are locked and obviously
occupied, while others are vacant.  The occasional open door shows
lush, luxurious interiors to the rooms.

table in the corner, accompanied by the soft keening of a flute.  
The musicians, a man and woman in decidedly less rich clothes than
most of the inn's patrons, sit on a small, raised platform at one end
of the room.  The smell of food drifts through the room from the
kitchen, the door of which is just at the end of the room.  Another
doorway, through which stairs leading down into what seems to be a
cellar, is visible at the other side of the room.

      <roomdescription>The huge array of smells in this long, low-ceilinged, \c14whitewashed\c00
room is almost as striking as the incredible \c01heat\c00.  A \c08fi\c01re\c10pl\c08ac\c01e\c00 at
one end of the room, a sweating spit-dog turning what appears to be
half an entire \c03oxen\c00 over the fire, is mirrored by a huge stove
spreading across the opposite wall.  There is a long wooden table
stretching along the center of the room, covered in all kinds of
pots, pans and cooking utensils.  Through all of this dart the
serving maids, picking up plates of food, bringing back empty dishes
for the scullions laboring over the sink at one corner to wash.  
Sweating, red-faced cooks appear to do more shouting than cooking,
and nervous undercooks seem to be doing their best to stay out of the
way of any chance of being seen and ordered back to work.  A window
opening onto the stableyard at one side of the room does nothing to
relieve the heat.

almost as high as a man, hold ale of various kinds; smaller barrels
and casks hold brandy, wine, whiskey.  One side of the cellar is
entirely taken up by a rack holding cheeses of various sizes and
shapes, and other food that needs to be stored in the cool depths of
the cellar is also visible.  \c00

to offend the delicate noses of the patrons, contains little more
than a few mounting-blocks, a large pile of horse manure in one
corner, and three or four young grooms skulking against the stable
wall, talking quietly among themselves and obviously intent on
avoiding the head groom.  A wide wooden gate at one side of the rough
enclosure leads out onto a quiet street in the south part of town,
the cobbled road empty and deserted.  The long, low building that
contains the inn's stables is just to the south, and the main part of
the inn is back to the east.

through a small \c13skylight\c00 in the roof.  On one wall, a large rack

floors of the inn and the buildings on the opposite side of the alley
sloping inwards, and only a few rays of sunlight penetrate the
foot-wide gap at the top.  Despite the darkness, the alley is not
cool with the shade; a muggy, stagnant stench fills the place, and
piles of refuse lie against the walls.  From here, the alley

road branches off from the main street, and winds its way through the
town to the east.  On either side of the road, spilling out into it
in some places, is a huge variety of stalls and shops - some seeming
permanent, low wooden buildings, and others nothing more than carts
with the sides down, farmers standing warily behind them.  It seems
that all the items the surrounding countryside can manage to produce
is here; from huge piles of \c03turnips\c00, sacks of \c10grain\c00, barrels of
\c02a\c01p\c08p\c09l\c02e\c01s\c00, to \c01butchers\c00' shops with pheasants and rabbits hanging from
hooks just inside the doorway, to protect them from dust and thieves.
The less permanent stalls seem to be completely run by the farmers
themselves, whereas the buildings are owned by shopkeepers from the
town.  The sounds are almost as strong and varied as the smells -
loud haggling at every junction, roared accusations of short weight,
others of theft.  The market continues on for some way to the east.

      <roomdescription>The \c04Tear\c00 gate guardhouse sits here, a low, squat, wooden building.  
The planks that make up the walls and roof are nailed together
roughly, the entire place speaking of shoddy workmanship; it looks as
if it might fall down in a high wind.  The place is shady, however,
and the interior - what is visible through wide cracks in the planks
and gaping holes that could only be called windows by default -
appears to be cool.  Just to the west lies the Tear gate, and the
south-east road.  Directly south of here lies the permanent palisade
that makes up the wall of the city, and its main defense.

      <roomdescription>The first room of this tavern is large, high-ceilinged and broad,
although not roomy.  The tables scattered about the room, with little
or no regard for order or position, see to that.  The place appears
to be closer to a drinking den than to an actual inn, or a meeting
place, as most of the other establishments in the town seem to be;
the conversation is loud, raucous, and frequently argumentative.  
The interior is slightly darker than one would expect, owing to the
shutters having been firmly fastened - a few \c01t\c10o\c08rc\c10h\c08e\c01s\c00 on the walls
provide the only illumination bar the occasional chink of \c10light\c00
through the blocked windows.  A long counter serving as a bar stands
at one side of the room, a rotund man in a \c03stained\c00 apron polishing
glasses behind it.

paraphernalia behind it indicating that it is for conducting business.

of shelter from the worst ravages of the heat at this time of year.
Right up against the northern part of the wooden palisade that forms
the city's first and only defense, it becomes apparent to a careful
glance that the small hut is not simply close against the wall, it is
part of the wall - only three walls of the shack are actually built,
the fourth one being the stout, close-fitted logs of the palisade.

guardhouse, just to the west, has quite obviously stood there for

wood of the walls and roof show that it is not so much a house as
simply a place for men to sit out of the sun and talk.

being sold among the ever-moving, permanent hubbub of the market; at
one side of the street, a whole row of stalls seem to be devoted to
\c14wool\c00, the edges thick with merchants; at another, loud arguments
erupt over the price of small barrels, seeming to hold \c02Illianer\c00
\c03tabac\c00.  A long, low building to the north appears to hold some of the
more delicate products that the countryside produces, requiring
shade; the market itself continues on to the east and trails off to
the west.  Through it all move the city \c08gu\c01ar\c08ds\c00, ubiquitous, solemn,

hold entire racks of cages holding plump, violently protesting
chickens; makeshift corrals pen in mules, pigs, sheep, cattle, even
the occasional horse seems for sale here.  Just to the south lies a
slightly quieter building, appearing to be a gathering place for the
trackers and hunters that live about here - pelts of all manner of
animal are on display outside, and an occasional glimpse through the
doorway proves that even more glorious are inside.

manner of \c08f\c01r\c02u\c09i\c08t\c01s\c00 - ranging from the exotic to the plainly ordinary.
The display, glorious as it is, is quite obviously wilting; most
fruits are shriveled if not outright dried, and there is a kind of
desperation on the faces of the farmers.  The last non-existent

wall, the palisade of thick logs providing an effective barrier to
any further spreading of the market.  However, this part of the
market seems to be the most active, with tables and stalls right up
to the wall itself.  The occasional low building intersperses the
other stalls, the rough wood of the buildings providing shade and
enclosure for those goods that should be kept out of the heat - or
shelter for those farmers rich enough to afford such.  Merchants
crowd the area, most with expressions of distaste appearing on their
faces every time they see a farmer, which means that most wander
about inspecting goods with permanent sneers.

to provide somewhere to sit rather than for any semblance of comfort.
A barrel in one corner of the room holds pikes and bills, and another
swords; a rack nearby houses the peaked breastplates that seem the

headboard.  The carpet is a quiet \c09green\c00 shade, carefully patterned
with repeating geometrical designs around the edges.  A fireplace at
one end of the room, with a polished \c23stone\c00 - not marble, although
finely cut - mantlepiece, stands clean and soot-free.  A few
armchairs around the room are upholstered in the same soft \c09green\c00 as
the carpet.  On one wall hangs a small tapestry of a peacock in
deep, cleverly-woven \c02greens\c00, \c04b\c11l\c04u\c11e\c04s\c00 and \c05purples\c00.

      <roomdescription>This room seems to mirror the rest of the inn in appearance and
quality; welcoming, comfortable, and luxurious without seeming overly
pompous or displaying its wealth too loudly.  A fireplace at one end
of the room, unlit in such weather, is kept meticulously clean of
ash; the mantlepiece holds a small \c14m\c07a\c23rb\c07l\c14e\c00 clock, its quiet ticking
barely noticeable.  A table dominates most of the room, the \c03oaken\c00
surface gleaming softly with a shine that speaks of long hours of
\c03p\c10o\c03l\c10i\c03s\c10h\c03i\c10n\c03g\c00.  Chairs are arranged neatly along the table, enough to sit
ten or fifteen guests if need be.  A few more comfortable armchairs
are placed by the hearth, and a few small tables stand between them.
The one door is heavy oak, and thick enough to discourage any
thoughts of eavesdropping.

most luxuriant.  Dominated, although not crowded, by a large
four-poster bed, with silk sheets and soft down pillows, it also has
two large, over-stuffed armchairs in front of the \c23m\c07a\c14rb\c07l\c23e\c00 \c01fi\c08re\c10p\c08la\c01ce\c00,
each large enough for a medium-sized person to comfortably disappear
into, and several less decadent chairs scattered around the room.  A
writing desk stands unobtrusively in a corner, with a straight-backed
oaken chair standing in front of it.  A clock on the mantlepiece
ticks quietly, barely audible; the sound is swallowed up by the soft,
deep \c04blue\c00 Taraboner carpet that covers the floor from wall to wall.

first room of the tavern, although only barely.  The arrangement of
benches rather than single chairs, and more orderly positioning of
tables, shows that this is a room built for dining rather than
drinking; the doorway to the \c03ki\c10t\c14c\c10h\c03en\c00 at one side of the room is
propped open by a stool, and frequent shouts and the clatter of \c01pans\c00
can be heard.  Each table has several chairs around it, which seem to
be fairly comfortable if not exactly well-made or expensive.  
Serving maids circulate among the tables, taking orders and bringing
food.  All seem clean, if not entirely beautiful.

Substantially smaller than the dining room, a clutter of pots, pans,
dishes and plates, most dirty or at some stage of being cleaned,
cover every clear surface.  A huge stove at one end of the room has
several pots simmering on it, each seeming to hold soup or stew.  
The food visible looks wholesome if not rich or refined, mainly solid
fare - soup, bread, stew and beef.  Vegetables in large amounts seem
lacking, although whether that is due to the scarcity of such or the
desires of the customers is not clear.  A staircase at the back of
the room, squeezed uncomfortably between the wall and the stove,
seems to lead downwards to the cellar of the inn.

soft, comfortable chairs and small tables lie scattered about the
room.  At one end, a long wooden counter stands, a rack of keys
visible behind it.  Apart from that, the room appears to have been
built purely for the relaxation of the guests; a carpet covers the
floorboards almost up to the walls, patterned in rich \c01r\c08ed\c01s\c00 and
\c03ye\c10llo\c03ws\c00.  A flight of stairs next to the counter appears to lead to
the guest rooms, and another door to the dining room.

underground, and although fairly low-ceilinged, are wide and long.  
Ale barrels line both walls in this part of the cellar, the relative
coolness of the underground area keeping them at a reasonable
temperature.  Further along, barrels of \c09c\c02i\c09d\c02e\c09r\c23 are stacked
side-by-side, and following them are smaller casks of \c01wine\c23.  One
area, an alcove set into the wall, seems to be set aside for the
small casks of stronger drink; the warm, golden smells of \c03brandy\c23 and
whiskey fill that part of the cellar like \c10su\c03nl\c10ig\c03ht\c23.  \c00

full of \c02vegetables\c23 and meats in various stages of pickling, and the

the stairs up to the kitchen filters through.  \c00

twisting around from its gently meandering passage to cut into the

through, or the council simply couldn't be bothered to finish the
job; either way, a bare patch of \c23dusty \c03ea\c10r\c03th\c00 has been left just to
the side of the newly twisted road.  Whichever buildings stood there
before have evidently been knocked down, the rubble carted away; and

as the main entrance which serves as a common room of sorts; purely
for the comfort and relaxation of its guests.  There are windows to
outside on two sides of the room, shutters hooked open to let a
refreshing \c13breeze\c00 flow through.  Tables of varying sizes are
scattered about the room, places laid on several.  The chairs
standing at each table seem to be light and comfortable, easily
moveable.  A small board nailed to one wall reads what the menu
consists of for each day.  At one side of the room are the kitchens,
the clattering of \c01pans\c00 audible even out here, and the other door
leads back out to the entrance and common room.

slamming, even the footfalls of rats magnified a hundred times.  The
room is not amazingly wide, but rather tall; its walls reach up, with
rafters crossing at intervals, and occasional planking nailed over
them - creating precarious footholds for workers.  Obviously it was
once a large warehouse, storing \c03g\c10r\c03a\c10i\c03n\c00, or \c14cloth\c00, or one of a hundred
things that this town needs in bulk; but now it has fallen into ruin.
The rafters are rotten, some ready to give altogether at an unwary
step, and the spiders grow to gigantic sizes on the insects that buzz
through the broken windows.  Lazy \c10sun\c03li\c10ght\c00 drifts through the gaps in
the planking and the \c06sh\c13at\c14te\c13r\c06ed\c00 glass of windows, illuminating the

the \c10sun\c00 shines directly through it, illuminating glittering \c03dust\c00
motes in the stairwell.  A jar of \c05flowers\c00 has been placed by some
thoughtful hand on the windowsill, although the thoughtfulness seems
not to have extended to watering or replacing the wilting blooms.  
Directly in front of the staircase, a thick oaken door appears to
lead to a private dining room, for those guests who prefer solitude
to the main common and eating rooms downstairs.

      <roomdescription>The peace of this area, compared to the roar and rush of the three
main roads running through the town, is almost physical.  A few small
streets and alleys form a clear area, a loose square in the center -
a few benches set on the cobblestones make it obvious that this is
where the townspeople congregate, away from the noise of the roads.
A long, low building just to the east displays a bunch of \c02he\c09r\c02bs\c00 hung
in one corner of the window, and seems to be the town healer's house.
A narrow road winds down between houses to the south, eventually
meeting the wooden palisade that makes up the city wall.

      <roomdescription>This house, although small and rather low-roofed, gives the
impression of greater space through the neatness and meticulous
arrangement of every detail and stick of furniture.  A wide wooden
cabinet, fully as tall as a man, stands against one wall; a table, of
similar wide dimensions, fills most of the center of the room.  
Although one side of the table is kept clear, the other side is
filled with a large variety of pots, jars, bags and tools; three
different sized pestles and mortars, several knives obviously for the
chopping and preparation of \c02he\c09r\c02bs\c00, empty, cleaned-out \c23c\c03la\c23y\c00 and
\c14porcelain\c00 jars.  All of the items on the table are arranged with the
same neat precision as the furniture.

      <roomdescription>A quiet collection of houses stands on either side of this street,
which in construction and atmosphere could not be further removed
from the main roads that run through the town.  Evenly-laid, smooth
\c23stone\c00 cobbles pave the street, worn down to an almost flat surface by
the passage of generations of feet and horseshoes.  Occasionally the
houses on either side of the street give way to small shops or other
buildings, the only thing separating them from the regular houses
small, unobtrusive signs \c14painted\c00 above the doors.  The most visible
of these are on either side of the street here; one, to the west,
shows a clenched, \c03leather\c00-clad fist, and appears to be a
glovemakers'; the other, to the east, appears from the sign to be the
front end of a \c23stonecutter\c00's workshop and warehouse.

another street here, one running through the south part of Far
Madding.  Both are fairly quiet, although the wall road has a little
more traffic - mainly people wishing to get from the area of one gate
to another without going a roundabout route.  The north-south road,
however, is almost the picture of tranquility; hardly any of the
travellers through the main part of the city journey into the quiet,
secluded inner parts of the town.

piles and slabs of \c23s\c07t\c14o\c07n\c23e\c00 stacked against every wall.  A window high

\c23d\c03us\c23t\c00 covers the floor as well, and the wooden counter near the back
of the room, giving the entire room an almost haunting tinge of dusty
grey.  The counter itself is the only element in the room that shows
it to be a shop; the rest of the building, which appears to be one
single room, is full of blocks, slabs and shapes of cut \c23s\c07t\c14o\c07n\c23e\c00, and
tools for cutting it.  These are arranged neatly in racks against two
of the walls, each together with its own kind; hammers, from huge
ones that a blacksmith could barely heft, to tiny, almost delicate
ones, and chisels in the same variety.

The street is emptier and somewhat cleaner than the main roads that

a thin layer of \c23grayish\c00-\c03brown\c00.  Apart from the dust, the road is
fairly pleasant; a small \c13b\c14r\c07e\c06e\c13z\c14e\c00 even finds its way between the houses
on the northern side of the street and the wall on the southern,

unenviable job of taking down the logs that make up the wall, moving
them a few hundred paces, and restoring them; even now, a number of
tools on the ground, accompanied by discarded breastplates, and the
gaps in the wall of logs show that the town's primary defense is in

      <roomdescription>The kitchen of the \c10Hu\c03nt\c02er\c09's \c04Lodge\c00 is a large, high-ceilinged room,
with plain \c14whitewashed\c00 walls and a long wooden table dominating the
center of the floor.  At regular intervals along the walls, mostly
taking advantage of the large oak beams that support most of this
half-timbered building, hooks are fixed; most support copper or
cast-iron pots and pans.  A large \c01stove\c00 at one side of the room
radiates \c01h\c08ea\c01t\c00 throughout the room, and all the windows are habitually
open to afford at least a semblance of moderating the temperature.  
Back to the east, a large swinging door leads to the dining room of
the guest house.

bare wall, crossed by a few beams.  A large window has been set into
the end of the corridor, with a seat just underneath it, angled so as
to catch the full effects of the glorious afternoon sun.  The frame,
although painted a plain \c14white\c00, is tinged a regal \c01r\c08e\c01d\c00 and \c03g\c10ol\c03d\c00 from
the light.  Doors stand at intervals down the hallway, and although
most seem occupied, at least a few appear vacant.

mainly given over to the richer shops and trading houses, along with
the residences of the more successful citizens.  The people native to
Far Madding are, for the most part, as racially diverse as the
travellers which make up a large part of the town's populace; most,
from their looks, could be from any land between \c01Tarabon\c00 and \c04Tear\c00,
and the local speech is a curious blend of \c06Lugarder\c00, \c02Illianer\c00 and
\c04Tairen\c00 accents.

      <roomdescription>The road continues to run in an east-west direction here, although it
visibly turns just to the west, almost doubling back on itself to run
straight back to the Caemlyn road.  This street, however, takes full
advantage of its relative isolation from the main roads; both sides
of the street are crammed with all manner of shops and booths.  
Established buildings are more in evidence than the temporary canvas
stalls, although the latter do clog both sides of the wider parts of
the streets; the smell of \c08ro\c01asti\c08ng\c00 \c03chicken\c00 drifts through the air,
enticing travellers to spend their coppers on the hot snacks that the
vendors offer.

north-west, north, and finally back to the east, taking one back to
the \c03Caemlyn\c00 road a little further north than where the road
originated from.  The town seems to grow quieter - and, for that
matter, richer - as it moves away from the main roads through the
town; this quarter is mainly given over to shops and trading houses,
areas for the richer merchants to congregate, meet, and cheat each
other blind.

warehouse to double back to the east.  The road itself is a loop,
coming from the \c03Caemlyn\c00 road to the east and returning to it a little
further on.  On both sides of the street, signs above the doors of
the many shops show what is for sale in each one; from \c23k\c07n\c14iv\c07e\c23s\c00 to
\c10s\c03addle\c10s\c00 to \c01s\c03p\c10i\c08c\c03e\c01s\c00, it seems that all anyone could ever need could be
found here.  Strutting down the streets, usually with guards or
soldiers accompanying them, can be seen the merchants that make up
the larger part of this town's visiting population.

for bolts or bales of cloth to be displayed.  A wooden counter for
the shopkeeper stands at one end of the room.

various flat surfaces, is located at the very west of this building,
directly under the roof.  Because of this, it has a curiously sloping
ceiling, starting off reasonably high - close to the door - and
remaining level for about three paces into the room; then it slopes
sharply, tilting downwards to be barely four feet above the ground at
the very end of the room.  The room seems homely, even lived-in;
there are several thick \c03oaken\c00 beams visible through the \c14whitewashed\c00
plaster of the walls, testimony to the half-timbered structure of the
building.  The splintery floorboards are covered by a thin \c04woolen\c00
carpet, spreading its \c11b\c04lu\c11e\c00-dyed width over the floor from wall to
wall; it gives the impression of some strange \c13l\c06i\c02qu\c06i\c13d\c00 pooling under
the insane ceiling.

although it is not immediately obvious; the cluttered furniture, each
piece crowding against another, and the low ceiling make the room
seem smaller than it actually is.  Two beds stand at opposite sides
of the room, in the corners opposite from the door; each is covered
with neatly-folded linen sheets and a dyed wool blanket, one \c04b\c11lu\c04e\c00,
the other \c02gr\c09e\c02en\c00.  A stone fireplace stands at the exact center of the
back wall, directly between the two beds, with a few chairs crowding
the space in front of it.  With all of this, there is barely space
for the washstand and basin that stand at one side of the room, a few
steps away from a window looking out over the city.

polished to a warm, golden glow, and a faint smell of \c10be\c03esw\c10ax\c00 spreads
out from the oak, permeating through the room.  The scent mixes with
the faint, almost permanent odor of \c23charcoal\c00 from the largely clean
fireplace, and the dusty smells of a large city that drift through
one of the open windows.

threadbare carpet and worn-out upholstery on the chairs.  Light from
the large window at the south side of the room, opposite the door,
falls onto the \c05purple\c00 and \c01r\c08e\c01d\c00 of the carpet, enriching the otherwise
dusty and worn room and making it seem closer in atmosphere to a
palace than a cheap, run-down room in a guest house.  The window
itself gives a good view of the town of Far Madding, the wooden wall,
and finally the open grassland and road beyond that.

next to it that would otherwise hold firewood stands empty, with the
fire-irons arrayed in a neat row on their stand next to it.  The
furniture of the room mainly consists of two large beds at opposite
corners of the room, facing the door, a wooden table next to each of
those, a washstand and basin, and a few rather lived-in chairs,
upholstered in a muted \c02green\c00, by the fire.

of knives and similar tools for both work and defense.  Working
closely with the \c23blacksmiths\c00 of the town for his new materials, the
proprietor obviously accepts only the best in second-hand blades and
tools.  Several racks along the walls and on tables about the room
display those items which are for sale - although paring knives and
other tools figure largely, the main items that this shop deals in
are of the type needed by travellers - \c02hunting\c00 knives, belt-daggers,
working blades.  There are even a few throwing daggers among the
array, and one long blade that could almost be a shortsword were it
not so thin.

comforting, smoky atmosphere.  The smell seems to have seeped into
the very timbers, and regardless of what stock may be in the shop at
the moment, the smell will never vary much.  Several large barrels
line one end of the room, each with a label held onto the front with
a blob of wax; &quot;\c11Two Rivers\c00&quot;, &quot;\c10C\c03airhie\c10n\c00&quot; and &quot;\c02Illian\c00&quot; are visible.  
Nearer the front of the shop, several smaller casks are stacked on
top of one another, of the more portable variety; easier to buy, and
to sell.  Along with the casks appear several pipes, seemingly for
sale as much as the \c09l\c02ea\c09f\c00 itself is; of many different designs,
uncarved and fanciful, \c23silver\c00-inlaid \c22ebony\c00 and stout \c03oak\c00, they are
collected together, almost carelessly stacked for any who will to buy
one.
