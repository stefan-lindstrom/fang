      <roomdescription>A vast layer of puffy &amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;n clouds stretches out as far as the eye can
see, &amp;Yg&amp;yo&amp;Yl&amp;yd&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;n rays of &amp;Km&amp;yo&amp;wo&amp;Kn&amp;yl&amp;wi&amp;Kg&amp;yh&amp;wt&amp;n peek ever so slightly through the soft layer
of fluff, illuminating the area in a gentle wash of light.  At various
points within sight, comfortable looking seats and other furniture and
creations from someone's &amp;ri&amp;ym&amp;ga&amp;cg&amp;bi&amp;mn&amp;ra&amp;yt&amp;gi&amp;co&amp;bn&amp;n are scattered, some near to others,
made of gathered mountains of soft clouds, all looking ready to poof out
of existence at a mere touch.  This, however, is not the case, the chairs
and other objects all being solid enough to actually use.  High above, the
sky is a &amp;bd&amp;Ba&amp;br&amp;Bk &amp;bb&amp;Bl&amp;bu&amp;Be&amp;n color, tiny points of pure &amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;n flickering in odd
patterns, like a child creating their own connect-the-dots game.  
Overall, a surreal and relaxing feeling lays over this area like a layer
of &amp;Kf&amp;wo&amp;Kg&amp;n, seeping into the soul of anyone fortunate enough to spend any
amount of time in this place.

wagons led by teams of horses in numbers of eight or twelve.  At night the
road is less traveled, though there is a wandering group or two on
occasion.  Dust covers the road, the grass beside the path trampled by
animals and people not able to find room on the road.  The northern gates
of Ebou Dar are to the south, one of Ebou Dar's famous horse tracks just
visible in the distance to the southeast.

nothing but a large stone circle from the outside.  The hard packed &amp;yd&amp;Ki&amp;yr&amp;Kt&amp;n

sides.  Most of the houses have low domes, some of them striped in vibrant
hues &amp;rr&amp;Re&amp;rd&amp;Rs&amp;n, &amp;gg&amp;Gr&amp;ge&amp;Ge&amp;gn&amp;Gs&amp;n, and &amp;yy&amp;Ye&amp;yl&amp;Yl&amp;yo&amp;Yw&amp;ys&amp;n.  One of Ebou Dar's many canals ends to the
south, continuing eastward, its gloomy waters looking rather slimy.

wall, small shops and buildings lining the south side of the street.  
Some of them appear to be rather run down, though none of them are in a
complete state of disrepair and ruin.  Even the worst houses in Ebou Dar
seem like palaces compared to the best in the Rahad section of the city,
located across the bay.  The thoroughfare is paved with light &amp;Kgray&amp;n stones,
leading toward and away from a city square to the east.  The &amp;kDa&amp;Kl E&amp;wi&amp;Wr&amp;wa &amp;KGa&amp;kte&amp;n
is somewhere to the northwest, a canal beginning to flow to the east.

Beginning here, the canal continues eastward, passing under many bridges
and bending south toward the bay.  To the west, a small square spreads out
before the northern side gates to the palace.  An estate, most likely
owned by a noble, can be seen to the northwest, the domes of the manor

a noble's estate to the southwest and the higher city wall of Ebou Dar to
the north, both covered in &amp;wwhite&amp;n plaster.  The walls of a small house are
to the south, arched windows looking onto the street from the second
story.  The domes of the nearby buildings are all pale shades of &amp;cblue&amp;n, the
dome of the noble's manor is a striped &amp;Bb&amp;bl&amp;Bu&amp;be&amp;n and &amp;Yg&amp;yo&amp;Yl&amp;yd&amp;n that sparkles in the
sunlight as it spirals upwards.

Dar, the dark paving stones worn smooth by years of shuffling feet.  
Piers and docks jut out over the bay every now and then, the wooden walk
directly to the east stained with an unknown dark substance, a small
building constructed on the pier.  Directly to the south, a large square
built atop a low bridge opens up over a canal emptying into the bay, the
area seeming like a good resting spot if one has nothing to do.

sparkling water stretching out to the east.  Docks and piers branch off
the road and into the bay, a small building constructed on the pier

collapse, white plaster chipping from the building in chunks.  The door is
slightly ajar, though the glimpse of the room beyond tells of recent
visitors being nonexistent.  The southeast tower of the city lays in the

      <roomdescription>Dark &amp;Kgray&amp;n flagstones pave this road, shops and inns lining the street on
the south side.  The Dashar Canal merges with the canal flowing on the
north side of the path, a small bridge spanning the canal and leading into
a small plaza directly north.  The faint sound of horses drift through the
air, the sound coming from the stables to one of Ebou Dar's many inns to
the south.  To the west, a brightly painted sign hanging above a large inn
is almost impossible to miss, a large square built atop a bridge laying to
the east.

      <roomdescription>The shops and other buildings become fewer the nearer to the bay district
the road draws to the east, the bay itself stretching out for miles beyond
a square built atop a bridge directly to the east.  To the west, Hara
Street runs along numerous shops toward &amp;mMol &amp;KHa&amp;wr&amp;Wa &amp;wS&amp;Kqu&amp;mare&amp;n and the Tarasin
Palace.  The canal running along the north side of the road continues
toward the larger body of water to the east, shifting southward slightly
to merge with yet another canal beneath the &amp;rE&amp;Ras&amp;wt &amp;WSq&amp;wu&amp;Rar&amp;re&amp;n and flowing into
the bay.  To the north, a small bridge spans the canal, leading to the
closed doorway of a large building with a sign painted with an open book
hanging above the doorway.  A smaller building with a sign depicting an
ink bottle and quill hanging over the doorway lies directly east, the door
standing open in welcome during the daytime hours.
