      <roomdescription>This broad, dusty road leads either east or west, the dry, &amp;ysun-baked&amp;n land
to either side occupied by widely spaced farmsteads.  The grasslands are
&amp;ydry&amp;n, suffering under the pressure of the blistering &amp;rh&amp;yea&amp;rt&amp;n caused by the
over-long summer, and the devastating drought that it's caused.  To the
west, the small town of Four Kings is visible, and to the east the road
stretches on into the distance.

      <roomdescription>Standing just within the limits of Four Kings, the city appears to be a
small dusty town that lies between Caemlyn and Whitebridge.  Roads lead
away from the town that many use to travel to Lugard in the south or the
rest of Murandy.  There are great number of merchants here, selling wares
or passing through with the looks of their closed carts.

      <roomdescription>Standing on the main street that runs through this dirty little hole in
the wall, one could see the roads that lead to Baerlon and Aringill.  The
buildings give the impression that they have not been taken care of, each
showing signs of wear and tear at the edges, at least.  Horses are
scattered about with their owners, searching for resting spots, or
stopping to talk and trade.

      <roomdescription>The main street stretches into the east and west as far as the eye can
see.  Farms dot the hillside like dead ants and the hills do nothing to
detract from the road dust kicked up almost constantly.  The inn to the
north sounds to be lively, voices carrying with the oven breeze that
blows, a mouthy man standing at the door looking as if he's about to try
something stupid.

      <roomdescription>Many traveling types traverse this main street that runs through Four
Kings.  The road itself reaches from Aringill all the way to Baeron in the
west and seems to be a spot on the road where the travel weary find solace
and comfort at one of the many inns situated along the way. White washed
buildings and worn down wood, but none seem to lack guests.  The road
appears to be full of people with the same idea.

      <roomdescription>Passing along the busy main street running through Four Kings, several
well armed guards march past, seeming to be in a bit of a dizzy from
drinking too much.  A small cart carrying odd shaped rocks from the
western mines reaches a stop close to the center of the road to the north,
where a large blacksmith and weaponry shop lies.  To the south the town
continues and there is a square close and visible.

Four Kings.  It is also part of the Queen's Road which runs from Aringill,
through Caemlyn, all the way to Whitebridge in the west.  People gather
about and talk, a few carts offering goods, but it seems that everyone is
intent on getting somewhere other than here.

      <roomdescription>The street widens a bit here, and there is a large stableyard to the
north, by the side of the 'Traveling Wench' Inn, which seems
faintly reminiscent of the inns in Lugard to the south. Small stone
houses line the street to the south, and one of them has a bundle
of herbs tied with a yellow ribbon over the door. This is presumably
the local Wisdom.

stop by the side of the road to search for the source of the scent.  
There is a small bakery to the north, where a homely old woman is most

Whitebridge.  All about are travelers moving in the heat, sweating,
looking dirty.  Occasionally a group or a person stops to beg for food or
pull something small from their packs.  A warm steady wind carries from
the south, dust and heat mingled together into what some call a miserable
experience.

would be hard for even a horse and cart to pass

street children run past laughing to themselves

where travelers, merchants, and townsmen gather to buy and sell
merchandise from all over the world.  Although the sound of laughter and
fluid voices carry from the south, people and stalls are very different
from one another.  Farmers, dressed in clothes little better than rags try
and sell dried and sometimes rotting fruits and vegetables, while scowling
townspeople are lost in their own thoughts.

      <roomdescription>Called the Queens Road by it's residents, this part
of the Four Kings show much more grace and style than
some of the other portions of this small town. A well
dressed lady in a bright red coat passes by, pulling
a small cart laden with flowers and calling loudly
the freshness and quality of her wares.

how tidy and well kept it's appearance is. From the small fireplace 
along the western wall to the neat row of books that rest on a

house. It is only the sense of wrongness that is everywhere that 
does not put you at ease. On closer imspection you can determine 
that the house is so clean because all the furnitiure are brand 
new and have been given the look of age for some reason.

up from his work to stare at you and you can't help but to notice

A large cookfire is attended by some men who patiently turn the

others come to attention and the \c01red\c00 shephards crook on his \c14white\c00
