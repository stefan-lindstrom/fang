      <roomdescription>This is the Western Square, the fabled Whitebridge that this town was
named for is directly to the west.  The Square bustles with the
activity of those who wander about their day-to-day lives, their
voices causing a general din within the area.  In the exact center of
the Square is a large, pristine fountain, crystalline water trickling
from the myriad of carven images that adorn the raised block of ivory
that rests in the center of it.  In the northeastern corner of the
Square rests a large wooden stand where behind it stands an older man
calling out often to those who walk by him, apparently trying to sell
his wares.  Cobbled roads lead to the north, south east and west,
into the jumble of houses and other various buildings.

      <roomdescription>The gleaming Whitebridge begins here, pristinely rising up in a
gentle arc to span across the River Arinelle.  The impossibly fragile
looking bridge seems to be made of some kind of odd white glass,
though it is said that is never becomes slick, even in the hardest of
downpours.  It is rumoured to have been created during the Age of
Legends, and seemingly is one of the greatest wonders of the known
world.

Below the River Arinelle flows strongely, churning and bubbling.  
The City Docks are visible over the railings of the bridge to either
the north or south.  Often rivercraft either large or small set sail
from the piers to makes their way from Whitebridge along the river.
Further to the west, the bridge continues to rise towards the apex
while to the east the bridge gently descends down into the city.

The forests along the western shore of the bridge are now visible.  
A clearly defined path moves into away from the bridge and into the
forests.  The river below you sparkles in the sunlight while that
same light gleams off the crystalline and fragile looking bridge
beneath you.  Occasionally barges or boats pass beneath, the water
lapping at them and the pleasant scent of moist earth rises from the
riverbanks.

fisherman or others walk to the west apparently seeking their

the docks here, supplied and ready to go out on to the river.  
Occasionally someone walks by to either the east or the south, or
even to climb into one of the boats here.  Often small groups of
fishermen will gather here to discuss there trade, while occasionally
you may see a one who does not appear to belong here, a one dressed

raggedly dressed people here.  In the exact center of this Square, there
is a circular area which is protected by a large wooden fence.  In the
middle of the circular area an ancient oak tree stands, it's branches
extending out over the fence.  Around the oak tree is a well tended patch
of grass, though it seems withered by the constant heat which seems to
plague the world.  Buildings also stand along the streets here, signs
propped hanging from wooden posts displaying their goods and services.

large wooden stand with several bits of finished work rests,
displaying the quality of the smith's goods for all to see.  In the
west wall, a large door is set with a shiny brass doorknob and
keyhole.

      <roomdescription>The backroom of the smithy is filled will all types of assorted
things.  Several stacks of wooden boxes are scattered haphazardly
about this room in varying sizes and shapes.  Behind one such stack
is a large wooden barrel filled with several scraps of iron.  Upon
the west wall there hangs a large portrait of Voran himself holding a
large hammer over the anvil.  Oddly enough just beneath the picture
upon the floor there is a large rug of faded red with several layers
of dust, though there is a single footprint that has disturbed the
dust.

A tall man, who appears to be an aielman, wields a gleaming
sword in both hands. He stands opposite a man who is clad in 
shadow, the only thing visible of his body are the fiery
orbs that look out from the man's hood. He holds a dark
staff as he faces off against the aielman. Below them are
small peoples, who appear to be locked into some form of

filled with roses, a window opened just above the table, the soft
breeze sliding through and spreading around the scent of them.  
Several other miscellaneous objects are here for the use of the

      <roomdescription>This is a circular area, in between the walls of the passageways.  The source
of the sound of rushing water seems to originate from this area.  A large pool
of crystalline water is in the center of this area and from a large hole in the
ceiling there is a constant flow of rushing water down into the pool.  The
walls are almost indistinguishable from the transclucent, glowing moss which
covers almost every inch of their surface, this area being almost brightly lit.

      <roomdescription>This is the Bank of Whitebridge.  This is a large one-room building
with several shelves and desks placed around at various positions,
although there is only one area that is accessible to the common man.
The room spreads out wide with three and one half foot wooden walls
that are used to guide passage towards the large desk which
predominates the room.  Sitting behind the desk in a comfortable
chair is a young woman with a bright smile, ready to perform any kind
of banking need.  Behind her is a small gate in the wooden wall which
opens up and allows passage to the desks of the other clerks in the
area.  Behind the woman to either side of her stands a man wearing
the colors of Andor and with a sword belted at their hips.

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThis large chamber is quite obviously the &amp;kInner Sanctum&amp;K of someone who
either thinks they are powerful or obviously is.  The chamber itself is
grand in scope and in the form of a large square, the room being fifty
feet wide, by fifty feet deep and thirty feet high.  Set amidst the
&amp;Ko&amp;wb&amp;Ks&amp;wi&amp;Kd&amp;wi&amp;Ka&amp;wn&amp;K floor tiles, in the exact center of the room is a large, gigantic
throne-like chair with strange, odd &amp;Ks&amp;wp&amp;Ki&amp;wd&amp;Ke&amp;wr&amp;Ky runes drawn along its
blackened planes and surfaces.  The chair itself rests atop a slightly
raised dais of obsidian and seems to almost draw the eye as it is there in
the exact center of the gigantic chamber.  In the northwestern corner of
the room, a large, canopied bed rests almost drawing the eye as much as
the throne-like chair.  The bed itself is enormous and coverd in the
finest of &amp;mp&amp;Ku&amp;mr&amp;Kp&amp;ml&amp;Ke&amp;m v&amp;Ke&amp;ml&amp;Kv&amp;me&amp;Kt silks as well as beautifully-patterend blankets
and several comfortable-looking pillows.  &amp;KNearby the bed, within ten feet
or so to the right of it, set into the northern wall is a large sink and
basin, with strange faucets which allow for running water, while further
eastwards, there is a porcelin basin, with a lip which is raised roughly
six inches above the obsidian floortiles.  Surrounding the oddly raised
basin are four walls formed of glass, one of them with a small knob which
would allow entrance into the odd, squarish room with the basin at its
bottom.  Inside the small area on the wall are two faucets, one marked
&quot;hot&quot; and one marked &quot;cold&quot; while at about seven feet in height is an odd,
metallic device with several holes that expels water when either of the
two faucets are turned.  Set into the floor in the southern portion of the
chamber is an odd, circular piece of &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;Wy&amp;K metal with strange carvings
and runes upon it, runes that glow an iridescent blue color when someone
stands upon the strange piece of metal.  Set into the eastern wall of the
chamber is a large, stone fireplace with a fire seeming to blaze always
within its depths while standing to either the left or right of the
fireplace are two statues of men, formed seemlessly of iron and made to
appear as two, taller then average men.  Oddly, the eyes of the two
statues seem to glow with an inner, fiery red light and move occasionally
as they seem to move about at odd, random intervals.  &amp;n &amp;KResting against the
western wall of this chamber is a gigantic wooden desk as well as a
book-case which rests beside it, just south of it.  Many small, scattered
and miscellaneous objects rest atop the planes and surfaces of the desk
while within the book-case, books ranging from all shapes and sizes rest
therein.  Although this chamber is oddly bare off decoration or
wall-hanging, there is a certain warmth here, a certain homeliness or a
certain pleasantness or even comfortability which is seemingly exuded from
the area.  Occasionally visible within the area are strange, swirling
mists which float and writhe about, seemingly given off by the fireplace
set into the eastern wall, however the &amp;Kg&amp;wl&amp;Ko&amp;ww&amp;Ki&amp;wn&amp;Kg&amp;K globes which are barely
noticeable, floating as they are at various intervals along the ceiling
give off and even accentuate the mists as their soft, warm light filters
through the occasional, oddly writhing mists.  &amp;n

                        I have found my place to be

                     You're my bride - i`ll die for you
                 Eosophobic wedlock - forever by your side
                       I won live to bid you farwell
                    You`re the embodied core of darkness
                        Pure beauty dressed in black

                         You're the heart of night
                         And now my heart is yours

more thickly clumped, although they are brown and curled, as if the
weather has taken its toll.  A large nest is visible and a large bird

this high and through the boughs and leaves the fabled Whitebridge is
barely visible, but only so because of the light playing across its
surface.

branches are up above and are also thicker with leaves although the
leaves are browned and curling.  The sounds of the hustle and bustle
of passing travellers is audible down below and occasionally shouts
or the neighing of horses can also be heard.  Off in the distance to
the west the sparkling Whitebridge is barely visible, made more so by
it's gleaming pristine structure.
