The surface of the lake is smooth and unmarred, like that of &amp;cglass&amp;n, for it seems that no &amp;Wf&amp;ni&amp;Ws&amp;nh swim in the water, no &amp;ga&amp;yl&amp;gg&amp;ya&amp;ge&amp;n grows on the surface, not even &amp;ydirt&amp;n to make it murky.  Around the entire circumference of the &amp;Blake&amp;n, small &amp;Wwhite&amp;n stones, all indentical to one another, have been placed, an official marker to where the water ends and the land begins.  Just on the other side of the stones from the water, grass &amp;Ggreener&amp;n than is surely possible covers the land like a blanket, the &amp;ggreen&amp;n cushion broken only by &amp;Rw&amp;Yi&amp;Bl&amp;Rd&amp;Yf&amp;Bl&amp;Ro&amp;Yw&amp;Be&amp;Rr&amp;Ys&amp;n of all the colors of the &amp;Rr&amp;ya&amp;Yi&amp;Gn&amp;Bb&amp;mo&amp;Mw&amp;n and more.

An elegant bench of pure &amp;Wivory&amp;n is the only piece of furniture in this whole place, gilted with pure &amp;Ygold&amp;n and padded with &amp;rred&amp;n velvet cushions.  &amp;RR&amp;ro&amp;Rs&amp;re&amp;Rs&amp;n are carved into the hard bench all along the side, so intricately done that it seems as though the bench &amp;Gg&amp;gr&amp;Go&amp;gw&amp;Gs&amp;n right out of the ground.

comfortable looking leather chairs.  No grand gesture or biblical &quot;&amp;clet
there be light&amp;k&quot; is required to bring about change however, for upon her
entry the ethereal Residence of God is bathed in &amp;Ws&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wm&amp;Wm&amp;we&amp;Wr&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg &amp;Wr&amp;Ca&amp;Wd&amp;wi&amp;Wa&amp;Cn&amp;Wc&amp;we&amp;k, its

forms the floor, the land is spread out like a board game awaiting
players..  Yet this board itself is alive, the restless trees blowing in
the breeze, the seas pounding against the shoreline with the distant,
lulling roar of the ocean.  Antlike, the people of the land continue on
about there daily chores, unaware of the brooding deity who spends the
majority of her time perched on the largest of the leather chairs.  There
are a few other items often scattered around the area as if to add a
little characterising homeliness - or simply due to general untidiness - a
few odd looking devices of twisted &amp;rmu&amp;ylt&amp;gic&amp;bol&amp;rou&amp;yre&amp;gd &amp;Mmu&amp;Rlt&amp;mif&amp;ra&amp;mc&amp;Ret&amp;Med&amp;k materials,
with no visible purpose.  A fleecy &amp;bblue&amp;k blanket is crumpled up on the
largest of the chairs, and near it's right armrest stands an oddly
incongruous gate-post, to which is attached a small tawny she-goat.  From
this odd vantage God keeps her weary vigil, hurls the fiery lightening
bolts of her discontent, and rewards the bulging ranks of her faithful.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>
You suddenly find yourself bathed in &amp;wwh&amp;Wit&amp;ce-&amp;Bbl&amp;bue&amp;n light, flashing reflections
of the sunlight dancing from the leaves of an unusual willow tree that you
stand beneath. It's &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n trunk reaches into the heavens with singular
grandeur, bearing the thick masses of branches that hold those sparkling,
soothing leaves. They can almost be seen through, and they are small and
delicate on their own, yet together they create a magnificent array of
illumination and make this area altogether haunting to dwell within.
Nestled among the roots that break the uneven ground, there sits a large
and comfortable-looking couch draped in &amp;Kblack velvet&amp;n, though how such a
luxury could survive under the bare elements is unclear. The tree itself
is surrounded by strange &amp;Yg&amp;yolde&amp;Yn&amp;n walls, some distance away, all bearing the
windows and towers and bridges of an intricately woven living space. Who
lives there is anyone's best guess, since the perimeter of the tree seems
to be the only inhabited place. A beautiful bar rests, fully stocked, along
one wall and beside it, there is a floor lamp topped with a lovely &amp;rc&amp;Yo&amp;gl&amp;co&amp;Br&amp;be&amp;md&amp;n
&amp;rg&amp;Yl&amp;ga&amp;cs&amp;Bs&amp;n shade. The wall opposite boasts a beautiful tumbling of water down
it's golden surface, sending the sounds and mists of it's passing into
the air. A ways away from it, hovering in mid-air, there is an antique
wooden music box, subtly yet intricately engraved. The last immediately
noticeable feature of this place is a pair of weapons, also suspended -
a longsword and a spear, both of ancient but quality craftsmanship.
The spirits here seem to hold a number of secrets... some suggested
at, and some barely recognizeable at all.

I wake in vain, I dream of love as time runs through my hand.
I dream of fire, those dreams that tie two hearts that will never die.
And near the flames, the shadows play in the shape of the man's desire.

And now she turns, this way she moves in the logic of all my dreams.
This fire burns, I realize that nothing's as it seems.
I dreamm of rain, I lift my gaze to empty skies above.
I close my eyes, the rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of love.

Sweet desert rose, whose shadow bears the secret promise.
This desert flower, no sweet perfume could torture you more than this.
Sweet desert rose, this memory of hidden hearts and souls.

      <roomdescription>\c00Sheer, &amp;wwhite&amp;n curtains blow in the slight breeze that creeps through
the partially open window behind the &amp;ywooden porch swing&amp;n. An &amp;givy&amp;n-
covered trellis running along the side of the porch nearly conceals the
&amp;yrocking chair&amp;n in the corner, the steady creaking noise keeping time
as it moves back and forth. A small &amp;ytable&amp;n sits next to the chair,
a tall pitcher of &amp;Ylemonade&amp;n, ice cubes clinking softly, serves as a
centerpiece. Four empty glasses surround it, just waiting to be filled.
Two &amp;yplants&amp;n dangle on either side of the heavy, oak front door, which
remains open, though the screen door is closed to prevent insects from
entering. A soft tinkle of &amp;yclassical music&amp;n can be heard from within.

A big, comfortable bed occupies the northwest corner and a small stand
with a washbasin sits below a cracked mirror on the opposite wall.  A
misty, glowing portal in the floor seems to lead . . . elsewhere.  Next to
the bed is a small, cluttered desk with some of the papers spilling over
onto the small ice chest next to it.  A large, colorful rug covers most of
the southern part of the floor, scattered with lots of big pillows and
even a couple of overstuffed armchairs.  At the far south end of the cave,
a large entrance gives view to a countryside devastated by fires and
explosions.  This is Cappen's home, the place where he comes to think,
relax, and, yes, vent.  Be at ease here.  As long as you are polite to the

&amp;KThe Despair Factor

Along the path where the &amp;cs&amp;Ct&amp;cr&amp;Ce&amp;ca&amp;Cm&amp;K is talking,
I breathe the &amp;wm&amp;Wi&amp;ws&amp;Wt&amp;K and continue walking.
The &amp;yw&amp;Yo&amp;yo&amp;Yd&amp;K, it whispers in a language of it's own.
As a sigh escaped my &amp;rl&amp;Ri&amp;rp&amp;Rs&amp;K,
I feel the light &amp;mc&amp;Ma&amp;mr&amp;Me&amp;ms&amp;Ms&amp;K of fingertips,
That steal away the &amp;bb&amp;Br&amp;be&amp;Ba&amp;bt&amp;Bh&amp;K, and leave me on my own,
Waiting by the &amp;gs&amp;Gt&amp;ga&amp;Gi&amp;gr&amp;Gs&amp;K.
Waiting, I &amp;Kd&amp;ke&amp;Ks&amp;kp&amp;Ka&amp;ki&amp;Kr...

My whole life is a dark room.
One....big...dark..room.

Do I hear the &amp;kh&amp;Ka&amp;kl&amp;Kl&amp;ko&amp;Kw sound,
Footsteps resounding on the &amp;Cf&amp;cr&amp;Co&amp;cz&amp;Ce&amp;cn&amp;K ground,
or the &amp;Mc&amp;mo&amp;Mm&amp;mf&amp;Mo&amp;mr&amp;Mt&amp;K of knowing,
I'll never be &amp;Gs&amp;ge&amp;Ge&amp;gn&amp;K when I fall.
I wait for just one &amp;Rt&amp;ro&amp;Ru&amp;rc&amp;Rh&amp;K...
And I &amp;Yf&amp;ya&amp;Yl&amp;yl&amp;K...
Weightless. &amp;BE&amp;bn&amp;Bd&amp;bl&amp;Be&amp;bs&amp;Bs&amp;K.
Faithless, I'll &amp;Wa&amp;wd&amp;Wo&amp;wr&amp;We&amp;K you.

A single touch before I fade.
Painless let me pass through.

Whenever sang my songs,
On this stage, on my own,
Whenever said my  words wishing they would be heard,
I saw you smiling at me,
Was it real? or just my fantasy?
You'd always be there in the corner, 
Of this tiny little bar.

My last night here for you,
Same old songs just once more,
My last night here with you?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
I kinda liked it your way, how you shyly placed your eyes on me,
Did you ever know?
That I had mine on you.

Darling so there you are,
With that look on your face,
As if you were never hurt,
As if you're never down,
Shall I be the one for you?
Who pinches tou softly but sure,
If frown is shown then
I will that you are no dreamer.

So let me come to you,
Close as I wanna be,
Close enough for me, To feel your heart beating fast,
And stay there and we whisper,
How I loved your peaceful eyes on me,
Did you ever know?
That I had mine on you.

Darling so share with me,
Your love if you have enough,
Or tears if you're are holding back,
Or pain if that's what it is,
How can I let you know?
I'm more than the dress and the voice,
Just reach me out then,
You will know then,
You will know that you are not dreaming.

&quot;Long before these crowded streets Here stood my dreaming tree&quot;
Below it he would sit For hours at a time
Now progress takes away What forever took to find
Now he's falling hard He feels the falling dark
How he longs to be Beneath his dreaming tree
Conquered fear to climb A moment froze in time
When the girl who first he kissed Promised him she'd be his
Remebered mother's words There beneath the tree
&quot;No matter what the world  You'll always be my baby&quot;
Mommy come quick  The dreaming tree has died
Oh have you no pity This thing I do
I do not deny it All through this smile
As crooked as danger I do not deny
I know in my mind I would leave you now
If I had the strength to I would leave you up
To your own devices Will you not talk
Can you take pity I don't ask much
But won't you speak Please
From the start She knew she had it made
Easy up 'til then For sure she'd make the grade 
Adorers came in hordes To lay down in her wake
She gave it all she had But treasures slowly fade
Now she's falling hard She feels the fall of dark
How did this fall apart She drinks to fill it up
A smile of sweetest flowers Wilted so and soured
Black tears stain the cheeks That once were so admired
She thinks when she was small There on her father's knee
How he had promised her &quot;You'll always be my baby&quot;
&quot;Daddy come quick The dreaming tree has died
I can't find my way home There is no place to hide
The dreaming tree has died&quot; Oh if I had the strength...
Take me back Save me please

      <roomdescription>I am awaiting the sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over autumn's proud treetops


I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
You voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again



Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered: &quot;I know...&quot;



We walked into the night
Am I to bid you farewell?



Why can't you see that I try
When every tear I shed
Is for you?

      <roomdescription>The sky is an inky black, one that wraps the whole world in a blanket
of darkness. If not for the full moon, it would be pitch black. But
as it is, the moonlight shines off the ocean - which shimmers like
rolling obsidian. The stars in the sky are easily visible, and
they shimmer and gleam like the most beautiful diamonds - winking 
from millions and millions of miles away. The sand is somewhere
between white and yellow - and the sand closer to the water is cool
and wet. The waves lap softly against the beach - rhythmic wooshing
that signals the coming in of the tide. Looking to either side of
would give a view of the bay as a whole - two giant arms on either
side making a bowl with the water on the inside. It is quiet. And
desolate. There is a small wide wall about twenty feet from the
water - perfect for sitting on. The palm trees that grow in the
grass just on the other side of the wall rustle in the sweet, 
cool breeze.

On the plaque below these words, are a list of the influential people who have graced the Guild and made being a Gaidin on Fang as special as it is. The room itself is lush and well adorned, with swords seemingly everywhere, and a ode to emote fighting playing music in the background. Altogether an impressive sight, this room embodies what it means to be a Gaidin of either Tower on Fang.

      <roomdescription>The porch of the ruins of a long-forgotten Crystal Monk chapterhouse lies in some 
semblance of order here. It has been tidied and reworked, but one cannot deny the 
sense of something old and sorrowful. No red hot lava spews about this dormant 
volcano any longer, but there is a faint tingle of heat which encompasses the place. 
Twin doors of some dark wood lie open here. Obsidian glints all about, hardened from 
the old volcanic activity, giving the entire place a dark shine. A path of stones leads to
the doors, torches lighting crystal hallways in line until it twists out of sight within the
building.

volcano in Therengia which hides it, lies Damaris' inner sanctum. Constructed of delicate
crystals of varying colors, its ceiling acts as a skylight to the heavens above. A large 
table sits at one end of the large hall, a high-backed chair behind it. On the ground in 
front of the desk is a crystal mosaic of the three moons of Elanthia surrounding the lost 
moon. The first, The Moon of Ice, Xibar is constructed of clear crystals that show the 
faintest hints of aquamarine and blue. To the left of it, the Moon of Fire, Yavash, is an 
elaborate design of rubies. The Moon of Sadness is to the right and below Xibar, 
Katamba's face depicted with the darkest of obsidian. Finally, in the center of the three 
moons is Grazhir, the Moon of the Dragon. An ancient script below the mosaic reads, &quot;A
small blade may be small, but it can still kill you from your backside.&quot;
