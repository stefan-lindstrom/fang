      <roomdescription>\c00You've reached the top of the big \c22rock\c00. The view is amazing, showing uncountable
valleys filled with meadows and behind all the meadows a thick, deciduous \c02f\c10o\c02r\c10e\c02s\c10t\c00
stretches over the whole horizon, giving shelter and food to animals and
travellers passing through it. In the mountainwall you can see a well hidden
\c22c\c23av\c22e\c00, barely noticeable without carefully being looked at. Now you can see
the top of the mountain clearer, it's covered with \c07white\c00, \c07f\c06r\c07o\c06s\c07t\c06y\c04 s\c07no\c04w\c00.

      <roomdescription>   \c00The \c03sunshine\c00 fills the \c22cave\c00 with a pleasant light that
abruptly ends in the eastern corner of the \c22cave\c00.  The ground is filled
with huge footprints, to big for a human, leading towards the eastern corner
where the \c03s\c07u\c03n\c07s\c03h\c07i\c03n\c07e\c00 can't beat the darkness.
Even though the \c22cave\c00 opening was hard to find, you find it strange that
it is so huge, almost 13 feet tall.

your lightsource provides shows a huge room, filled with those big footprints
you noticed when you entered the \c22cave\c00.  The ceiling of the \c22cave\c00 forms a dome
filled only with delicately carved lines of \c22hammered\c00 stone, apparently built
by someone very experienced in the art of \c22stonemasoning\c00.  The lines in
the ceiling are shaped as a huge \c10tree\c00 with branches that reaches to
every part of the room.

giving you a feel of joy, all of it in an harmony that seems to be
filled with peace and calm.  Your neck begins to hurt after a few minutes of
looking at the ceiling.  It doesn't matter how long you examine it, you always
find a small detail that you didn't see the last time you looked at the picture.

impossible to see anything, but through the opening of the \c22cave\c00 you can see a
\c03field\c00, covered with long, thick \c09grass\c00 grazed by many herds of \c07sheep\c00, tended by
young \c02Ogier\c00 boys, almost as tall as a man. Behind the \c03field\c00 you can see
deciduous \c10f\c09o\c10r\c09e\c10s\c09t\c00, consisting of enormous \c10trees\c00, many towering several
hundred feet up in the air. This must be the only way to enter the valley, 'cause
it is lying between two mountains, both too high for anyone to climb over.

clothes on, a \c06c\c07h\c04i\c11ll\c04i\c07n\c06g\c00 emotion runs down your spine and then it's gone as
fast as you felt it, leaving a trace of joy and ease in your mind.
This must be an \c02Ogier\c03 stedding\c00, the towering \c10trees\c00 in the forest
on the other side of the field must be the \c02Ogier\c00 precious Great \c10Trees\c00.
The thick, \c09green\c00 grass makes it much easier to walk than the rocky, mountain
road. The surrounding bushes and beautiful \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 make you feel calm and happy
The \c07sheep\c00 are everywhere, like small dots of \c07s\c06n\c07o\c06w\c00 on a huge, \c01c\c02o\c03l\c04o\c05r\c06f\c07u\c08l\c00 painting. 
The mountains that surround the valley are high and seem impossible to climb.
To the south there seems to be a small lake, hidden by a small group of \c10trees\c00.
Some of the \c07sheep\c00 are drinking from the fresh, \c06cold\c00 mountain water.
To the north there's a small hill.
There's a \c03stedding\c00 guard here, waiting for visitors to agree on the \c04Pact\c00:
       No fighting within the \c03stedding\c00. No weapons are allowed.

\c00The \c07sheep\c00 are drinking from the fresh, nutrient \c11water\c00. You find it a bit
awkward that \c02Ogier\c00 children can swim, splash and play in the same \c04lake\c00 as
the \c07sheep\c00. There's a beautiful \c02Ogier\c00 woman guarding them.
The clump of \c10trees\c00 that surrounds the lake give a \c06cool\c00 shade.
The \c10s\c03h\c10o\c03r\c10e\c00 is filled with digging children. They're building huge
\c22castles\c00 that already show their skills in the art of \c22stonemasoning\c00,
it's almost like the \c22castles\c00 blend in with the nature in a perfect
harmony. The towers and walls are covered with soft lines that
seem to move almost like the \c11waves\c00 on the \c04lake\c00, gently flowing
from side to side of the enormous \c10sand-made\c22 castles\c00.

reminds you how you used to chase the girls, pulling their braids and pinching

Wonderful tunes is coming out from the flute that one of the herding \c02Ogier\c00 boys
is playing. He seems a bit unexperienced, but the beautiful sound makes you
wonder how a experienced player would sound. Together with the distant melodies

The \c02Ogier\c00 boys have built a small harbour, filled with boats

The small harbour is made of \c10twigs\c00, \c09leaves\c00 and \c10s\c03an\c10d\c00.

no need to watch them carefully, becasue they seem to be at ease, roaming around
near the \c10stump\c00, listening to the elaborate threads ot tones coming out of it,
grazing the thick, nutrient \c09grass\c00. The girl is very beautiful, her delicate
tufts and thin eyebrowses are an asset to her looks, making her appearance  
more striking then the \c02Ogier\c00 boys'. She's wearing brown and \c02green\c00 clothes,
her dress is embroidered on the waist, a ornate pattern of \c01red\c00 flowers. She 
seems to be lost in her music, seemingly unaware of the outside world as she
rapidly moves her huge fingers, covering different holes on the \c11o\c04c\c11a\c04r\c11i\c04n\c11a\c00 thus  
producing different tunes, tightening the grip she has with her mouth on the

crescendo, ending with a long, vibrating tune that seems to fill the \c06air\c00 for
several minutes, a lasting feel of the joy of being in the nature. Her song
seems to raise the spirits of everything, having a soothing effect, which seems
to linger in the air.

      <roomdescription>\c00By the end of the \c10s\c03h\c10o\c03r\c10e\c00 you see a peculiar \c22rock\c00 formation. It doesn't look
like it is a natural \c22rock\c00, the shapes and curves look more \c04o\c00r\c04g\c00a\c04n\c00i\c04c\c00, almost
like it is an extension of the ground. The lines are delicately shaped, smooth
and gently following each other in an intricate pattern, looking almost like
tendrils of a vine. Nearby the strange \c22rock\c00 you see a heap of tools, \c22h\c00a\c22m\c00m\c22e\c00r\c22s\c00 
and picka\c22x\c00e\c22s\c00, lying in a very neat order. Some young \c02Ogier\c00 boys are hammering
with their picka\c22x\c00e\c22s\c00 against the strange \c22rock\c00. Apparently this must be
some sort of play- and training ground for young \c02Ogier\c00 \c22Builders\c00.

      <roomdescription>\c00The well-used path continues deeper into the \c03stedding\c00. You can hear
singing among the \c10trees\c00, a gentle flow of tunes echoing against the mammoth
hardwoods. Many \c02\c02\c02Ogier\c00\c00\c00 are tending the \c10trees\c00 and they often hum softly,
adding their rumbling sound to the distant song. When you gaze up to the \c06sky\c00
you can see that not many \c10trees\c00 are tall enough to be called \c09Great\c10 Trees\c00,
but the ones who are big enough, loom above you with a majestic presence
that fills you with awe and astonishment and you understand why they are so 
precious to the \c02\c02Ogier\c00\c00. Many other \c02\c02Ogier\c00\c00 are resting from their
different tasks, relaxing under a \c09Great\c10 Tree\c00, being one with \c09nature\c00
in an endless harmony of peace and mutual caring.
Some of the older \c02Ogier\c00 children, who not are playing with the other
childrens, are working together with their parents, learning all about
\c09nature\c00 and how to grow \c03c\c00ro\c03p\c00 right, treat all living things right and
some of them even practice singing to the \c10trees\c00.

      <roomdescription>\c00The \c09Great\c10 Trees\c00 loom above you as a dome, not letting much \c07light\c00 through the
the thick \c02foliage\c00. The \c07light\c00 streams through the \c02foliage\c00 in a way similar
to a \c04waterfall\c00, but now it looks like a \c03s\c07h\c03i\c07m\c03m\c07e\c03r\c07i\c03n\c07g\c00, \c14glowing \c04waterfall\c00.
The few \c03rays\c00 of \c07light\c00 that reach the ground forms a \c02green\c00
carpet with dots of \c07light\c00 together with the thick \c09grass\c00.
Thus the \c07light\c00 beneath the \c10trees\c00 is very feeble, but yet pleasant
in a strange kind of way. You feel at ease here, comfortable with life
and totally relaxed. Many \c02Ogier\c00 are enjoying the calmness, sitting by a
tree, reading or just pondering about something. As in the other parts of
the \c09forest\c00, \c02Ogier\c00 are zealously tending the \c10trees\c00 and the many
\c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 that grow here, enhancing the beauty and harmony of the \c03stedding\c00.
You can also hear singing, but it's seems like there's always a song
lingering in the air wherever you go in the \c03stedding\c00.

      <roomdescription>\c00Leaving the \c02forest\c00 you enter a quite huge clearing. Here many \c02Ogier\c00 are
talking with each other, discussing \c03stedding\c00 issues and other important
things. Some \c01Elders\c00 are philosophizing about the laws of \c09nature\c00. They
seem to be very engaged in the ongoing discussion, thinking hard about
the complicated laws of our world. You can hear their voices from here,
sounding like a distand swarm of \c03bum\c23bleb\c03ees\c00 or like \c22stones\c00 rolling down
a mountain far away. You notice that most of the \c01Elder\c02 Ogier\c00 are
women, wearing beautiful dresses that are \c12embroidered\c00 with many
\c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 that covers most of the upper part of the dresses.
To the north you see a large \c02Ogier\c00 mound and behind it something
that looks like a \c22quarry\c00. To the south you see a beautiful
\c09garden\c00 and another mound.

      <roomdescription>\c00This room is quite large compared to the bedroom and the study. A 
large table of plain \c14marble\c00 stands in the middle of the room, six chairs 
surrounding it, three on each side, all made of polished oak. A nice 
woven \c01red\c00 carpet filled with complicated decorations describing all 
kind of \c04a\c00n\c04i\c00m\c04a\c00l\c04s\c00 and \c09pl\c02an\c00ts, covers most of the floor. Some paintings 
decorates the \c07bright\c00 walls, together with a few banners from
various places around the world. The \c03Golden\c00 Lion Banner from 
Caemlyn and the Nine \c03Golden\c00 \c23B\c03ee\c23s\c00 of Illian Banner are two of the 
banners hanging on the walls. A \c10wooden\c00 wardrobe stands in one 
corner of the room right next to a large coffin. The coffin is made of 
some \c07bright\c00, white wood, with two \c10brass\c00 bands wrapped around it. 
The lock seems to be made of \c22s\c14t\c22e\c14e\c22l\c00, the keyhole the shape of a \c07rabbit\c00.

a small table with large \c10wooden\c00 pipe, filled with tabac, a few \c10wooden\c00 
chess figures, a \c22knife\c00 and an \c23oil\c00 lamp right next to it. The room is 
quite small, the big shelf dominates the entire room, filled with 
hundreds of books. The faint scent of tabac adds to the peaceful

      <roomdescription>\c00Behind \c22Aventalan's\c00 mound there is a small \c22quarry\c00. From here it just
looks like a \c23dark\c00 hole in the ground, but when you move closer you 
see many scaffolds down in the hole. Tools and other equipment that 
are necessary for building are lying in neat order on the scaffolds
some are used by working \c02\c02\c02\c02Ogier\c00\c00\c00\c00 men. Small well-used paths lead to 
the bottom of the hole. Lanterns are intelligently placed on the \c11damp\c00 
walls by the paths, providing enough \c07light\c00 to make the workers able to 
see, even though \c02\c02Ogier\c00\c00 have better sight than humans. A large crane
is standing by the edge of the hole, operated by a strong looking
\c02Ogier\c00. By the crane other \c02Ogier\c00 men are rolling around huge
\c22stone\c00 blocks, placing them according to their size.

      <roomdescription>\c00Huge \c22stone\c00 blocks are stacked up in the corner of this quite large hole 
in the ground. The \c06air\c00 is slightly colder but more humid down here. 
Small drops of \c04water\c00 covers the uneven \c22stony\c00 walls. They \c03g\c07l\c03i\c07s\c03t\c07e\c03n\c00 when
the faint \c03rays\c00 of \c07light\c00 reach so deep in the \c22quarry\c00.  Scaffolds are used 
to transport the huge \c22stone\c00 blocks to the ground. With an advanced 
crane-system they finally reach the ground about one hundred meters 
above the bottom of the \c22quarry\c00. The smaller \c23boulders\c00 are carried by 
\c02Ogier\c00 men, slowly working their way up the steep, well-used paths 
that lead to the ground. Other men are \c22quarrying\c00 nearby the stacked 
up \c22stone\c00 blocks, slowly shaping box-shaped \c22stone\c00 blocks that will be 
used for the fabulous, famous buildings. Some \c02Ogier\c00 men train old 
\c02Ogier\c00 boys, showing them how to \c22quarry\c00 the hard rock without 
denting the pick\c22a\c00x\c22e\c00s and the best ways to form smooth \c23boulders\c00 
which are easier to work with.

      <roomdescription>\c00A warm breeze filled with dozens of peculiar, \c08exotic\c00, \c08s\c01p\c03i\c01c\c08y\c00, \c11aro\c04ma\c11tic\c00 
scents runs gently through your hair as you enter this astonishing 
garden. Flowers in every \c08c\c09o\c10l\c11o\c12u\c13r\c00 you can imagine covers both sides of 
the path that leads to a large \c02Ogier\c00 mound. \c10Trees\c00 in the most strange, 
awkward shapes and colours form a fence around the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00. There 
are only a couple of \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 that you've seen before and the same 
goes with the \c10trees\c00. Many of the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 must have been imported 
from other \c03stedding\c00 or countries. The \c10trees\c00 seem to be very alive in a 
weird, yet enchanting way. When the \c06wind\c00 grabs the \c09cr\c02ow\c00ns of the 
\c10trees\c00, they move in ways similar to a dance, seemingly as they have a 
life of their own. On one side of the path there is a huge bench made 
of solid \c22rock\c00, but shaped in the most extraordinary, fascinating ways. 
Together with the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 it seems like it is an extension of the 
ground. Among the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 you recognize you see \c11blue\c00 \c04anemone\c00, 
\c07lilies\c00 of the valley, \c04bluebells\c00 and \c08red\c01 clover\c00. Beneath the \c09c\c08o\c07l\c06o\c05u\c04r\c03f\c02u\c01l\c00 \c11s\c04e\c06a\c00 
of \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 there's a tremendous amount of \c09verdure\c00, covering the 
ground as a thick \c04w\c11av\c04e\c00 of \c02greenery\c00. The \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 really do resemble a 
\c11s\c04e\c06a\c00, when the wind runs through the thick \c02ju\c09ng\c02le\c00 of \c09pl\c02an\c00ts it looks 
very much a like a \c04w\c11av\c04y\c00, \c09c\c08o\c07l\c06o\c05u\c04r\c03f\c02u\c01l\c00 \c11s\c04e\c06a\c00. At the end of the path there is
a large \c12w\c05il\c12d\c00-\c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c00-covered mound with two windows, one on each side of 
the path. The steps that lead down to the mound are tall, making it 
hard for a human to walk in them.

      <roomdescription>\c00As you enter the mound, you are amazed by the size of it. The 
thick-beamed ceiling is three spans up from the clean, smooth 
floorstones, that are large and irregular in shape, forming an \c01i\c04n\c01t\c04r\c01i\c04c\c01a\c04t\c01e\c00 
mosaic resembling a beautiful \c10tree\c00. In the centre of the room there is a 
tall table with three chairs on each long side. A faint, \c11aro\c04ma\c11tic\c00 
fragrance which is emitted by the \c08exotic\c00 \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 that stands in an 
\c02e\c00l\c02a\c00b\c02o\c00r\c02a\c00t\c02e\c00l\c02y\c00 etched vase in the middle of the table, fills the room, 
lingering in your nostrils in a pleasant way. The room is thirty paces 
from \c22stone\c00 wall to \c22stone\c00 wall.  In the western part of the room there is 
a small kitchen area, where \c02Bjarne\c00 cook delicious meals for his guests.
There's also an enormous \c22stone\c00 fireplace, large enough to fit an adult 
human inside. The fireplace seems to be carved by running \c04water\c00 that 
has shaped the \c22stone\c00 rather than made by hands. Something is carved 
in a \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01y\c00 script in the middle of the fireplace, \c07&quot;Alantin&quot;\c00. This is 
apparently another work of \c02Bjarne's\c00 best friend, the Master \c22Builder\c00 of
\c04Taijing\c00, \c22Aventalan\c00. A small fire crackle quietly in the fireplace, 
spreading pleasant warmth within the mound. In the nortwestern 
corner of the rectangular-shaped mound stands a corner sofa and a 
small table with small figurines as decoration and a couple of \c10wood\c00-
bound books about \c09gardening\c00 also lie on the table. Behind the sofa is a 
square window facing the western part of the \c09garden\c00 outside, with the 
beautiful \c22stone\c00 \c07bench\c00 surrounded by \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00. Several niches along the 
smooth, \c22stony\c00 walls hold lanterns that spread a cosy \c07light\c00 in the 
mound. Many paintings also cover the walls, most of them splendid 
images of \c10trees\c00 and \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00, amazing works portraying \c09nature\c00 in its 
finest condition. \c01F\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 and various \c09pl\c02an\c00ts cover most of the space in 
the rest of the room, emitting odours that blend in a lovely mixture 
that fills the room with an \c11aro\c04ma\c11tic\c00, pleasant, \c08exotic\c00 scent. A fifteen 
feet tall door to the east leads in to \c02Bjarne's\c00 bedroom and through a
slightly smaller door to the south you see a study with bookshelves by 
the left and right walls and a small window on the southern wall.

    <roombasic title="\c02Bjarne's\c00 bedroom" vnum="19128" zone="191">
      <roomdescription>\c00This room is slightly smaller than the living room, not as long but as
wide as the living room. An enormous bed stands in the end of the
room, the \c10wood\c00 carved in delicate lines, and the legs resembling
twisting \c10r\c02o\c10o\c02t\c10s\c00. Beside the bed there is a bedside table made of \c22stone\c00,
shaped in a very \c04o\c00r\c04g\c00a\c04n\c00i\c04c\c00 design. Upon the table stands a sconce,
emitting a cosy, pleasant \c07light\c00 that reaches every end of the room.
Beside it lies a huge, \c10wood\c00-bound book with a spine made of \c02sung\c00
\c10wood\c00. The book is entitled, \c07\c07&quot;\c00\c07The art of \c02Treesinging\c00\c07&quot;\c00. A fine bedside
rug woven in incredible complex patterns that blend and finally
displays a prospering image of a \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01y\c00 meadow lies next to the bed.
On the wall behind the bed hangs a big painting portraying an
unusually large \c09Great\c10 Tree\c00 with winding \c10r\c02o\c10o\c02t\c10s\c00. Among the twisting
\c10r\c02o\c10o\c02t\c10s\c00 grow delightful \c12w\c05il\c12d\c00 \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 and shrubs with \c08exotic\c00 fruits. The
image is full of animals, birds sitting in the \c09cr\c02ow\c00n of the \c09Great\c10 Tree\c00,
sheep \c09grazing\c00 the thick \c09grass\c00 and the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 among the \c10r\c02o\c10o\c02t\c10s\c00,
squirrels collecting acorns for the winter and many more animals.
On the opposite side of the room stands a bookcase, loaded to the
breaking point with books. The books are about subjects concerning
the \c02Ogier\c00, their \c03stedding\c00 and their history. On top of the bookcase
there is a \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c00box made of the finest marble, shaped like \c04w\c11av\c04es\c00. It's
full of exotic \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 in sparkling \c08c\c09o\c10l\c11o\c12u\c13r\c14s\c00. The \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 emit a faint,
\c11aro\c04ma\c11tic\c00 fragrance that fills the room. More \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 and \c09pl\c02an\c00ts
decorate the room, with \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c00pots and vases everywhere, adding
their \c08s\c01p\c03i\c01c\c08y\c00 scents to the fragrance emitted by the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 upon the
bookcase. On the left wall is a square, \c22stone\c00-framed window that
displays the amazing view of the \c09\c09garden\c00\c00 outside, with the huge \c07\c07bench\c00\c00
made of solid \c22rock\c00 standing in the sea of \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00. On the other wall
hang different item of various sizes, many of them resembling
\c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00, \c10trees\c00 or \c02le\c09av\c02es\c00. The thing about them is that they're all made
out of \c02sung\c00 \c10wood\c00. This is \c02Bjarne's\c00 private collection of \c02sung\c00 \c10wood\c00
sculptures. \c02Treesinging\c00 is a very rare talent, so this collection would
be worth a fortune if it were to be sold.

      <roomdescription>\c00This room is smaller than the sitting room, but cosier with books 
everywhere and sprays hanging from the thick-beamed ceiling three 
spans up. Only fifteen paces from wall to wall, not counting the 
bookshelves by each wall. In the end of the room stands a huge desk 
and behind it a small window reveals the backside of the 
\c12w\c05il\c12d\c00-\c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c00-covered mound, a \c09Great\c10 Tree\c00 looming just outside. The 
window is open and birds often fly through the opening, to watch 
\c02Bjarne\c00 work or just explore the mound. They often sit in the \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00
and \c09pl\c02an\c00ts that decorate the rooms in the mound, singing beautifully 
for the mound-owner, easing up his work by the desk. There are many 
books on the desk, lying scattered displaying little of the \c10wooden\c00 
desk's polished, stainless surface. A well-made \c10le\c03ath\c10er\c00 pencil case 
rests upon a book about \c02Treesinging\c00 and several papers written in a 
\c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01y\c00 script almost resembling tendrils of \c02v\c00in\c02e\c00 lies beside the book. 
A desk lamp shaped as a \c10tree\c00 stands on the right end of the desk, 
emitting a slightly feeble but yet cosy \c07light\c00. The huge chair standing 
by the desk has a very tall back, so tall that a human probably 
wouldn't be able to see over it. The left bookshelves contain mostly 
\c10wood\c00-bound books about \c09gardening\c00 and \c09pl\c02an\c00ts, some of them with a 
spine made of \c02sung \c10wood\c00. The lower part of the bookshelves to the 
left contains many books made by humans, names as Jain Farstrider 
shown on the spines of some of the books. The bookshelves to the 
right are filled with books about \c02Treesinging\c00 and things that have to 
do with it. It must be one of the most comprehensive collections about 
\c02Treesinging\c00 in the world. The irregularly shaped, soft floorstones form 
an \c02e\c00l\c02a\c00b\c02o\c00r\c02a\c00t\c02e\c00 pattern resembling a big, \c02green \c09l\c02ea\c09f\c00.

      <roomdescription>\c00In the surrounding forest there are small hills everywhere, some of 
them even stand beside the horse-thick roots of the Great Trees. A pair 
of Ogier men are working nearby one of the Great Trees. They're 
wearing plain, woollen coats that button to the neck, flaring about 
their knees. Most of them have long mustaches that dangle just like 
their drooping eyebrows and some of them also have narrow beards 
under their chin. To the north there is a quite large mound. On a small 
sign hanging above the entrance to the mound, written in a script very 
much resembling leaves and vines that seems to grow and have a life 
of its own, it says: Kristan's leather shop. To the south there is a 
grass-covered mound, not as large as the one to the west of it, but 
almost as big as Kristan's. There are small, rectangular-shaped 
windows framed with stone in it, giving a peep view on its interior. 
Ogier children are playing among the mounds, filling the forest with 
joyous laughs and noisy screams. One thing about their games is that 
no one gets left out, everybody participates and all of them seem to be 
friends. If they would have been humans, someone would surely be 
frozen out. The girls are wearing plain, but yet beautiful dresses that 
are embroidered with flowers and leaves and vines by the necks, not 
from neck to hem as the elder women's dresses are. Most of the boys 
are in their shirt sleeves.

      <roomdescription>\c00As you enter the mound of Armin, you see a lot of crafted objects 
upon a table, to the right of the front door. There is also a lamp upon 
the table, which \c07lights\c00 up the table. A worn, \c10brown\c00 oaken chair is 
facing the table and over the table you see a picture of his family. 
Straight ahead you see a huge \c10brown\c00 oaken bed, fitting a large \c02Ogier\c00. 
Beside the bed, on the right side you see a small table and upon it 
you see several books about crafting and a lamp, which lights up the 
huge bed. On the other side, you see a big well-made closet, a present 
from his father. In the northwestern corner stands a huge bed, 
probably where the parents and sister Mina sleep. In the 
northeastern corner you find a big, oaken table with six chairs 
that are facing the table. Against the eastern wall, near the table 
stands a big pantry and you realise that you are looking at the kitchen, 
where mother Mirna is standing with sister Mina right behind her. In 
the southwest corner, you see Armin's father Andrin, sitting in a huge, 
soft armchair, smoking a huge \c04blue\c00 oaken pipe and reading a big \c01red\c00 
book about crafting, paying no attention to the surrounding. On each 
wall, you see one window, viewing out over the \c03stedding\c00. On the 
walls you also see a lot of pictures of the older generation, like his 
grandfather etc, all with different objects that they have crafted on 
their own.

      <roomdescription>\c00The first you see when you enter this large mound is a desk that 
stretches from the end of the room to the other end of the room. 
Sitting behind the desk you see a friendly \c02Ogier\c00 man. For the moment 
he's working on a pair of \c10le\c03ath\c10er\c00 gloves, carefully etching an intricate 
pattern of \c01f\c03l\c01o\c03w\c01e\c03r\c01s\c00 to the back of the left glove. He has a long, \c23black\c00 
beard that covers most of the lower parts of his face. Streaks of \c22g\c14r\c22a\c14y\c00
have begun to show in his short, slightly curled black hair. As he 
notices you, he greets you warmly, smiling all the time. One thing that 
amazes you is the height of the ceiling in the mound. It's almost 14 
feet up in the air. The walls are decorated with fine, \c10le\c03ath\c10er\c00 objects 
that he has done on his spare-time. Objects of beauty, made to be 
looked at and to fill people with awe and astonishment. You can see 
how his \c04blue\c00, tea-cup sized eyes \c07sh\c03imm\c07er\c00 with pride when he shows 
you his explicit handicrafts. The items that are available in the shop 
seem to be simple, but yet beautiful and well done. It seems to be that 
way with most \c02Ogier\c00 handicrafts.

    <roombasic title="\c00Beside a Great Tree" vnum="19133" zone="191">
      <roomdescription>\c00Towering in a majestic way, with a massive, ridged, buttressed trunk, 
stands a Great Tree between two mounds. The trunk is at least fifty 
paces thick at the bottom. The whole tree must be around two hundred 
and twenty paces tall, looming in the forest canopy. Meandering roots, 
thick as horses cover most of the nearby ground. Dirt ramps take the 
paths over the roots. Some of the roots even rest upon the edges of the 
mounds. Behind an especially large root there is an excited, quite 
beautiful face of an Ogier girl sticking up. She has trueheart blossoms 
in her long, wavy blond hair and she's giggling softly for herself as 
she peers intently at an Ogier boy who's carefully scanning area. 
Apparently they are playing some kind of hide-and-seek. The boy's 
features are much less delicate than the girls, with bushier eyebrows, 
longer tufts on the ears and a more snout-like nose. In the grass on top 
of one of the mounds lies another boy, ears gently twitching with 
excitement and happiness. His green shirt, which buttons up to the 
neck and his dark brown trousers, make an excellent camouflage in 
the thick, long grass. More children seem to be hidden in the rest of 
the area, but they're to well hidden. Even though they're much taller 
than human children they hide at least as well by using creativity. 
Dangling by the entrance to the mound to the north there is a sign 
carved with a green script looking almost like tendrils of vine. The 
sign says: Lenaa's and Hanns's jewellery store. Through the window 
on the front of the mound you see Lenaa carving a brass ring with a 
diamond-tipped pen. Behind it you see dark smoke meandering up to 
the sky.

      <roomdescription>A stone desk that seems to be shaped by wind and water stands to the left
with boxes made of elaborately carved wood on it.  The insides of the
boxes are lined with velvet and they contain rings of all kinds.  Behind
the desk, which takes up most of the space in the left part of the rooms,
sits Lenaa, carefully carving leaves and vines into a brass ring with a
diamond-tipped pencil.  Silver and golden rings wrapped in paper lie
beside her on a small table, most of them already etched with intricate
patterns.  There are also many wooden rings.  On the wall behind her both
wooden and metal necklaces are hanging on hooks.  Beneath the necklaces
there are many glistening bracers, but as with the other jewellery, there
are also wooden items.  Wood seems to be the ideal material for most
things according to Ogier.  To the right there is a bookshelf filled to
maximum with books, most of them about carving.  The mound is about twenty
paces from the left wall, where Lenaa works, to the wall with the
bookshelf.  Near the bookshelf stands a sofa with two seats and a large,
cosy armchair.  Between the sofa and the armchair there is a wooden table
with candles, which enhances the cosiness of the area, and two vases with
colourful flowers.  Beautiful pictures hang along the stone walls and a
stone-framed window, that shows the view of the Great Tree outside, is
nearby the entrance.  An arched door in the back of the room leads to
their private room and to the forge where Hanns is working, shaping the
rings.

      <roomdescription>\c00A huge bed made for two dominates this room's interior. The bed is
made of hardwood and it has a canopy adorned with flowers and
hanging plants. A bed table stands on the right side of the bed and on
top of it there is a wooden lamp and lying beside it there are some
rings. A bookcase with books about jewellery and forging stands by
the eastern wall. Nearby the bookcase there is a tall flowerpot with a
peculiar plant resembling a three-foot high palm. On the smooth,
square floorstones lies a thick, woollen, dark green carpet. The
western wall has a tall, stone-framed window in it, giving a perfect
view of Hanns' forge and behind it, Ogier men working by the quarry
By the window stands a desk made of oak. Several books lie on it and 
there is also writing paper and some pencils. By the desk stands a
huge chair with a high back and a chair cushion made of dark velvet.
In the walls there are many niches containing lanterns that emit
enough light to light up the whole room. The room is about fifteen
paces from wall to wall. Beside the window on the western wall hangs
an astonishing picture, representing the lake in the stedding, Lake
Hylia. It's woven and inlaid with several kinds of jewellery; diamonds 
to make it look like the water surface is glistening, sapphires as water,
jade resembling the thick grass, blue polished opals as the sky and
gold for the sun. It is one of the most beautiful things you've ever
seen. Everything is made to perfection; the weaving, the polishing of 
the jewellery, the insertion of the gems, everything. The stedding's
best seamstress, Ellin, must have done the weaving. And the owner of
the amazing picture, Lenaa, has most certainly made the polishing of
the jewellery and inlaying them too.

    <roombasic title="\c00Hanns' forge" vnum="19136" zone="191">
      <roomdescription>\c00A hot, smoky breeze whirls around here, twisting and winding. Hanns
is working by the forge, shaping a silver ring on a big anvil. Sweat is
streaming down his temples and the whole area around the forge is
heated. His beating a sturdy hammer against the silver, making sparks
fly as they clash. Slowly the contours of the ring emerge. He's
forming it gently, slowly shaping the ring to the actual form of a ring.
Hanns is clad in a leather apron made by the stedding's finest leather
crafter, Kristan, and a sturdy pair of woollen breeches. He keeps his
tools in a wooden box near the forge. An Ogier blacksmith apprentice
is handling the bellows. Beads of perspiration make his tanned skin
gleam in the sun as he works the bellows with all his heart. He's
wearing a shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows and a pair of
black leather pants. Behind the forging area lies the quarry. From here
you can see a large crane being manoeuvred by a strong looking Ogier
and big boulders being rolled around by other Ogier men. A clump of
trees surrounds the forging area, tall bushes standing among the trees
and birds are singing. From the quarry you can hear a distant rumbling
coming from the working men as they sing while rolling around the
huge stone blocks. The heat singes the grass near the forge; it has not
been burned off, only changed it colours slightly, from dark green to a
more brownish green.

on pedestals in the walls.  There are several tables and chairs here, randomly
scattered, and papers and books on top of all of them.
