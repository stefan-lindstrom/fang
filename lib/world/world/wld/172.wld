      <roomdescription>The beginning of \c03Burgess Street\c00 marks the wealthy part
of Amador here. Well made grey and white stone houses are to the 
east, and a large manse is to the southwest. The main road that
passes through the city of Amador and continues on toward Tanchico
to the west and Ebou Dar and Jehannah to the east is to the north.

      <roomdescription>This narrow alley intersects with the main road through Amador to the
north and continues past, near the white walls of the Fortress of Light.
On each side of the alley are several well made stone houses.  Before the
northern intersection, a semi-circle of grass surrounds the road on each
side, filled with hensfoot and other weeds, looking as if the grass has
not been well tended.

up to the \c03Main Square\c00 of Amador to the west. In the square, 
you can see several merchants shouting with haggling customers,
several white cloaked men patrolling the area, and a few women
in black wandering about. To the north, the main road through
Amador stretches east and west, the dust the only thing that 
distinguishes the cobblestone pavement that connects the two
roads.

rickety brick houses. There are more houses to the west, 
all of them badly in need of paint, and covered with withered
vines. To the south, the road bends to the west, becoming

almost large enough for 3 wagons to pass side by side - you 
notice a young woman by the side of the road. She is dressed
in bright clothes in comparison to the other citizens. She is
being held by two soldiers dressed in white cloaks, and she
looks about with a calm stare. An important looking man dressed
in a white cloak with a red crook embroidered on it, and
no sunbursts anywhere in his clothes, sneers at the woman. You

      <roomdescription>Walking along Prospect Avenue, the widest road through Amador -
almost large enough for 3 wagons to pass side by side - you 
notice a young woman by the side of the road. She is dressed
in bright clothes in comparison to the other citizens. She is
being held by two soldiers dressed in white cloaks, and she
looks about with a calm stare. An important looking man dressed
in a white cloak with a red crook embroidered on it, and
no sunbursts anywhere in his clothes, sneers at the woman. You 
decide to move on quickly.

flagstones. The area looks to be the most wealthy in Amador,
as the houses here are large, and everything is well groomed

bag of herbs. He has probably set up shop as a healer nearby.

The common room of the inn is to the south, where loud laughter

      <roomdescription>You enter the lavish sleeping chambers of the Lord of this manor.
There is a large brass bed in the northern corner, and satin sheets
and a fine woolen blanket are on it. There is a large closet door
open to the east, in which many fine robes, breeches, shirts, coats
and longcoats can be seen. A black monogrammed satin robe is hung on 
a hook near the closet, and the entrance to the Lord's bath is to
the south. There is a finely carved writing desk against the northern
wall, and several sitting chairs and footstools are about the room.

tiled with tiny pearl sea shells cut into diamonds and square - 
forming a panorama of animals across the walls of the bath. In
the center of the room is a large carved tub which sinks into
the floor, and has gilt lions across the edges. The place looks
to be designed to be either a regular or a steam bath.

are silver sconces on the walls, and an unused writing desk in
another corner.

There are no gilt furniture pieces, nor is there crystal everywhere 
- like you would find in the manses of nobles. There is, however
a strange carpet covering the southern wall, looking to be from
the lands beyond the waste, because it is of a pattern that you
have never seen before. A tall bookcase is against the western wall,
filled with books such as 'The Adventures of Jain Faistrider,'
'Voyages Among the Seafolk,' and 'The Flame, the Blade and the
Heart,' - most of the books seeming to have a definate traveling
theme.

to the kitchen and a trio of men sit at a dark cubicle. The men
look swarthy and are looking at one another suspiciously. You 
wonder what kind of shady dealings go on here. The Children of
Light are no where to be seen.

hanging on them. There is a low bed in the eastern corner of the

dwelling. Perhaps this house belongs to a reknowned traveler...

of a man smoking tabac reaches your nose. The common room stretches

You look up to the ceiling, and you see a panorama of landscapes
on the ceiling. The entire countryside has been painted on the
ceiling. Sunshine drifts into a small forest, glinting golden,
and rolling plains are off in the western distance. A star is in
the center of the panorama, and you guess that it represents Amador.

Several other fires are burning, each with a pot or cauldron bubbling
slowly. The kitchens stretch to the south, where two open doors lead
to pantries. Three large counter tops are in the center of the kitchens,
where all the food is prepared. There are copper and iron and steel
pots and pans and utensils hanging on the wall to the east. The
sounds of shouting and orders being given out reach your ears, and
several scullery maids rush around helping the cooks.

between the Fortress and the Dome, but not much else. You see several
men patrolling the lookout tower in front of the Fortress, and
the city is simply crawling with Children of the Light.

carpet lining the floor. A small canopied bed lies in a corner, and
a footstool lies at the foot of the bed. An armchair is in another
corner, and a table lamp rests on a writing desk that is against the
southern wall. A small door is at the northern end of the room, leading

which you can see through an open northern mahogany door. There is 
a large bed in a corner, on which several silk pillows rest. The
decor is dark - browns, burgundies and a few cream shades decorate
the room. There is a large writing desk on which a green table lamp
and many papers, notes, letters, and an official seal and black wax
are scattered. The seal looks to be a fox upon a shield adorned with
starbursts. The floor is covered with a plush brown carpet, and there
is a small window that opens onto a parapet to the south.

the noises that emanate from this room. The room is crowded,
and you find it hard to get through. Most of the room is
taken up by several well scratched dicing tables, at which
a pair of men dice avidly, cheered or jeered on by the crowd.
Toward the southern end of the room, a game of impromptu
dagger darts is taking place. Several men wielding iron 
and steel daggers are competing against a woman dressed in
breeches and a longcoat. Daggers adorn her everywhere, and
there is even one in her bodice. Her eyes flash as she competes,
and one would almost think she was born to the game.

majority of worn equipment in this shop, and perhaps you wonder if 
that is Petro's specialty. The shop looks to be well frequented, as 
the floor is dirty and the stairs leading into the shop show many 
scuff marks. The shopkeeper looks about gruffly as you enter, and goes
back to hammering a conical helmet.

seeing as the property is not gated or fenced in, and there are 
few if any servants to greet you. The front area of the house
has two mahogany benches that are carved with a Tairen maze 
pattern, and a clock carved with Avendesora leaves stands in a 
far off corner of the room. To the south a staircase leads upward,
and to the west, the back room of the house can be seen.

Merchants shout their wares, farmers arrange their produce in

foreigners stay long in this city. Only a few can be seen;
A Taraboner woman sells rugs that are draped over a counter top
and several Ghealdean women walk past.

There is a large sunburst painted above the door, and the decor
here is all gold and white - apparently this inn is a favorite
among the Children of the Light. The floor is well swept and
mad of polished oak. Several maids scurry about between the
kitchens to the west, and the two main rooms. A stout woman
greets customers and chats near the bar.

      <roomdescription>You reach the top of the narrow and rickety staircase leading
up to the second floor of the inn from the common room. You
wonder what kind of rooms this inn promises, seeing as the common
room was rather run down. There are doors to rooms to the north
and south.

      <roomdescription>You enter a bedroom to the north, and the small hallway that leads 
to the staircase leading to the common room is south. The room is 
decorated with cheap paper that covers the walls, and peels off in 
certain places. A straw bed lies in a corner, and the sheets that 
cover it onced may have been white. A small spider crossed your 
path as you enter the room, and you wonder what other vermin are 
in here.
