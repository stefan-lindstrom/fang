The remains of frozen and dead plants adorn the area, subtle hints that
people close by care about the area.  There are houses in the distance,
the roof of each covered in snow.  There doesn't seem to be a soul around,
the area recently abandoned, perhaps.

Mainly used by students and trainees, still the occasional

Neatly made, the beds in this room show the same precision
that the Warders are so well known for.  It was that very
precision, that striving for perfection that doomed many
of these men, as thier students learned TOO well.
Heavy chests rest at the foot of each bed, and bright banners
hang at the heads, showing a pride that is unbroken by
the heart rending losses suffered by these men.

      <roomdescription>The first thing you notice is the three sided desk covered in papers and
various articles, the center holds a comfortable black leather chair.  
That looks exceedingly comfortable.  The rest of the room is a bit
different from the rather messy center, book shelves and weapons display
cases line the walls.  In one such display case is not one, but three
outfits of identical nature save for thier color.  One black, one green,
one red.  Each is identical in style, save that the red has all red
leather instead of black leather like the gloves and boots of the other
two.  The cloak of the green suit is different then the rest, patchworked
like that of a gleeman.  At the base of the three lies 2 pieces of a
broken sword with a silver pommel.  The other cases contain a variety of
spears, swords, and daggers.  The bookshelves have several books, some in
common, others in the old tongue.  Finally, on the wall behind the desk
are a series of simple drawings that appear to have been done by the hand
of a child.

is a small kitchen, with a pantry and wash basin, as well as a 
wooden table surrounded by 4 wooden chairs.  There is always a vase
of fresh wildflowers sitting on the table.    In the back right
corner of the cottage is a nice sized wooden bed.  Beside the bed is
a small table that often holds books and a candle or two.  The left
half of the small cottage is a sitting area.  There are 4 comfortable
looking armchairs, another small table and a small fireplace built 
right into the wall.  There is a large throw rug on the floor in 
front of the fireplace, otherwise the floor is well swept hardwood.
There are two windows, one in the kitchen and the other on the back wall,
just to the left of the bed.  The walls are mostly bare, however a large
tapestry hangs above the fireplace, depicting a beautiful scene of
a peaceful forest glade with a brook running through it.

      <roomdescription>This room is a very plain, and simple dwelling. The bed is
placed against the right-corner on the farside of the room.
Placed at the foot of the bed is a polished wooden chest,
on the side of the chest facing you is a sword engulfed in flames.
A small desk has found itself a nice little spot in the left
corner of the room. Scattered across the desk are a few
piles of paper, lined along the desk bookshelf filling up the
space completely are many books. Torches illuminate the room 
completely. Two swords are mounted and crossed above the bed.
One resembles a long-sword by is curved at the end. 
The other is a plain long sword with a jeweled hilt.

      <roomdescription>As you enter this room, the first thing that you notice is
its seeming order and cleanlines. The walls are pure
white, the ceiling and floor, a rich, earthly wooden tone
while several large, dark rugs rest upon it. In the south
west corner of the room rests are large wooden bed,
covered by several large, thick, comfortable looking
blankets, while at the top of the bed, resting against
the headboard is a large, white feather pillow. Beneath 
the bed rests a large, oaken chest adorned with a 
large metal padlock.In the south easter corner rests
a table, while sitting near it are two comfortable looking
chairs. Upon the table rests a basin of clear, crystalline
water. Against the north wall rests a large dresser, 
filled with draws and atop it rests a medium sized
silvery mirror. Light shines into this room by way of 
two windows, one on each of the western and southern 
walls. Large dark drapes sometimes cover these windows
casting the room into shadow.

      <roomdescription>You stand within a large kitchen/dining area, cabinets filled with plates
and utensels lining the west wall.  An open stove sits to the side with an
iron chimney running through the side of the wall, softly glowing \c01embers\c00
providing enough warmth to heat a pot for some tea.  Pots and pans hang
neatly from the hooks that are mounted above the stove.  The east side of
the room contains a small round table, four chairs seated around it
neatly.  A bowl of \c01f\c02r\c01u\c02i\c01t\c00 lies in the center of the table and a small
cabinet just to the side of the table contains brandies and liquors from
the realm.  \c23Si\c07lv\c23er\c00 goblets sit on top of the cabinet, ready for use and
the windows behind the head of the table open to a half circle, showing
the \c06w\c07a\c06t\c07e\c06r\c07f\c06a\c07l\c06l\c00 in the open behind.

north wall with a Shienaran tapestry hanging over the mantle.  A rather
large seating area surrounds the open room, two chairs and a table
situated with a coffee table of polished cherrywood in the center.  
Softly \c03l\c07i\c03t\c00 lanterns are place around the room for good lighting at night,
casting dancing \c23shadows\c00 upon the walls.  Picture windows line the southern
and western walls of this room, providing a breathtaking view of the
\c06w\c07a\c06t\c07e\c06r\c07f\c06a\c07l\c06l\c00 outside.  The west wall is lined with book shelves between the
windows, and on either side of the door that leads into the master
bedroom.  Another door leads to the east, open just enough that you can
see the clutter of a child or perhaps children's bedroom.  Delicious
aromas waft out from the north, signifying the doorway leading that way
could be the kitchen.

    <roombasic title="The Master Bedroom" vnum="3625" zone="35">
      <roomdescription>\c00A bed, that lies against the western wall of this room, seems to dominate
the decor.  It is not overly large but the wooden posts that rise up on
all four corners are intricately etched with \c02i\c07v\c02y\c00 that seem to be climbing
on its own to the top.  The headboard is also carved from the same, dark
stained wood, a swirling design resting over the top of two fluffy pillows
and a deep, &amp;gforest green&amp;n comforter.  A small \c03wooden\c00 table rests on either
side of the bed.  Upon the top of one, rests a large, \c07white\c00 ceremic water
pitcher, a small crack running down the side.  Placed right next to that
is a matching basin for washing, a \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c07y\c00 mirror hanging on the wall
behind the table.  The other table holds a small framed picture, a chalk
drawing of two children that appear to have light colored hair.  The rest
of the room is pretty simple, a chair rests in the northeastern corner of
the room, plush, dark \c11blue\c00 cushions on the seat and the back make it seem
pretty comfortable to sit in.  The light from a single window provides
enough during the day and for the nights, a couple of lanterns are mounted
upon the walls to cast a soft \c03g\c07l\c03o\c07w\c00 all around.

      <roomdescription>Towards the east, the door will barely open into a cluttered room, the
floor covered with toys that have been tossed aside and rumpled clothing.
Two single beds rest on the north and south walls of the room, sitting
diagonally from each other in the corners.  Upon one bed is a doll, its
lopsided face is made from a \c01red\c00 colored yarn, half of the \c03yellow\c00 yarn
that makes her hair missing.  One button eye hangs precariously upon the
tattered face and the other one seems to have been long gone.  The other
bed is neatly made, the covers turned down slightly as if ready for
bedtime at any moment.  A single, plush stuffed bear rests upon the
pillow, amazingly still intact though a bit worn.  \c03Wooden\c00 shelves line the
walls at the head of each bed, holding different toys and jars filled with
Light knows what.

&amp;CEagle&amp;n, imprinting itself into the bed.  The matress of the bed is soft and
feathery though unmade.  In the corner props a sword &amp;Krack&amp;n with &amp;RDark&amp;n
&amp;Rstained wood&amp;n, with 3 empty slots on the rack.  From the ceiling, near the
corner, hangs a three-pronged hook, that looks to be made to hold cloaks
and the like.  On the wall, is a rough sketch of two people.  There are
&amp;CTear&amp;n stains on the glass.....

square.  Large windows are cut into the north, east and west walls.  A
stout door is set into the south wall.  Most of the space is taken up by a
large bed in the northeast corner.  A large wooden chest rests at the foot
of the bed.  The floor is scattered with an assortment of dolls and toys
suitable for a little girl.  Aside from the toys, the room is rather tidy.
A comfortable, fluffy chair is positioned in the northwest corner.  Upon
the walls are hung weapons of various kinds instead of the pictures or
plaques one might expect.
