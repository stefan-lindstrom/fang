    <roombasic title="Outside the Waygate near Fal Dara" vnum="23000" zone="230">
      <roomdescription>The land here breaks into a hill, at the top of which dead gray
skeletons of trees stand around a Waygate. The gate, on further
inspection, consists of a slab of stone, intricately worked with
leaves, seemingly caught in one frozen moment. A trefoil leaf, a
perfect likeness of a leaf that adorns the Tree of Life, also
adorns the gate but seems to be detachable at a touch. The rest
of the land around the hill is barren as far as the eye can see,
with farms along the sides of the road, leading east. In the far
distance you can make out the tops of towers and a high wall
surrounding a fair sized town.

    <roombasic title="Road to Fal Dara" vnum="23001" zone="230">
      <roomdescription>A dusty road stretching far to the east and west greets any passing
traveller.  A mostly barren land with scattered farms dotting the
landscape on both sides of the road, does nothing to improve the isolation
one can feel.  Few people travel this road now, but there are noticable
signs of great movement in the past - hoof-prints driven into the hard
mud, and wagon tracks.

      <roomdescription>Tall walls, grim in their lack of color or adornment, greet any
approaching visitor as they approach Fal Dara.  The ground here has been
hacked at to clear all forms of growth away that may serve as cover for an
enemy.  The gates are high and hard, steel reinforced with steel that
would not be easy to break.  The Black hawk of Shienar flies- above the
walls, seemingly swooping down to attack an enemy.  The outskirts give the
impression of being practical, with no time wasted on beauty.

outside walls. The law of all the Borderlands, to never wear 
headgear that covers the face, is a constant reminder of the
danger that lyes only a few miles north.  Large lanterns line the
streets of the town, holding back the dark, even in the middle of
the night. To the east and west are the guardhouses, where the
guards take their ease while observing the in and outbound
traffic of the gate.

      <roomdescription>In a land that has known nothing but war for 3000 years, since
the breaking, times for peace, happiness and contemplation have
only been attributed to death. yet, when the summer is in full
bloom and the Shadowspawn raids become less frequent, more and
more people come to the sanctuaries to find inner peace. This is
one such place, a calm, undecorated enclosure with polished white
walls that glimmer when the sun from the skylight shines down on
them. White robed priests and acolytes move around the room,
treating the injuries of soldiers and other folk. You hope that
you can find inner peace or be at least able to retain some of it
after you leave this holy place.

Merchant wagons and their guards clear large spaces before them
which are the only spaces of calm in the whole square. Every type
of merchandise from Two Rivers Tabbac to Oranges grown in Illian,
to Taran steel, to Sharan silk are for sale. Even though the
winters in the Borderlands are bitterly cold, the air here is
warm mainly due to the proximity of so many people around you.
The square continues to the north, east and west, while the
street, leading to the south gate is in that same direction.

closer to where their goods are valued. The Swooping Hawk is one
such establishment, numbering many clean but plain clothed
patrons. Merchants will not be caught in town, with fancy
clothing for the simple fact that if they are taken for the
poorer end of their trade, they will make more deals than if they
flaunted their wealth. The standard accompaniment for merchants,
the guards, also patronize the inn, standing around looking for
employment. A Gleeman stands on one table, loudly performing,
while the Innkeeper stands near the door, welcoming new guests to
her prosperous Inn.

wonder how much ale and beer and fine wine is actually in this

Standard for a decent establishment in a decently sized town, a
gleeman and band perform their ballads to long dead heroes and
regale deeds that are probably untrue. Tables, where one can take
their ease are scattered throughout the room, many of them
occupied. But first, something to drink is in order.

Glancing around, you notice that you've placed yourself in one of
the residential areas of Fal Dara. Homes line both sides of the
road, looking tall and grim but with a hint of beauty here and
there in the loving care the people put into their houses. None
of these houses have very big lawns, though you can't imagine
many flowers being able to survive long in the bitter climate the
Borderlanders endure. Eastward, you spot a large market,
logically close to the residential part of town. Westward, the
road continues, leading deeper into the residences.

only for show. The wooden supports and cross-beams that hold it
together would be shattered to pieces by one good ram. However,
it seems there isn't much need for a gate here because of the
large practice field, filled with practicing soldiers beyond it.

eastern residential area of Fal Dara. Houses line both sides of
the road, small but comfortable looking with grim walls. The
grimness of the houses are lessened slightly by the occasional
pattern or design carved and painted into the walls. The ground
under your feet seems like new cobblestone or in good condition
anyways. Even this residential area of the town has the ever
present lanterns on top of polls lining the street as far as the

like or what their commander feels they should do, in their own
barracks. However, certain areas are designated for specific
tasks and this area seems to be where the majority of the troops
sharpen their weapons. Cots line the walls here but lying,
sitting, or relaxing soldiers fill this part of the large
barracks with the sounds of screeching metal. While they sharpen
their blades and undent their armor with hammers purchased from
the city, they chat about old battles and how they killed this
Myrddraal or was the engineer of the destruction of that group of
Trollocs.

upon two soldiers fighting with hands and feet. They are
surrounded by a large group of soldiers cheering their favorite

tournament every so often to determine who the best fighter in
the garrison is. After about a minute of throws, punches, kicks,
body slams and other such painful maneuvers, one of the
combatants manages to pin his opponent to the floor with a
triumphant yell.

      <roomdescription>One thing that is lacking in a soldiers life is privacy. This
lack is perfectly illustrated in the conditions that a soldier
lives in. A barracks setting is not one that promotes
individuality but a camaraderie. However, when one wishes to rest
while others make noise, someone can come to this screened off
area of the barracks to get some much needed sleep. Lines of cots
dot this curtained off area. With a pang of intense sorrow and
futility you realize that if there is a raid or other such attack
tomorrow or the next day, many of these cots will be empty when
the garrison returns.

sport exits to either the keep or the city. This group of
soldiers have obviously just come in from the watch on the outer
walls and they look cold and hungry. Food and warm cloaks are
brought from other sympathetic men as the newly arrived watchers
try to make themselves feel human again.

Time and time again the stated goal of Fal Dara has been to
resist and that means a lack of adornment. Still you are
surprised to only find a stone at the heart of Fal Dara.

well fortified and well defended Keep. One of the traditional
weak points of a fortress, however, is the lack of a consistent
water source. Servants run in and out of the kitchen in the
southern wall, carrying buckets of water either full or empty
depending on where they are going. The entrance to the basement
of the fortress seems to be in the northern wall here and you
gather that the water source is down there as well, judging by
the full buckets of water being brought up from that direction.

made their report, and now are making a bee-line for the

you move closer to the wall to examine it closer. You observe
that although any human would not be able to emulate the Ogier
built cities and fortresses or indeed the power rot Stone of
Tear, man has made a conceded effort to encapture the sturdiness
of the structure. Intricately worked bricks inset into the wall
have been lovingly placed and martyred so that it would take a
very powerful force to break them down.

the head of which servants pass out plates of food. When the
soldiers receive their meals, they peal off to one side, find a
table and begin to dig in. You look longingly at the scrumptious
food being served and decide that if you want some, you better

instruments of pain are in evidence but you have the overpowering
feeling of being in a place of pain. You descend into what seems
to be a jailers office. A desk placed in the middle of the room
has what seems to be the jailers lunch resting on it's surface. A
large board filled with hooks on which keys dangle, is obviously
the board that contains the keys to the individual cells. The
jailer himself sits at the desk, seemingly the one who has just
finished the lunch on the desk.

them new orders straight from Agelmar himself. Fires stoked up in
the fire place as well as the large carpeted floor allow the room
to retain the heat and give it a much more comfortable air.

though you can see some form of lightweight wood in the center of
each beam, forms a massive bridge that connects the second floor
of the Keep, with the Keep's walls. Thus, if the walls need
reinforcement,, soldiers can come out from the keep, directly to
the walls and in no danger of attack.

Only one tapestry hangs here, covering an entire wall and showing
men, armored like the men of Fal Dara, fighting Myrddraal and
Trollocs in a mountain pass. A table, one chest, and a few chairs
are the only furnishings except for two racks on the wall, and
they catch your eye as much as the tapestry. One holds a
two-handed sword, taller than a man, a more ordinary broadsword,
and below them a studded mace and a long, kite-shaped shield
bearing three foxes. From the other hangs a suit of armor,
complete and arranged as one would wear it. Even here, at the
heart of the Keep, armor and weapons are at hand, like the
furniture, simply and severely decorated in gold.

the hall, filling it with a kind of joy which is a marked

similar to the ones to your north indicate more studies for the

light through the
halls. A hallway, lined with double doors stretches 
as far as the eye can see, Similar to the third floor. A
marked difference from the third floor, however, are the lack of
guards stationed at doors. This seems to indicate less need for
protection which is probably true seeing their must be
more than a hundred soldiers between this top floor and the

Talk of not much  other than this fact has spread throughout the
city, lending confidence to people weak with fear. The defiant
hawk of Shienar seems to scream out with hatred for the Shadow as
it faces northward. It almost seems like the banner made with
cloth fine as silk, could stop the Shadow cold in  fear as it
advances south.

      <roomdescription>Large steel supports reinforce the large northern gate that is the first
stage of defence of the city of Fal Dara.  The gate which spans the gap
between the outer wall is a monstrous contraption consisting of mainly
metal and supporting metal.  The gate has to be at least twenty feet high
but the outer wall easily doubles the height of the gate.  Guardhouses
located just within the gates sport the elite of the soldiers guarding the
city, stationed here to spot any attack far off.  Looking northward a
large grassland spreads out before the city, but the glory of the clean
grounds and the sun shining down is dimmed by the mental image of
thousands of Trollocs camping outside, ready to crush the world.

      <roomdescription>The ground here has been hacked at to clear away all forms of
growth, higher than a foot, so that no obstruction blocks the
view north from the city. The large black hawk flying on the
banner of Shienar, waving from the highest towers of the city to
your south, is heartening, giving off a strong feeling of steely
determination. Large gates, guarded by mounted soldiers, look
impressive with their strong steel supports, looking like they
wouldn't crack under a normal ram.  The ground clearing spreads
far to your north, serving to provide the city with plenty of
wood but also for an obvious military reason.

Curious as to why wagons would be travelling northward from the
most north of cities in shienar, you stop a guard of the wagon to
ask the question. The shienaran Soldier tells you that they are
taking supplies to a borderfort.

The ground lying underneath the soft outer layer, is hard and

Shadow. A fortress to the north surrounded by a large wall, is a
comforting sight in this barren wasteland.

      <roomdescription>a large wall surrounding one tall building spotted through the
gates of the wall, takes up most of your vision to the north.
Military tactics generally state that leaving an enemy fortress
behind a marching line is a very bad idea, due to the real risk
of being hit on two sides. Thus, even though this fortress stands
strong in the direct path to Fal Dara, it would not be ignored by
a Trolloc advance. Every person you see through the gates is
either a soldier or a servant, but before being able to observe
more, the guards block your path.

enclosed space takes up the majority of the room inside the wall.
One tall tower reaches up into the sky, the banner of Shienar
flying atop the tallest spire. Soldiers and servants run about on
their assigned tasks, preparing for a patrol or for the return of
a patrol. A Group of 30 soldiers stand near the southern gate,
talking quietly with one another. Not understanding the customs
of this borderfort, you can still gather that these soldiers are
the patrol about to be sent out upon the return of the currently

as well as, troops on foot, dot the yard in groups of 30's and
40's. The field seems to have been split in two parts, the
southern for the men on horse, while soldiers practice afoot,
with sword and in hand to hand combat to the north. Judging by
the age of the soldiers and the way they move separate from the
main body of men, they seem to be officers in charge of each
individual grouping.

      <roomdescription>The heavy sound of steel shod hooves sets off a reverberating
motion in the ground you stand upon. Men on horseback, in
groupings of 30 or 40 dot the field, an officer or two in charge
of each group, motioning to perform specific tasks. This section
of the horseback part of the practice yard seems to be devoted to
soldiers who have had battle experience but wish to hone their
skills to a fine edge. Dropping lances in to attack position, a
group of horsemen thunderously charge forward, depositing their
lances in wooden targets and peeling off with expert precision
for the next wave of riders to begin their attack run.

horsemen practicing in this area that seems devoted to skills on
horseback. Instructors, teaching maneuvers like how to use an axe
best while riding or how one can use their shield to best
advantage when not on the ground, work one on one with soldiers
or teach them in small groups. The soldiers in this part of the
yard seem less experienced than the ones eastward, and you gather
that to the west, the untested and still training soldiers are
learning the rudiments of their selected profession.

      <roomdescription>The thud of a body hitting the ground with bone crushing force
makes you wince in sympathy as you approach the southwestern part
of the practicing yard. The young soldier seems to be alright,
being able to stand on his own, with a little help from his
friends. The author of his unceremonious fall seems to have been
his newly trained warhorse whose armor plated sides and steel
shod hooves would make quite a mess of his new rider if the horse
had a chance to get near him. Most soldiers need to have very
intimate relationships with their horse, being able to trust them
in every situation, most of the time with things as important as
their lives. therefore, training them is quite a problem for new
recruits.

Accomplished soldiers recognized for their skill with the blade fight one
or two opponents, managing to fend off all their average strokes with a
modicum of ease.  These soldiers must either be close to Blademasters or
the average soldier in the garrison fairly ill trained because if one good
blade can take out two with ease, there is a problem.  Still, everything

these soldiers must be fairly new to the fighting force stationed here.

      <roomdescription>The sound of wooden blade hitting skin is not a pleasant one and
the soldiers seem to be sharing that sentiment. A little humility
is necessary for the body of an army and humility is being doled
out in large measurements on this portion of the practice field.
Large soldiers, with wooden blades bared for battle, pick
opponents from the group of gangly recruits muddled around in a
big group in the center of this section. The lesson in humility
begins as soon as the new levy is told to try and strike his
opponent. It does not take long for the young man to be stinging
on the ground, hurting from multiple whacks with the wooden
blades of competence.

steeds, prance about the yard, uncaring who they trample in their

turns out to be more dangerous than standing on the ground for a

seige, but to identify the enemy, attempt to route the enemy and
if that failed, to retreat to the stronger city to the south.
Large tables can be spotted to the north of you, illuminated by
large fires stoked in the corners of the room. That must be the
mess hall where the soldiers living here take their meals. A
stairwell to your west seems to only go upward from your current
position. Between you and the fire lit room at the end of the
hall to your north, is a door lined corridor, looking plain and
efficient.

curling white smoke from the west, backdropped by the evening

Dark shapes, large but undeterminable are in a group around the
fire, taking warmth from it. big creatures, massing large, move
about the camp, unrolling bedrolls or eating or stoking up the
fire. A shape splayed out on the ground near  where you crouch,
catches your attention. It seems to be a dog that is missing a
throat. A smear of blood almost invisible in the darkness, leads

trying to get an assessment of the size of it. Large groups of
shapes, dim in the moonlight, are difficult to put a number too
but from the size of the fire, the camp could possibly hold over
a hundred. Getting a closer look at the shapes crowding around
the fire, a shiver runs up your spine as you recognize Trollocs.
With the illumination provided by the fire, you spot a large
caldron strung across the fire pit, cooking some unnamable beast.
The harsh voices of the trolloc dialect shatter the stillness of
the night as you try to decide what to do.

      <roomdescription>Flush with the ground, trying to conceal your presence in the low
bushes, you crawl carefully into the southeastern corner of the
encampment. Where ever Trollocs go, Myrddraal are necessary to
keep them going in the right direction, and you've managed to
find the commanders tent of this group. A black robed figure,
sitting in shadow, stares out beyond the encampment to the south.
Freezing in place and digging fingers into the ground to hold
your position, you wait to see if it is safe to move.

      <roomdescription>Caring nothing for the dirt and grass getting into your equipment
and clothing, you try to stay as inconspicuous as possible. Huge
shapes surrounded in darkness, move about the encampment, while
the majority of the troops sleep. Wondering why you did not
encounter a sentry blocking access to the encampment, you realize
that the centry is standing not three spans away from you.
Looking out from the camp, he or it does not seem to realize
you've entered. An inhuman blend of animals mixed with human
stock is the result of these debauched creatures so it is
necessary to move stealthily for the range of smell and hearing
of this evil spawn is unknown.

dirt smeard on face and hands, you try to stay unnoticed though
it is a pitiful attempt. If a Trolloc noticed the presence of
someone dressed in this fashion, at least two feet shorter than
the average Trolloc, they would know at once the situation.
Having spotted the beast roasting in the pot from far off, you
get a closer look at the actual shape as you move closer to the
fire. it is a human, not an animal that cooks away merrily.
Before choice pieces of skin and sinew is burned, the Trollocs
use sticks to pick the pieces off and eat them, while the bones
blacken and break in the hot fire. Stomach roiling with the
sickness of these abominable creatures, you cannot stand to hide
in the shadows any longer. Bringing weapons to bare, you decide
to fight for your life.

Bed rolls with large pig-like faces poking out of the ends lie haphazardly
all over the ground interposed between piles of rusty equipment and amour,

predictably, bigger clubs with spikes.  The occasional sword or pike is
visible between the bedrolls, but this rabble appears fairly disorganized,
keeping a cluttered camp with little sense of order.

the large tent set up directly northwest of the main camp fire.  The black

north, their posture suggesting one of attentive listening and readiness -
they seem simultaneously as still as statues, yet primed for action.  
Beneath their hoods the faces of the Eyeless are almost completely

in a hallway, with doors lining both sides of the corridor.
soldiers lounging, talking with one another, glance at you
curiously, wondering where you came from. Hilts of blade strapped
to their backs poke over their shoulders, evidence of their skill
by the care they give those weapons. Surcoats of varying colors
cover cloaks and armor made of good solid steel and leather.

      <roomdescription>Years before, the blight was a quarter hours ride from the
northern wall of this fort but now, as the Blight marches south
into the lands of living things, it is practically on the
doorstep. Decaying vegetation whipping with evil purpose, wraps
around small animals, bringing them to hidden mouths. All these
things can be seen from the walls now that the blight is so
close. Buildings to your east and west, sit just inside the
walls, people going in and out of them constantly. The entrance
to the main tower is south of where you stand, double doors
thrown back in welcome.

the structure this woodsmith needs. Two very large piles of
wooden polls, one cut around two spans long and nicely smoothed
with iron sharpened tips, the other pile clearly new felled
trees. An interesting invention this smith has come up with, a
long steel pipe, hollowed out and the rim thinned to an extremely
sharp tip, has been suspended in the air. A crank on the side of
the contraption allows the smith to turn the pipe when necessary.
Clearly, the smith places an uncut felled tree in the pipe, and
uses the pipes wickedly sharpened edges to trim off the worst of
the contusions from the wood. The smith then turns the crank,
turning the pipe and allowing the poll, newly smoothed to slide
out the bottom of the pipe into a rack where an iron tip is
placed upon the end.

Before answering the inquiring gaze of the man, you take in the

      <roomdescription>the clear blue sky along with the brightness of the sun combines
to lend a crystalline clarity to the day. The lack of clouds in
the sky preventing hot air from escaping, makes the day even
colder if that is at all possible. Greenery surrounding the road
sits thick along side the road, barring passage anywhere beyond
fifty feet. An often travelled road connecting Fal dara to the

      <roomdescription>covering mile after mile of grassland, this road stretches out as
far as you can perceive. Learning the approximate distance
between Fal Moran in the south, to Fal Dara in the north, from a
guard on a merchant train, you gather that you are about a third
of the way from Fal Moran, Fal Dara unseen far to the north.
Ruling in Fal Moran, King Easer seems to be clamping down on some
disturbing activities blamed on a male channeler or some
Shadowspawn lurking somewhere. Problems in the Borderlands are
always blamed on such occurrences for the dangers are quite
real.

stretches out before you, and to your sides, wide enough to allow
fifty men to ride abroad.

      <roomdescription>a patch of ground has been recently fired, nothing remaining of
what lay here before the fire. Judging by the condition of the
land, a large battle was fought here within the last two or three
years, the size of it being judged by the area of destruction.
Still, the land should have been able to heal itself before now
and thinking about the secrets that the army of the dark
possesses and of the equal amount of secrets possessed by groups
like the Aes Sedai, it wouldnt' be surprising if some form of
power was used to burn these creatures to cinders.

      <roomdescription>A rock wall, jagged in it's height, stretches high above the gap,
pillars of rock twisting and bending in odd shapes. Nothing is
normal about the lands of the Blight and beyond, so it shouldn't
be surprising if the mountains guarding the blight in this area,
did not apply to the natural laws. Thin layers of gravel lye in
the gap, though efforts at clearing the gravel away have been
made. Judging from the height of the mountain, boulders must
crash down, to break into millions of pieces and thus the gravel
is spread across the pass. for the heavily horse dependent forces
of the Borderlands, this could be a costly disadvantage.

mountain pass. Scorched earth mark past conflicts, being so
numerous the grass has been uprooted and no life remains here.
Good footing seems certain as most of the gravel falls near the
walls and not out into the center of the pass. soldiers sick with
conflict to the point where picking up the enemy dead or weapons
did not occur to them, allowed some of the weapons to be left
here. Deadly looking barbed spears, former black blades of a
Myrddraal turning a greyish color at the lack of refreshment,
huge war axes wielded by arms as thick as tree trunks, all these
have been scattered throughout the pass, the bodies of their
wielders gone to dust.

      <roomdescription>rock walls sporting jagged pikes of stone poke out from the sides
of the pass, sharpened points dangerously painful if one was to
draw to near them. Looking like some demented beast with stone
teeth, someone perverted enough to be a Trolloc or Myrddraal, has
taken the time to fashion a large piece of rock into the head of
a beast of some horror. the jagged pieces of stone that you
immediately took for sharpened teeth are the jaws of the beast,
looking horrid and terrifying. A fine coating of gravel covers
the floor of the pass, evidence of frequent land slides.

      <roomdescription>One object on this eastern part of the pass escaped the terrible
destructive fire that seems to have totally consumed the army of
the Shadow. a hand, formerly wearing what seems to be a black
glove has been fused by fire to a grey looking sword. Examining
the blade, you wonder  at it's color, but recalling some story
from memory, you understand that this must be what weapons made
in thakander look like, when they haven't been renewed. Touching
the hand, you feel it jerk under your touch. Drawing back in
amazement that something like a Myrddraal's hand could still have
some sort of reaction after such a length of time, stuns you.

Trees, thick as if there was literally a wall, crouch before you,
twisted and contorted into shapes unequalled in your experience
anywhere else. Trees, living animals, even the flowers on the

devoted to killing anyone who enter their domain. A subterranean
hum starts under your feet, giving you a tingling feeling as you

armies of the dark. Having no prior warning of attack save
through noises and sounds made by Trolloc voices, a large force

Having spotted the beast roasting in the pot from far off, you

Before choice pieces of skin and sinew is burned, the Trollocs
use sticks to pick the pieces off and eat them, while the bones
blacken and break in the hot fire. Stomach roiling with the
sickness of these abominable creatures, you cannot stand to hide
in the shadows any longer. Bringing weapons to bare, you decide
to fight for your life.

others. Bed rolls with large pig like faces poking out of the
ends, lay haphazardly all over the ground, making for a very
messy camp sight. Stepping softly and avoiding the monstrous
things made of shadow, you manage to make your way to the center
of this grouping of bodies. Fixing eyes to the north, you thought
you just heard hoof beats as if a horse was running somewhere in
that direction. Heart filled with determination you decide to
leave this deathtrap and see what you can do about bringing
soldiers to obliterate this company of the shadow.

      <roomdescription>No Trolloc sleeps near this section of the camp and the reason
for this is the large tent set up directly northwest of the main
camp fire. The black silk of the tent seems to shimmer in the
dying light rippling with restless violence. two black robed
Myrddraal stand like statues facing north, their posture
suggesting one of attentive listening as they seem to be getting
instructions in some form of communication only known to them.
Breaking off their vigil they turn around to face you directly,
the eyeless gaze of both of them, like a spear through the heart.

      <roomdescription>Moving as quiet as a shadow, feet moving easily over the ground,
you move on to the eastern part of the encampment. Trollocs
wrapped in sleep lay in heaps on the hard ground, not seeming to
be affected by comfort or a lack there of. evil looking barbed
weapons, near to hand, rest near each trolloc, ready to be taken
up at a moment's notice. Trying not to break a twig and alert
anyone to your presence, you move on silent feet, through the
encampment.

      <roomdescription>Alien carvings on the walls, give off a reddish glow that sends
strange feelings through your being. Faint music, figures wrapped
in peculiar garments, walk foreign halls in images that suddenly
flood your mind. Glowing balls of energy bob in the four corners
of this huge hall, shedding an interesting counterpoint to the
reddish glow coming from the walls. Golden riches lie everywhere,
haphazardly scattered throughout the hall, seemingly unimportant
to the being who lives here. Female dancers, wearing few clothes
and displaying the lobeless pointed ears of the Elven race, play
instruments unrecognizable from your experience. A figure of
stunning magnificence, fully the size of a building, lies curled
upon the floor in front of a throne, upon which sits the Ruler of
this place. Judging from the stone made walls, this seat of power
lies under a mountain and the only connection between this hall
and the skies above, must be the huge shaft in the roof, a tunnel
that allows the dragon to grace the skies.

      <roomdescription>A large room stretches out before you, dozens of people rushing around,
carrying out the orders of their superiors.  Although the commotion is high,
there is an orderly and systematic way that the officials and soldiers perform
their assigned tasks.  However, this is under a surface layer or what seems to
be complete chaos.  The main administration area opens up into two other large
rooms, looking rather alike, with long rows of benches for soldiers or officers
to sit and take meals.  A closed door to the south marks another wing of the
Headquarters, while to the southeast is a forbidding, thick wooden door.

      <roomdescription>A thick oaken door opens upon a fair sized office, as offices go, dark wood
covering the walls and filling the airspace with a pleasant scent.  A massive
desk, rests in the center of the floor, a blotter, ink jar and quill, as well
as dozens of parchments, placed upon the surface.  Two chairs sit before the
imposing desk, while a more ornate seat, is reserved for the owner of the room.
The rest of the office is fairly plain, save for the desk and chairs, obviously
having been cleaned out recently.

      <roomdescription>A room slightly larger than a regular office, meets your gaze as you walk into
the War Room.  A large table dominates the center of the floor space, maps and
ink jars aplenty, marking the surface of the wooden tabletop.  Chairs have been
placed around the large map-table, surrounding it completely, room for at least
twenty officers and other brass, to take their rest.  Maps also line the walls,
a massive depiction of cairhien, spanning the west wall.  To the east, an oaken
door leads into a slightly smaller office, while the exit back to the
administration block, is to the north.

      <roomdescription>The room behind the locked door, is most likely the smallest room in the
headquarters, with very plain, unadorned white walls, and nothing upon the
floor save the wooden planks.  The only major obstruction to the monotony is
the plain but comfortable looking bed that rests in one corner.  A tray, used
to carry food, has been placed next to the bed, clean for the time being.  The
only other object in the room is a plain oaken chair, well constructed and well
kept, that rests against the west wall.  The only exit from this cell-like
room, is to the northwest. In addition, a fist-sized hole has been punched
into the north wall of the cell, the large indentation the only mark in the 
otherwise pristine walls.

    <roombasic title="The Clearing" vnum="23450" zone="230">
      <roomdescription>Thick trees surround this large clearing, their branches stretching up fully a
hundred or more feet into the sky, weaving an intricate screen of interlocked
leaves and bark, which effectively blocks any sort of view of the clearing from
anywhere outside of its secluded confines.  A small path leading up from the
south, is the only break in the monotony of the wildlife, branches still
needing to be pushed aside as even on this well- groomed path, they impede easy
passage.  The clearing itself could be a glen of the gods if it were not
clearly spread out before your eyes.  The sun kissed river that splits the
clearing and flows away to the west, shimmers by day with sparkling golden
light, while by night, its calm but steady running course, is simultaneously
soft and powerful.  A relatively small cabin placed about twenty feet from the
water, appears to be quite old but still well constructed, the aged wood giving
it a dignified presence, which is supported by the thin trail of smoke that
curls out of the chimney in the roof.

intricately carved wooden chairs and their depictions of the lion of Andor, to
the tapestries that hang off nearly every wall available.  A small table in one
corner, its mahogany surface smoothed by age,is clearly where the meals are
prepared and eaten, while a double bed in the opposite corner is obviously
where the current occupant sleeps.  A small fireplace in the northern wall,
provides some heat and illumination, casting the wooden confines in soft,
reddish light that shimmers slightly off the plush white and red wall-to-wall
rug that has been slung over the wooden floorboards.  A pair of fair sized
windows, look out on to the river so close to the outside of the cabin, while a
door in the southern wall, allows one to leave if they so choose.

a stylized depiction of the troops before the ugly conflicts, their banners
swirling in the breeze, the rose wrapped sword of house Taravin, always flying
near the Lion of Andor.  One other tapestry on the northern wall, above the
fireplace, is clearly of the royal throne room.  A woman kneeling before the
occupied throne for one reason or another.
