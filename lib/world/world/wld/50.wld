      <roomdescription>The Great Plaza is far quieter here, before the main entrance to the White
Tower, for only those who seek to actually enter come this close.  Deep,
broad steps lead up to the massive double doors leading to the Tower
Lobby, wide enough for twenty men to walk abreast.  The main part of the
building is constructed entirely of gleaming &amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We &amp;ws&amp;Kt&amp;wo&amp;Kn&amp;we&amp;n, Ogier-built, and
towers five hundred feet above the ground.  It is three hundred feet
across at the base and slightly narrower at the top, making it the
largest, grandest structure erected since the Age of Legends.  Wide gravel
pathways lead both east and west, deeper into the tower grounds, but tall,
intricately wrought gates of polished &amp;rb&amp;yr&amp;yo&amp;Yn&amp;yz&amp;re&amp;n bar them from public use.

    <roombasic title="The Great Plaza" vnum="5001" zone="50">
      <roomdescription>In the very centre of this city of legend stands the &amp;WWhite Tower of Tar
Valon&amp;n, the Tower itself standing three hundred foot tall and dominating
the skyline for miles around.  This Great Plaza, within the compound walls
yet separated from the acre's of glorious grounds by tall, elegantly
carved walls, is almost always bustling with activity and loud with the
call of merchants and shopkeepers, vying for position with those who come
to petition the Tower for aid and those who might seek training.  Almost
every nation in the land has emissary's here, and these too merge with the
crowd - everywhere but in a strand of ground several paces around the huge
steps leading into the Tower, to the south, where none but the bravest or
most desperate will tread.  The ground is formed of smooth flagstones,
&amp;ww&amp;Wh&amp;wi&amp;Wt&amp;we&amp;n and varying shades of &amp;Kg&amp;wr&amp;Ke&amp;wy&amp;n worn flat by the hundreds of thousands of
feet that have stepped here through the years - not a single one cracked
or chipped.  Ogier stonemasons crafted this plaza and the buildings which
decorate it, and the large fountain in its centre is equally as elegant
and graceful.

      <roomdescription>On entering the Tower it becomes obvious that the walls inside are as
&amp;Wbright white&amp;n as they are outside.  The floor, on the other hand, is
patterned by tiny tiles in different shades and tones representing each of
the seven Ajah's &amp;rc&amp;yo&amp;Yl&amp;Wo&amp;gr&amp;bs&amp;n, arranged in an ornate pattern that seems to run
throughout most of the Tower building.  To the south of this section of
the hall lies a huge, open chamber, the walls lined in graceful archways -
its greatness can only be guessed at, but the domed, elaborately carved
ceiling is amazingly held aloft without a single pillar or support beam.
Many people are in the Hall, merchants nobles and common folk like,
awaiting the attention of hurrying girls in dresses of pristine white.  
Older girls in dresses of rainbow-banded white traverse the chamber too,
and women bearing the regal, ageless look of Aes Sedai - occasionally
accompanied by hard, stone-faced men.

the only part of the building they will ever see - only those accepted for
training or given sanctuary are allowed linger for more than a few hours.
The &amp;rs&amp;yp&amp;Yi&amp;Wr&amp;ga&amp;bl&amp;n of multicolored tiles on the floor continues here, worn smooth
through the ages but still bright and always spotlessly clean.  High
above, the ceiling is carved in intricate patterns depicting vines and
leaves, intertwined with the age old symbol of the Aes Sedai, all shaped
with the majestic flawlessness that only Ogier stonemasons can achieve.  
The building is as regal as a palace, but its inhabitants give it a
distinction beyond that of any noble mansion.

      <roomdescription>The sounds of training are louder here, and as the tree's thin the source
of the noise becomes visible - men of all ages, builds, nationalities and
classes training with lathes, and occasionally naked &amp;Ksteel&amp;n.  Some are
stripped to the waist, and others cloaked in an eye-wrenching, &amp;Ws&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wm&amp;Wm&amp;we&amp;Wr&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg&amp;n
material which makes them seem somehow to fade into their surroundings,
becoming nearly invisible at times.  The training grounds stand to the
east, the trees thinning to form a huge clearing, and the path stretches
back towards the west, through the thick forest.

      <roomdescription>The path ends here in a wide clearing, the ground perfectly flat and
packed to a hard, solid surface by centuries sparring students.  The
smooth surface stretches out towards the north and east where the grounds
are sectioned off into smaller practice yards and training rings.  There
are almost always groups of men training here, alone, in pairs, or as part
of larger exercises, most wielding &amp;ywooden&amp;n lathes rather than bare &amp;Ksteel&amp;n -
some stripped to the waist, sweating in the uncomfortable heat, others
wearing battle armour, or simply the eye-wrenching fancloth cloak which
marks their trade.  Only a few &amp;yt&amp;wr&amp;ge&amp;ye&amp;ws&amp;n are scattered through the training
grounds to offer shade from the glaring sun, and there are no benches -
spectators must stand, or sit on the few patches of shortly cropped grass
that surround the trees.  The men - and occasionally women - who train
here come from all parts of the land, from as varied backgrounds as can be
imagined, yet they are alike in that they all seem to be focused solely on
their training, and on earning their places amongst the most accomplished
swordsmen in the land.  Much farther north, the training grounds have been
taken over by a construction site, for what will soon be the Amyrlin's new
palace.

      <roomdescription>What was once an extension of the Tower training grounds is now a
fully-fledged construction yard, the ground cut to form the foundations of
the Amyrlin's new palace.  In some places the foundations have already
been set, and the real work of building has begun, &amp;Wwhite stone&amp;n drafted
from across the land carved into blocks, architects planning features to
make the palace a wonder.  Although it's only in its early stages, it can
already be seen how grand a building the palace proposes to be - not quite
as graceful or phenomenal as the Ogier-crafted Tower, but still a
masterpiece.  Right now, unfortunately, it's &amp;Kdu&amp;ys&amp;Kty&amp;n, thick with churned
&amp;Km&amp;yu&amp;Kd&amp;n, and busy with overworked builders.

      <roomdescription>This section of the grounds, once a large sparing ring for the Warders, is
now a teeming construction site.  In some places the foundations have
already been set, and the real work of building has begun - the cutting
and dressing of stone, the erection of scaffolding and supports.  
Although it's only in its early stages, it can already be seen how grand a
building the palace proposes to be - not quite as graceful or phenomenal
as the Ogier-crafted Tower, but still a masterpiece.  Near the southern
section of the yard, the ground has been smoothed flat enough to hold a
massive board, atop which is built a huge model of the future palace -
tall enough for the architects to actually crawl inside, for better
detailing.  From the plans, it seems Elaida intends to make this place
taller than the &amp;WWhite Tower&amp;n itself.

very good for sparring unless someone slips or takes a fall - in which
case they could seriously injure themselves.  No rack of practice swords
graces this small, circular arena, only large enough for four or five
people to spar in, for this is where the swords masters the Tower practice
their arts, using naked &amp;Ks&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;we&amp;Kl&amp;n, flesh and anything else they might bring to
hand.  After two masters match steel here at least one of them, more
commonly both, need the attentions of a skilled sister of the &amp;YYellow Ajah&amp;n,
or at least a few day's rest.  Even when there aren't spars being fought,
this place is often used for the practicing of forms, to hone balance and
coordination - if one can ignore the sounds of building, coming from the
construction site to the north.

      <roomdescription>This is a slightly more difficult sparring yard to use than most of the
others - the ground here has not been cleared completely of all the
natural obstacles that one might see in a forest, or on a road.  There are
some fist-sized &amp;Kstones&amp;n scattered about the ground and even a few fallen
logs, body-thick - here the trees aren't quite as sparse, with low hanging
&amp;ybr&amp;Ka&amp;ynch&amp;Ke&amp;ys&amp;n to block sword thrusts and trailing roots to hinder pretty
footwork.  This place was made for the students to fight in more realistic
conditions, which they might one day face on the road, and as such there
aren't as many students here as there are at the other practice yards, for
not many enjoy sparring on the rough, uneven ground.  This place might be
useless for the practicing of forms, but as an arena for skill-testing,
its worth is easily apparent.

sound of bird song.  The distant bulk of the White Tower is visible rarely

      <roomdescription>The grand staircase continues to spiral on up towards the higher levels of
the Tower, but this floor seems to be the destination for many of the
women.  The floor here is decorated by tiny square tiles, each smaller
than an inch in size and ranging in different shades through the colors of
the seven Ajahs - smoothly flowing patterns, perfectly placed and not a
single one chipped or broken.  The &amp;Wg&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg&amp;n white stone walls are adorned
only sparsely, and the huge arched windows provide more than enough light
to banish all hint of shadow.  Northwards, the hallway leads to a large,
open chamber, from which lead seven other corridors, evenly dividing this
level of the tower into pie-shaped segments belonging to each of the seven
original Ajah's.

doors are heavy and &amp;Ko&amp;ya&amp;yk&amp;we&amp;yn&amp;n, carved with intricate patterns designed to
capture the eye - they lead to bathing chambers reserved for the Aes Sedai
alone.  Like the rest of the Tower, the walls are of Ogier-carved white
stone, and the floor is adorned in floortiles in a myriad of colors.

Ajah&amp;n - beside it, to the northeast, the &amp;YYellow&amp;n, and beside that, east, the
&amp;gGreen&amp;n.  Continuing around the circle towards the southeast lie the
chambers of the &amp;KGrey Ajah&amp;n, then a corridor leading to the Grand staircase
directly south.  Immediately to the southwest lies a hallway baring no
banner, nor are its corridors ever walked - once, it belonged to the &amp;bBlue
Ajah&amp;n, now in disgrace.  Those remaining are the &amp;yBrown&amp;n, to the west, and
the &amp;WWhite&amp;n, to the northwest.

      <roomdescription>The hallway stretches on in both directions, southeast back towards the
huge central chamber, and northwest towards the Hall of the White Ajah.  
Oaken doorways line this hallway, large and carved intricately in patterns
depicting vines and flowers, or complex symmetrical designs - each often
including, somewhere, the &amp;WFlame of Tar Valon&amp;n.  Golden lamp stands also
line the hallway, casting a flickering glow over the multi-colored tiles
making up the floor, and the ancient tapestries that adorn the stark white
walls.

      <roomdescription>This hallway leads through the section of the building inhabited by the
&amp;WWhite Ajah&amp;n, yet looks very much like any other hallway within the White
Tower, differentiated only by the fact that most of its occupants are
sisters wearing white fringed shawls, and indeed most choose to dress in
simplistic dresses of pristine white.  The hall is wide enough for several
men to walk breast, and floored in bright tiles, tightly fitted squares in
the colours of each of the seven Ajah's.  Wall hangings break the stark
whiteness of the walls, and &amp;yg&amp;Yo&amp;Wld&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;n lampstands are spaced at regular
intervals along the corridors, between the tall oaken doorways that lead
to the personal rooms of the White Ajah.

either the southwest, and the Hall that once housed the &amp;bBlue Ajah&amp;n, or
northeast, to the large chamber where all the hallways merge.  Once the
hallway was lit by glowing golden lamps, but now the area is left cast in
&amp;Kgloom&amp;n and &amp;Ks&amp;wh&amp;Ka&amp;Wd&amp;Ko&amp;ww&amp;n.  The floors are composed of shining, multicolored
floor-tiles which appear to have been left unscrubbed for several months.

outstretched fingertips for the sky with unerring lines and curves.  The

      <roomdescription>Here in the centre of the Plaza stands a large circular fountain, its form
a perfectly smooth teardrop carved from white stone - the ever-famous
Flame of Tar Valon.  &amp;cCr&amp;Cys&amp;Wtal&amp;Cli&amp;cne&amp;n &amp;Cw&amp;wa&amp;ct&amp;we&amp;Cr&amp;n bubbles from its tip, sheathing
it's shimmering curves in a rippling sheet of liquid, to then collect in a
broad circular pool at its base.  The statue itself is huge, standing over
twenty foot tall, but beyond this central area the trickling and gurgling
sounds of the water are drowned out by the hustle and bustle created by
those who move about the Plaza.  Several semi-circular &amp;Kgranite&amp;n benches are
spaced around the fountain, and this seems to be the only place in the
busy area where one can pause, and rest for a moment in the shadow of the
White Tower.  Over the walls and buildings enclosing the Plaza, the tops
of tree's can be seen - the extensive Tower grounds.  To the north, the
spindly spires and arching bridges that make Tar Valon so spectacular are
visible, on the other side of the gate leading back into the city.

      <roomdescription>In the very centre of this city of legend stands the &amp;WWhite Tower of Tar
Valon&amp;n, the Tower itself standing three hundred foot tall and dominating
the skyline for miles around.  This Great Plaza, within the compound walls
yet separated from the acre's of glorious grounds by tall, elegantly
carved walls, is almost always bustling with activity and loud with the
call of merchants and shopkeepers, vying for position with those who come
to petition the Tower for aid and those who might seek training.  Almost
every nation in the land has emissary's here, and these too merge with the
crowd - everywhere but in a strand of ground several paces around the huge
steps leading into the Tower, to the south, where none but the bravest or
most desperate will tread.  The ground is formed of smooth flagstones,
&amp;ww&amp;Wh&amp;wi&amp;Wt&amp;we&amp;n and varying shades of &amp;Kg&amp;wr&amp;Ke&amp;wy&amp;n worn flat by the hundreds of thousands of
feet that have stepped here through the years - not a single one cracked
or chipped.  Ogier stonemasons crafted this plaza and the buildings which
decorate it, and the large fountain in its centre is equally as elegant
and graceful.

history, the Ogier.  Even after thousands of years their workmanship is
still sound - soaring buildings and shops adorned with leering gargoyles
holding not a single chip or crack, tall, twisting spires reaching line
outstretched fingertips for the sky with unerring lines and curves.  The
glory of the plaza doesn't go unnoticed by those who tread inside its
shadow - merchants, soldiers, noble lords and even common citizens often
pause to stare in wonder at the magnificence of the shops and offices
here.  More dominating, however, is the massive white tower standing to
the south - more graceful still than anything seen in this, the greatest

resting nearby, with various texts and books and other scattered
miscellany to keep occupied the various peoples which can be found in the
area during the hours of daylight.  Occasionally, oohs and aahs can be
heard as men in their odd, shifting and wavering cloaks sleekly stride
through the area, seeming as they are to be walking death as the head
onwards, deeper into the White Tower.  Aes Sedai can occasionally be seen
as well, their serenely cool faces drawn into expressionless masks as they
move about, occasionally stopping to address certain petitioners which
seem to have caught their fancy.  Directly eastwards, is the Center of the
Tower Lobby, while both to the south and to the north are the opposite,
twin western corners of the Lobby.

the floor of this area, and while wanders tread across them, a certain
click-click can be heard.  This sound does not extend to the oft-times
lean, hard-eyed men who wander through, clad in their light-altering,
shifting and changing cloaks that assigns them the rank, Warder.  They
move about with fluid steps, their weapons seeming almost a live part of
them as they wander through on their ways.  Aes Sedai can also be seen
occasionally, serenly calm features held as their eyes flit about to gaze
amongst the various petitioners that can, at any time during daylight
hours be sitting here.  Directly westwards, the Center of the Lobby is

&amp;Kgrey&amp;n metal polished to a dull gleam and softened with &amp;Wpale&amp;n, plump
cushions.  The walls are formed of white stone, and broken on one wall by
a tall, broad &amp;Ks&amp;wt&amp;Ko&amp;wn&amp;Ke&amp;n fireplace and on the other by a sizeable window,
curtained in thin lace.  The back wall holds a series of eight portraits,
depicting each of the Amyrlin's through history who have been raised from
the Grey, below them set framed copies of a number of successful treaties
negotiated by Grey Sisters.  A few much softer, more comfortable looking
leather chairs sit near the fireplace, and a few more by the window,
facing out over the expansive Tower grounds.  Upon the floor in &amp;Kdark&amp;n and
&amp;wlight grey&amp;n tiles lies the ancient, familiar symbol of the Aes Sedai,
polished to a gleaming shine.

&amp;Wwhite&amp;n diamond shaped tiles, forming the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai -
the &amp;WFlame of Tar Valon&amp;n, on a field of gleaming &amp;rred&amp;n.  Paintings and
tapestries line the walls, mostly of prominent Aes Sedai from the Red Ajah
- those who rose to become Amyrlin, or helped bring down False Dragon's.
Small, delicate rosewood tables are scattered through the room, atop which
are souvenirs brought to the hall by one sister or another, from all
across the land.  Comfortable chairs are situated throughout the room,
near the tables, the small fireplace, or the broad window that looks out
over the gardens.  Most prominent of all, however, is a huge oval table of
polished rosewood, courted by over a dozen similarly made chairs, situated
in the very centre of the room.

      <roomdescription>The meeting place of the &amp;WWhite Ajah&amp;n is a high-ceilinged and spacious
chamber, the stark white walls softened by several &amp;Yv&amp;Wi&amp;Gv&amp;Wi&amp;Md&amp;Wl&amp;Ry&amp;n colored
tapestries and wall hangings, the wide bay windows often left open to
admit a cooling breeze.  The floor is formed of the same gleaming white
stone that comprises the rest of the White Tower, polished to a &amp;Wd&amp;wa&amp;Wz&amp;wz&amp;Wl&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg&amp;n
sheen and adorned in a few well placed, subtly colored rugs.  A large oval
table centres the Hall, rosewood carved in intricate, perfectly
symmetrical patterns - surrounding the vast table are over a dozen
similarly made chairs, softened by plump &amp;Wwhite&amp;n cushions.  Nearer the walls
are more private, relaxed meeting areas, a tall fireplace courted by a few
low, comfortable looking chairs, and deeply cushioned couches set around
small tables.

      <roomdescription>The meeting room of the &amp;yBrown Ajah&amp;n sisters seems just a little bit
cluttered.  A large table sits in the middle of the room, carved of the
&amp;Rh&amp;re&amp;Ra&amp;rr&amp;Rt&amp;yw&amp;ro&amp;yo&amp;rd&amp;n of an ancient tree, the familiar sign of the Aes Sedai carved
into its very centre.  Surrounding the table are several well-worn chairs,
that seem to have been carved from the same tree, then softened by a few
fat, overstuffed cushions.  Lining the far wall of the room are portraits
of the five Amyrlins that were raised from the &amp;yBrown&amp;n, placed above a small
fireplace surrounded by a few much more comfortable looking leather
chairs.  The other three walls hold book shelves filled with old books,
maps and even carved stones - a collection that can't possibly rival the
Library itself, but which holds slightly more obscure items.

      <roomdescription>This large room, where the &amp;YYellow Ajah&amp;n meet, is organised in an orderly
fashion.  Porcelain vases are placed strategically around the room to
provide maximal show, while tapestries of scenes such as a woman in a
&amp;YYellow &amp;Wf&amp;Yr&amp;wi&amp;Yn&amp;Wg&amp;Ye&amp;wd&amp;n shawl laying Healing hands on a man near death adorn the
walls.  The floor is tiled in a mosaic of the Flame of Tar Valon, &amp;Wwhite&amp;n on
&amp;Yyellow&amp;n to represent the Ajah.  The room is cool, a broad window often left
open to admit the gentle breeze, and a large bookcase containing texts on
Healing is at the far end of the room.  Chairs and lounges are arrayed
around the room to provide comfortable meeting areas for the Sisters, but
the most prominent table of all sits in the very centre of the room - a
long, elegant oval surrounded by over a dozen stiff backed wooden chairs.

      <roomdescription>While many sisters of the &amp;gGreen Ajah&amp;n choose to wear colors other than that
of their Ajah, the Hall intended as their meeting place was decorated in
accordance with it - the familiar shape of the Flame of Tar Valon is
formed in tiny &amp;Wwhite&amp;n tiles in the centre of the chamber, on a field of
&amp;Gv&amp;ge&amp;Gr&amp;gd&amp;Ga&amp;gn&amp;Gt &amp;ggreen&amp;n.  A large table is situated in the middle of the room,
surrounded by high backed, fairly comfortable looking chairs, but nearer
the edges of the room are more comfortable meeting places.  A few low,
well cushioned couches sit before the stone fireplace, and a few others by
the tall, broad windows that look out over the gardens.  Positioned
auspiciously on the far wall, easily seen from anywhere in the great hall,
is a testimony to two green sisters said to be the Archetype of their Ajah
- one is the portrait of Caraighan Maconar, the heroine of over a hundred
adventures that are recorded in the White Tower Library.  The other is a
small statue in memory of Rashima Kerenmosa, the Soldier Amyrlin who died
with no fewer than the corpses of nine dreadlords surrouding the bodies of
herself, and her warders.

from the Mountains of Mist in Andor.  The foyer's intricately carved domed
ceiling stands at least thirty foot high - the chamber is equally as broad
- yet not a single pillar or support beam holds its great weight.  
Strangely, the girls who walk here seldom seem to pay much attention to
their surroundings, hurrying to and from lessons and chores without much
more than a hurried glance at the all the grandeur.  A doorway to the east
leads to an office, which most of the girls seem to deliberately avoid
looking at, and south stands a hallway leading to separate parts of the

      <roomdescription>The hallway stretches on towards the south back towards the main body of
the Tower, but to the north stands a tall double doorway, the wood inlaid
with a silver teardrop, the Flame of Tar Valon.  &amp;yO&amp;Kak&amp;ye&amp;Kn&amp;n doorways line this
hallway, large and carved intricately in patterns depicting vines and
flowers, or complex symmetrical designs - each often including, somewhere,
that same Flame.  Golden lamp stands also line the hallway, casting a
flickering glow over the multi-colored tiles making up the floor, and the
tapestries that adorn the stark white walls.

polished to a dull &amp;Wg&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;n.  Golden lamps are spaced along the hallway at

doors, carved dark wood inlaid with an embossed &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n flame representing
the never forgotten &amp;WFlame of Tar Valon&amp;n.  Each pair of doors opens onto a
smooth straight ramp, stretching thirty paces long to the centre of the
chamber, each identical to the others.  A raised platform surrounds the
circular room, leading around the outer edge, fronted by steps leading
back to the floor.  Eighteen chairs are placed around the high platform,
in spaced groupings of three - once there were twenty-one, but those seats
once held by the &amp;bBlue Ajah&amp;n have been removed, and according to rumor,
burned.  Each remaining triad of chairs is decorated and cushioned in the
colour of whichever Ajah it represents, and similar coloring marks the
floor, where the tiny floortiles mark out a &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n flame surrounded by
widening &amp;rs&amp;yp&amp;Yi&amp;Wr&amp;ga&amp;Kl&amp;rs&amp;n of color.  The Amyrlin Seat itself joins the other chairs
on the platform, a heavy, ornate piece of work carved with intricate vines
and leaves.

arranged neatly in some sort of order on top of the desk, along with a pot
of ink and a quill pen.  The rest of the desk is relatively clear, and the
floor is tiled to represent the Flame of Tar Valon alternating in &amp;kblack&amp;n

worn the stole.  A tall broad &amp;Rf&amp;ri&amp;Yr&amp;re&amp;Rp&amp;Yl&amp;ra&amp;Yc&amp;Re&amp;n is built into one wall; fireplace
and hearth carved from &amp;yg&amp;Yo&amp;Wld&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;n marble from distant Kandor, and the floor is
formed of &amp;Wp&amp;wo&amp;Wl&amp;wi&amp;Ws&amp;wh&amp;We&amp;wd&amp;n, diamond shaped &amp;Rr&amp;re&amp;Rd&amp;Ks&amp;rt&amp;ro&amp;Kn&amp;re&amp;n tiles, brought from the
Mountains of Mist.  Tall arched windows leading to a balcony which
overlooks a small private &amp;Gg&amp;ga&amp;Gr&amp;gd&amp;Ge&amp;gn&amp;n grace the wall opposite - the doors are
seldom open.  The walls are panelled in &amp;ypale &amp;ys&amp;wt&amp;Wripp&amp;we&amp;yd wood&amp;n, hard as &amp;Kiron&amp;n
and carved in the intricate shapes of fantastic beasts and birds.  These
things have been in place since the room was first built, but each Amyrlin
brings furniture and decorations of her own - Elaida's writing desk is
immense, and before it sit a dozen wooden stools arranged in a perfect
semicircle.  The Amyrlin's throne-like chair is intricately carved, and
crested with an &amp;wivory &amp;WFlame of Tar Valon&amp;n, and above the fireplace stands a
sketched drawing of two men - one has a mouth and eyes of flame, and the
other is Rand al'Thor.

a vase filled with &amp;mfl&amp;co&amp;ww&amp;ce&amp;mrs&amp;n, their light scent filling the small chamber.
A soft downy comforter adorns the bed, its rich &amp;rred&amp;n color set off by the
white fluffy pillows that are scattered atop the bed's surface.  Along the
wall which holds the door rests a small washstand complete with white
pitcher and a large bowl.  A medium sized mirror hangs just over the

as if a hundred different mirrors are within both of their &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;Wy&amp;n depths.

exquisitely formed &amp;Wm&amp;Ka&amp;Wr&amp;Kb&amp;Wl&amp;Ke&amp;n globes, and a range of objects in between, and

burdens, and several are also tagged with &amp;yy&amp;wello&amp;yw&amp;win&amp;yg&amp;n labels, or set atop
piles of dusty papers.  There are no lamps lit here, and so light must be
provided by whomever decides to venture into the chamber - a rack of fresh

candlestand.

the properties and numbers of the objects stored here.  Each of the other
walls holds a shelf, and on these are hoarded the most powerful of the
objects saved from the Age of Legends - the Angreal.  Some are small and
simple, others more grandiose, most come as statues or jewellery, but one
thing they have in common is that they are all smooth and perfectly
formed, flawless.

      <roomdescription>This twisting pathway stretches roughtly towards the north, hardly more
than a rough gravel track.  It winds through the trees and groves,
tracking through the underbrush towards a distant clearing, and a pond -
if not for the occasional glimpse through the trees of the distant,
soaring &amp;Wwhite&amp;n building which gives this compound its name, this place
could easily be mistaken for some wild country park.  Even when the sun
shines brightly, it struggles to penetrate the shadows provided by the
thick trunks and bushy leaves of the paperbacks and elms, &amp;yl&amp;wea&amp;yt&amp;whe&amp;gr&amp;yl&amp;weaf&amp;n and
&amp;ge&amp;Gv&amp;ge&amp;Gr&amp;gg&amp;Gr&amp;ge&amp;Ge&amp;gn&amp;Gs&amp;n.

opens out into a broad clearing.  A large pond centres the clearing, at
least thirty feet wide and playing host to a variety of ducks and birds.
The chirpy, feathered inhabitants make their nests in the long reeds which
court the distant side of the pond, and the ground around the ponds edge
varies - in some parts soft and mushy, in others firm enough to easily
support weight.  A &amp;cl&amp;Ci&amp;Wqu&amp;Ci&amp;cd&amp;n gurgle indicates where a small brook enters and
leaves the large body of water, to disappear back into the &amp;Kmur&amp;yk&amp;Ky dar&amp;wk&amp;Kness&amp;n

vents built into the roof of the barn and a long path runs down its
centre, between two rows of horse stalls, leading out to the fenced yard
in back.  A man moves back and forth from a pile of &amp;wh&amp;ya&amp;wy&amp;n in the back of the

new.  Another man sits on a bench, oiling the leather straps and bridles
of the horses to keep them in good condition.

standing four spans high and only slightly less broad.  During the day
they stand open to allow free entry to any of the Tower's residents, and
by night they're bolted shut, to protect the priceless objects inside.  
The foyer is huge, the floor made of &amp;rr&amp;wo&amp;Ws&amp;we&amp;R-&amp;Ws&amp;wh&amp;ro&amp;Wt&amp;n marble and the building
itself made with the same painstaking excellence employed by the Ogier
stonemasons who crafted the rest of the White Tower.  The library is very
much open-plan, and from the foyer you can see up to the second floor,
where the main body of books are kept.  Wrought &amp;Kiron&amp;n stairways stand both
east and west, and there's a desk here where borrowed books are signed in
and out.

      <roomdescription>This long corridor extends from east to west, the stairwell at the eastern
end leading both up to the archives and down to the main library and the
lobby.  Rugs in shades of pale &amp;Kgrey&amp;n run along the centre of the wide
hallway, and thick &amp;yoa&amp;Kk&amp;yen&amp;n doors lead into smaller rooms - study chambers
and research rooms, as well as personal rooms for the sisters of the &amp;yBrown
Ajah&amp;n who spend most of their time here.  Interspersed between the doorways
are small alcoves bearing elegant statues, sculptures and carvings, both
ancient and modern.

      <roomdescription>This room is fairly small and simplistic, centred by a large round table
about which are placed a dozen deep-backed, comfortable looking leather
chairs.  The table is often home to books or scrolls, &amp;Kinkwells&amp;n and used
quills, but through the clutter you can make out the pattern on the table
top, the ever-present &amp;WFlame of Tar Valon&amp;n.  There's a large window on the
far wall, and a few tiny alcoves carved into the white stone to hold
light, for those discussions that run on into the early hours.

west towards a thick, sturdy looking &amp;yo&amp;wa&amp;yk&amp;K door.  There are alcoves carved
into the walls here, obviously intended for torches or power-formed balls
of light, but seldom are they lit - as if any who decide to traverse these
&amp;kdark&amp;K ways are more than capable of providing light themselves.  The white
stone walls are unadorned by tapestries or paintings, and are as stark as
the smooth stone floor which lacks any of the usual tiling patterns.  The
door to the west is unusual in that beneath the door handle there's a
small &amp;wiron&amp;K lock - this is one of the few rooms within the White Tower
where access is granted to a only privileged few.  &amp;n

pressured into discussing.  The lines of books, documents and folders
cover every wall from top to bottom, and every shelf seems to be extremely
overfilled - although there is some kind of order to the clutter, nothing
here is random regardless of how carelessly packed the area seems.  
Several shelves in particular seem methodically organised, and these
contain documents and books rescued from the time before the breaking,

candles, for the girls must either study by the daylight streaming in the
huge windows or provide light of another kind.  The sitting area overlooks
the lobby below, and to the south extends the library proper, rows and

actually rather warm - at one side of the pool &amp;Wc&amp;wr&amp;Cy&amp;cs&amp;Ct&amp;wa&amp;Wl&amp;n clear, the pond-bed
formed of smooth stones, at the other tepid, &amp;ym&amp;Ku&amp;yc&amp;Kk&amp;yy&amp;n, and actually rather
unpleasant.  The &amp;wr&amp;ge&amp;we&amp;gd&amp;ws&amp;n, &amp;gwe&amp;Ge&amp;gds&amp;n, and other wild plant life make some parts
of the pond treacherous to attempt, yet the further one goes towards the

Small, brightly &amp;Yc&amp;Co&amp;Rl&amp;Wo&amp;Gr&amp;Me&amp;Yd&amp;n fishes dart about the ankles of intruders, and the
wild birds and ducks that make this place their home don't take very

lacking the intricate design features shown on other gates throughout the
Tower.  Not quite as decorative as the others within the gardens, this
gate is quite obviously functional - the &amp;rs&amp;Rh&amp;yaf&amp;Rt&amp;rs&amp;n are thick and sturdy, the
hinges kept well oiled, and by either side of the structure stand several
Tower Guards.  Through the bars, the busy city of Tar Valon can be seen,
bustling with merchants and visiting factors, loud with the sound of
shopkeepers trying to promote their wares.

various intervals within the area, all the candles within them well tended
and lit, their flames flickering at every stray gust of wind, but a rich
illumination shines through the whole area.  Almost seeming to dominate
the room is a gigantic desk, courted by two stocky men.  Each of the men
have a rather blocky build, and stoney face, with eyes that seem to peer
into the soul of each customer.  Behind the desk sits a small, almost
delicate woman who looks up from her work at the entrance of each new
customer.

with those little vacuum ashtray thingies.  The vending machine in the
southeast corner carries all major brands of beer, and even Jamesons Irish
Whiskey, but that is Cappen's, so it would be wise not to drink all of it.
The machine on the east wall dispenses steaks and baked potatoes.  Feel
free to kick back and relax, take a break from being in character, and
read the idiocy on the board.  If you need anything, just ring the bell.
Your waiter will be along shortly.  A small glowing portal in the middle
of the floor leads back down into Randland.  Take a deep breath and let it
out slowly before you take that plunge.

      <roomdescription>This room is not oppulent in its size, instead it seems very efficient.  
It has its elegance, but it makes efficient use of the space provided.  A 
large window adorns the wall, and decorative cushions line the sill where 
one can sit to look out upon the garden. Strong shutters are easily closed 
when the weather turns for the worse, but otherwise on pleasant days, the 
windows are left open to allow the sweet fragrance of the garden to fill 
the room. 

On the same wall as the window are two pieces balancing across each side 
of the window. A small writing desk is on the right hand side of the 
window, simple in design but elegant in the richness of the finely polished 
rosewood that has been well cared for over the years. On the left hand side 
is a small table with a couple of chairs, it seems to be of a similar make 
as the desk taking into account the richness of the rosewood used on the set.

Opposite the window, is a small armoire, this piece more ornately carved 
and the natural colors of the cedar make it an eyecatching piece. A vase 
of some of the finest Seafolk procelain filled with freshly cut flowers 
decorates the top and adds to the simple elegance of the room.

On the wall opposite the large oak door that is the entrance to the room 
is centered a canopied bed. A dark mahogany wood, again showing the care 
it has been given over time by the rich luster of the finish rises up from 
the frame into four large posts that support the canopy. Fine linen draperies 
are drawn back to the four posts of the bed by burgundy silk cords. The 
feather mattress sits high on the bed, and any person of small than average 
stature would have to climb up into the bed.

in the heart of the Halls of the &amp;GG&amp;green &amp;GA&amp;gjah&amp;n. It is clear that she
demonstrates a predisposition toward &amp;cai&amp;wr&amp;Win&amp;we&amp;css&amp;n and space rather
than clutter and unnecessary decoration, there are few, choice, 
yet luxurious furnishings in her rooms, speaking to comfort as 
well as function. The room is slightly curved outward, testifying 
to the general design of the White Tower's walls, with a balcony 
toward the northwest that stretches along the outside of five arched 
windows that let in the &amp;Yl&amp;wi&amp;Wg&amp;wh&amp;Yt&amp;n. The windows are more &amp;Wg&amp;cl&amp;Wa&amp;cs&amp;Ws&amp;n doors that
look a seamless part of the graceful stone arches they span, hung 
with inner curtains of &amp;Wsh&amp;weer whi&amp;Wte s&amp;wil&amp;Wk&amp;n, and darker, outer curtains 
of floor-length &amp;gfor&amp;Ge&amp;gst g&amp;Gre&amp;gen &amp;Gs&amp;gat&amp;Gi&amp;gn&amp;n. A long, heavily-cushioned couch 
upholstered in &amp;bd&amp;Bar&amp;bk b&amp;cl&amp;Bu&amp;be f&amp;ca&amp;Bb&amp;bri&amp;Bc&amp;n rests near several cushioned chairs,
and a &amp;Wwhi&amp;wt&amp;We di&amp;wv&amp;Wan&amp;n, seeming as though it is the Aes Sedai's favorite
place to sit, rests in front of the arched windows. There are two 
wardrobes, one to either side of the door that leads into her bedroom, 
almost identical to each other, carved from a rich, &amp;rr&amp;ye&amp;rdd&amp;yi&amp;rsh w&amp;yo&amp;ro&amp;yd&amp;n.
Through the door, entering her bedroom, her bed faces the windows, 
though it rests against the opposite wall, the sheets of the softest, 
thinnest, &amp;Wc&amp;wr&amp;ye&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;w-colored&amp;n brushed wool, with &amp;bmi&amp;Bd&amp;bni&amp;Bg&amp;bht &amp;Bb&amp;clu&amp;Be &amp;bbl&amp;Ban&amp;bke&amp;Bts&amp;n and
lots of &amp;ggr&amp;wee&amp;gn-&amp;wst&amp;gri&amp;wpe&amp;gd p&amp;wil&amp;glo&amp;wws&amp;n. The bed itself is raised higher than 
normal from the ground, needing a small, carved wooden footstool for 
a person of average height to climb onto it with complete ease. There 
is a &amp;Km&amp;war&amp;Kb&amp;wl&amp;Ke t&amp;wu&amp;Kb&amp;n sunken into the floor on one side, half-hidden behind 
a wooden screen with intricate scrollwork, &amp;Yl&amp;wi&amp;Wg&amp;wh&amp;Yt&amp;n showing through the 
small holes shaped like ornate, curving &amp;rf&amp;Rl&amp;ya&amp;Wm&amp;Ye&amp;rs&amp;n. A dressing table 
with a large, circular mirror sits before one of the windows, with a 
&amp;Ksi&amp;wl&amp;Kv&amp;we&amp;Kr&amp;n brush and comb set resting on its smooth, polished surface. 
&amp;BP&amp;co&amp;Cr&amp;wc&amp;We&amp;bl&amp;Ca&amp;ci&amp;Bn &amp;cv&amp;wa&amp;bs&amp;Be&amp;Cs&amp;n on each side of her bed rest on high, small, &amp;rch&amp;Re&amp;rrr&amp;Ry&amp;rwo&amp;Ro&amp;rd&amp;n 
tables, filled with fresh &amp;cw&amp;yi&amp;rl&amp;Wdf&amp;cl&amp;mo&amp;yw&amp;ge&amp;wr&amp;cs&amp;n.

      <roomdescription>This room is of medium size, allowing it to be nicely heated in the dead 
of winter by the &amp;Km&amp;wa&amp;Wrb&amp;wl&amp;Ke&amp;n fireplace set in the northern wall.  Plush
carpeting of deep &amp;rcrimson&amp;n covers the floor boards, the color complimenting
the light &amp;Ks&amp;wi&amp;Wlv&amp;we&amp;Kr&amp;n of the walls.  A large picture window on the eastern wall
provides a breathtaking view of the well kept grounds of the &amp;WW&amp;wh&amp;Ki&amp;Wt&amp;we &amp;KT&amp;Wo&amp;ww&amp;Ke&amp;Wr&amp;n,
the seat set into the wall below the window is cushioned in &amp;kmidnight black&amp;n
velvet.  Directly across the room from the window is a bed large enough to
sleep two comfortably, the blankets made of satin the same color as the
upholstery of the window seat.  A matching set of tables, crafted of
&amp;rr&amp;Ro&amp;Ks&amp;re&amp;Rw&amp;Ko&amp;ro&amp;Rd&amp;n, sits to either side of the bed, several candles arranged
carefully on the smooth tops, adding a soft &amp;yg&amp;Kl&amp;yo&amp;Kw&amp;n to the chamber.  
Arranged around the room at various points are delicate &amp;Ks&amp;wi&amp;Wlv&amp;we&amp;Kr&amp;n vases,
freshly cut roses in a vibrant array of &amp;rc&amp;yo&amp;gl&amp;co&amp;br&amp;Bs&amp;n lightly perfuming the air.

      <roomdescription>The view from this room is breath-taking through fine &amp;Klace curtains&amp;n as it
overlooks Tar Valon and the &amp;ggarden&amp;n below.  There is a large four poster
bed of &amp;rcherry wood&amp;n carved with &amp;Rice peppers&amp;n and &amp;mice pepper blossoms&amp;n.  Upon
the bed is soft cotton sheets and &amp;Bblanket&amp;n with a thick &amp;bcomforter&amp;n for cold
winters.  At the foot of the bed is a large tooled &amp;yleather trunk&amp;n for
storage.  There is a cozy fireplace with a large beveled mirror above it.
A beautiful rug lies upon the floor with jewel colors depicting &amp;Rice pepper&amp;n
planting and harvesting.  There is a sofa and a couple of chairs and a
rocker all set with comfortable pillows edged in a nice yellow trim that
looks like &amp;Yg&amp;Wo&amp;Yl&amp;Wd&amp;n.  Upon a table in front of the sofa is a &amp;ksilver&amp;n tea
service.  Behind a silk screen that is painted like a &amp;ggarden&amp;n is a &amp;rcopper
tub&amp;n for baths.  Next to the tub is a low table for &amp;Bsoaps&amp;n and &amp;bbath oils&amp;n.  
There is a low bench for setting out clothing.  Above the copper wash tub
is a large round window.

    <roombasic title="Sholanna's Office" vnum="5207" zone="50">
      <roomdescription>This office is small and very neat, just big enough for the furniture and
doors.  A table, longer then it is wide, serves as the desk.  A wooden
armchair sits on the far side. A worn cushion in a &amp;csoft blue&amp;n on the seat
offers a bit of comfort in the otherwise spartan room.  The two &amp;ywooden&amp;n side
chairs across from the desk are &amp;rm&amp;yi&amp;cs&amp;gm&amp;ra&amp;yt&amp;cc&amp;gh&amp;re&amp;yd&amp;n.  They show the &amp;rdings&amp;n and
&amp;rscratches&amp;n of long use, but are still sturdy.  Theres a tapestry on the wall
over the side chairs.  A woman in a &amp;bblue dress&amp;n fights off &amp;Ktrollocs&amp;n with the
assistance of a man with a sword.  A few of the &amp;Bthreads&amp;n seem a bit brighter,
as if the tapestry has been repaired.  Theres a simple wool &amp;Br&amp;gu&amp;Bg&amp;n in &amp;Bblues&amp;n
and &amp;ggreens&amp;n on the floor under the table.  The only other furniture in the
room is a small bookcase behind the armchair.  Next to the bookcase, a
&amp;ywooden door&amp;n opens into an equally small sitting room and a similar &amp;ydoor&amp;n
faces across the room, though it is closed.  There is a window on the
wall to the north, over one end of the table, bathing the room with a
&amp;msoft &amp;Wl&amp;Yi&amp;Wg&amp;Yh&amp;Wt&amp;n during the daytime.

    <roombasic title="A small sitting room" vnum="5208" zone="50">
      <roomdescription>The sitting room is also small, but meticulously clean.  A &amp;gr&amp;Bu&amp;gg&amp;n almost as
large as the room covers the &amp;yfloor&amp;n.  It has an aged patina to it, but the
colors and pattern of &amp;Bblue flowers&amp;n and &amp;ggreen vines&amp;n on the &amp;ybrown background&amp;n
is still &amp;Bb&amp;Gr&amp;Bi&amp;Gg&amp;Bh&amp;Gt&amp;n.  Two &amp;Bblue&amp;n upholstered wingchairs sit by the small window
with a little bookcase between them.  It holds a beautifully &amp;Wc&amp;ya&amp;Wr&amp;yv&amp;We&amp;yd b&amp;Wo&amp;yx&amp;n, a
few books, and on top, a lamp rests for reading in the evenings.  There is a
settee across from the two chairs in a &amp;gsoft green&amp;n.  An armchair, much like
the one from the office including worn cushion, sits next to a &amp;ydoor&amp;n opposite
the entrance.  A tapestry of &amp;RCaemlyn&amp;n hangs over the chair.  Another tapestry
of what looks like the &amp;cM&amp;Ko&amp;cu&amp;Kn&amp;ct&amp;Ka&amp;ci&amp;Kn&amp;cs of M&amp;Ki&amp;cs&amp;Kt&amp;n hangs next to another &amp;ydoor&amp;n to the
north.

      <roomdescription>The door opens up into a fairly large room, that is mostly decorated in
hues of vibrant \c04blue\c00.  The bed has been pushed up against the middle of
the far wall, a soft crocheted comforter resting upon the pillowy surface.
Two rectangular pillows rest at the head of the bed and a large chest made
of \c01c\c03e\c01d\c03a\c01r\c00 rests at the foot.  The chest has a large padlock that is usually
left unlocked, as if daring anyone to try and open it and veiw the
contents.  To the right of the doorway, a loveseat rests in the corner of
the room with an oval shaped coffee table sitting before it on a blue
throw rug with golden tassles.  There are two circular tables that rest
upon either side of the bed as well, one holding a pitcher of water and a
wash basin.  That table also has a \c23m\c07i\c23r\c07r\c23o\c06r\c00 that hangs upon the wall with a
little shelf right below it to hold various containers and a bar of lilac
smelling soap.  Behind the door is a wardrobe that's doors sit slightly
ajar, showing the dresses and cloaks that hang neatly within it's
confines.  The aroma of freshly cut flowers fills the room with a subtle
odor, a small bouquet sitting upon the table on the other side of her bed
along with a few books that have white ribbons marking pages throughout
them.  Serveral shelves have been placed on the wall next to the wardrobe,
mostly covered with leather-backed books and papers that have been strung
together with strips of ribbon.  But resting on the ends of the shelves,
on either side of the books, are figurines of different woodland creatures
that act as bookstops.

      <roomdescription>&amp;cThe scent of &amp;Wjasmine&amp;c pervades the room, emanating from the two flowering
plants on either side of the &amp;ysandstone&amp;c fireplace.  A basket filled with
dried &amp;gh&amp;Ge&amp;gr&amp;Gb&amp;gs&amp;c sits on the &amp;yhearth&amp;c, adding to the &amp;ms&amp;Mw&amp;me&amp;Me&amp;mt&amp;c scents in the air.  A
soft carpet, woven with delicate shades of &amp;Gg&amp;gr&amp;Ge&amp;ge&amp;Gn&amp;c, &amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;c, and &amp;kg&amp;wr&amp;ke&amp;wy&amp;c, covers
the floor and there are two plush chairs resting in the corners of the
room.  The &amp;ym&amp;Ya&amp;yn&amp;Yt&amp;yl&amp;Ye&amp;c above the fireplace holds an colorful assortment of
scented candles, as well as a small jeweled &amp;kd&amp;wa&amp;Wgg&amp;we&amp;kr&amp;c in a &amp;ysheath&amp;c.  The
large, four-poster bed bears a thick, &amp;bblue&amp;c coverlet embroidered with
&amp;rheartsblush&amp;c flowers, and several beautiful handmade throw blankets are
strewn across it carelessly.  A small table with carved legs sits next to
the bed with a thin, &amp;yleather&amp;Y-&amp;ybound&amp;c book and a &amp;ks&amp;wi&amp;Wlv&amp;we&amp;kr&amp;c hairbrush on it.  An
number of narrow silk and velvet ribbons are scattered across the table as
well, and a single &amp;Rr&amp;ro&amp;Rs&amp;re&amp;c, dried and pressed carefully.  Through a narrow
doorway, a large &amp;Wporcelain&amp;c tub is visible.  The room is tiled in light
&amp;Gg&amp;gr&amp;Ge&amp;ge&amp;Gn&amp;c, and a round &amp;Wrug&amp;c has been placed next to the tub.  A &amp;ywooden&amp;c rack
against the wall holds thick towels, readily within reach.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>The moment the door to this room swings open, the visitor is greeted by
the warm invitation of a subtle incense, beckoning a welcome and alluring
the senses.  The internal area is lit by several wall sconces, scattered
throughout the room, and fashioned in the form of &amp;yg&amp;Yo&amp;Rl&amp;rd&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;n hawks in
midflight.  There is also a hawk on the floor of the room, stitched onto
an ornate rug in Shienaran fashion, so that it appears lifted directly out
of the nation's flag and placed onto a field of deep black.  The bird's
detail is flawlessly brought to life in &amp;ws&amp;Wh&amp;Ka&amp;yde&amp;wd &amp;Kc&amp;yol&amp;Ko&amp;Wr&amp;ws&amp;n and perfect
proportion, and appears rather opposite to the small &amp;Kt&amp;ka&amp;yb&amp;Kb&amp;ky&amp;n cat that can
usually be found stretched out upon it.  Natural light floods the room
from a pair of &amp;wg&amp;Wl&amp;wa&amp;Ws&amp;ws&amp;n doors, which look to lead onto a balcony, and are
draped in lengths of pale linen curtains.  The rest of the room is simply
decorated, bearing candles atop the surfaces of an armoire, dresser, and
central table that all seem to match each other, and there are also chairs
beside a comfortable looking couch.  A large fireplace breaks one wall,
and it's mantle is decorated only with candles and a small dagger in the
very center, their images all reflected in a great mirror overtop the
hearth.  There is another, more functional mirror across the room, lending
itself to use near a large &amp;wm&amp;Ka&amp;br&amp;wb&amp;Kl&amp;be&amp;n bathtub and an &amp;ro&amp;yr&amp;gn&amp;ca&amp;Bt&amp;be&amp;ml&amp;ry &amp;yp&amp;ga&amp;ci&amp;Bn&amp;bt&amp;me&amp;rd&amp;n screen.
Likewise the bed is shielded from the outside world, it's shelter made of
&amp;kda&amp;Krk-&amp;ksh&amp;Kad&amp;ked&amp;n and &amp;ksh&amp;Kim&amp;wm&amp;We&amp;Kri&amp;kng&amp;n silks that are no doubt an effective bar
against whatever light may attempt to interrupt the sleeper.  The most
detailed aspect, however, of this room is the web of warding that
surrounds it, for the eyes that can detect such things, of course...

      <roomdescription>You enter through the doorway which is adorned with a red Tairen silk
drapery, your eyes are drawn to the glowing candles placed around the room
in white three-pronged holders.  Following the red Saldaean rugs with
golden fringes, you glance around the walls and notice pictures of women
draped in a Red Shawls.  Two pictures stand out as above the others.  You
recognize them as Tetsuan and Bonwhin, the Amyrlins chosen from the Red
Ajah.  Another frame draws your attention towards a circle of thirteen
red-shawled woman surrounding a sulking man.  Obviously, there is a
ceremony being preformed in the picture.  As you stroll around, you notice
a tea-pot with several cups.  The scent is noticably Tremalkin tea, a
favorite of the Aes Sedai that inhabits this room.  A high canopy of
draped red curtains fringed with gold lace adorns the dark wood, four
postered bed, sheets of white and lace lap over its sides all around.  It
is made to perfection.  The small, dark wood desk enhances the east side
of the room, parchment , a silver quill, and both red and black ink wells
placed neatly on top.  Before leaving, you notice a small doorway to the
east side of the room.  Curiosity draws you towards it, yet you
hesitate...  Wondering what ward has been set around its hinges.

smooth oak desk int he center of the room.  The candle glows with a bright
&amp;Yg&amp;Wo&amp;Yl&amp;Wd&amp;Ye&amp;Wn&amp;n glow.  The window which once lay open to reveal the garden of the
White Tower has long since been enclosed by stone and now a large map of
the surrounding regions takes it's place.  In the far corner there is a
feather bed.  Wedged against the intersecting walls across from the bed, a
large oak closet holding Shianna's clothing and personal effects can be
seen.  Directly behind the desk, you can barely make out a large bookshelf
filled with books and parchments which have been neatly organized and
placed in a particular order.

instruments, bits of music and many books cover the shelves, a few
pieces placed out on a table near the window right next to a silver
music stand. In front of the window is a beautifully embroidered green
and gold window seat and looks like a very nice reading spot with just
enough light coming in the window during the day and a small lamp placed
on a stand nearby for reading at night.  A medium sized bed sits against
one corner, covered in a large cream and green quilt, light gold and
yellow embroidery decorating the edges. Thick, plush cream colored carpet
covers the entire floor, and comfy looking pillows and beanbags are
scattered all over one corner, just waiting for someone to lay down with
a book. Near the door is a small fireplace, with a tea kettle for
boiling water and a cabinet not far away seems to contain a selection
of various alcoholic drinks. The faint aromas of incense and freshly
brewed tea mix in the air, the flicker of numerous candles on a low 
table in the center of the room casting odd shadows about and adding
to the semi-mysterious, yet somehow relaxing atmosphere of the room.

the room in a rosy wash of light.  The wooden floor creaks when walked
upon, and a large rug covers much of the area before the desk, decorated
with the Flame of Tar Valon.  A large ornately carved rosewood desk rests
underneath the window, decorated with a variety of papers, quills, bottles
of ink, sealing wax and brass seals.  On a small table in the corner rests
a tea service with rose-shaped teacups and a silver teapot, a small jar of
honey to one side.  In front of the desk are two narrow, rather
uncomfortable looking hardwood chairs, but farther behind the desk lie two
rather comfortable chairs, probably only brought out for special guests.

globes.  The scent of leather and hold books hangs heavily in the air.  A
fire crackles in the stone fireplace, it's mantle carved black marble.  A
large leather sofa sits against the north wall between two ceiling to
floor bookshelves.  More of the same type of shelves cover the east and
west walls, the northern wall is carved out like an alcove.  A large four
poster oak bed is tucked into the alcove, covered with layers of burgundy
and gray comforters and pillows.  An oak wardrobe, it's doors carved
intricately with scenes of Fal Dara, stands to the right of the bed.  To
the left rests an oak dressing table, with a gray velvet cushioned stool
in front of it.  The brushes and combs are perfectly arranged on the
table, as are the books found on the shelves in the main room.  A pair of
leather chairs that match the sofa sit around an oak coffee table, a
porcelain tea set sits upon it.  A pile of fabric squares and what appears
to be a quilt in progress lies over one of the chairs.  Finished quilts
lie on the couches and chairs.  An oak desk is inset in the west wall,
opposite the fireplace, stacks of parchment, sealing wax, quills, and
various signet rings are neatly arranged upon it.  Oddly there are no
windows in this room.

of books, scrolls and papers in no recognisable order.  There's a large
&amp;rr&amp;Ro&amp;rs&amp;Re&amp;Kw&amp;yo&amp;ro&amp;yd&amp;n desk in the centre of the disarray with a comfortable looking
leather chair to each side, and the desk too is piled high with books and
&amp;yy&amp;we&amp;yll&amp;wow&amp;yi&amp;wn&amp;yg&amp;n scrolls.  Odd devices litter a bookcase near the far wall, in a
variety of shapes and sizes - most likely Ter'angreal of a harmless
nature.  The floor is of the same &amp;Wg&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg&amp;W white&amp;n stone that makes up the
rest of the White Tower, although very little of its perfectly polished
surface can be seen - the books stacked on the floor leave visible only a
vague path towards the desk.  If there's a pattern on the walls it's
impossible to discern - almost every available section of wall space is
covered by maps showing countries both near and far, some even decorated
with tiny pins to mark important locations.  Light is provided by a large
window on the far wall, and the only actual decoration in the room is a
carpet picture of a proud looking woman - Kirin Melway, Amyrlin Seat from
922 to 950AB, raised from the &amp;yBrown Ajah&amp;n.

      <roomdescription>Incredibly clean, this isn't an exceedingly spacious room but it certainly
could never be called tiny.  On the left hand side of the doorway stands a
fairly large &amp;yo&amp;Kake&amp;yn&amp;n bookcase, the top two shelves catering to an assortment
of potted &amp;Gp&amp;gl&amp;Ga&amp;gn&amp;Gt&amp;gs&amp;n - the rest play host to everything from books, papers,
and curious looking devices that could quite possibly be ter'angreal.  An
old, &amp;yy&amp;we&amp;Kl&amp;yl&amp;Ko&amp;ww&amp;ye&amp;wd&amp;n skull stands out particularly, shaped and horned like a
goat's, but far larger - trolloc, apparently.  On the right side of the
room there's a large desk stacked with numerous piles of papers and books,
an inkwell or two, and a few steel nubbed pens.  Sealing wax joins the
general clutter.  The far corner of the room is dominated by a low bed,
the sheets perpetually mussed, and the room is fairly &amp;Kdark&amp;n - there are no
windows, but carvings in the white stone walls intended for globes of
light.  A thick carpet woven with a teardrop pattern muffles any
footfalls, and the lock on the door is shiny and bright - it looks fairly
newly fitted.

A library or office of sorts, lined with neatly organized but very full
bookshelves against each wall.  Between the bookshelves displays of
weapons, some ancient and some modern, hang on the wall.  Each looks
meticulously maintained, as if they could be used today.  Under and behind
each display, seeming arranged by the era and age of the weapons, lie
carefully reproduced maps marking important battles.  They maps include
large countrywide displays of entire wars to incredibly detailed battle
plans.  The furniture is simple and comfortable of wood and leather.  A
large partners desk rests in the center of the room, neatly organized for
study and research.  Near the desk stands a cabinet with the wide flat
drawers designed to hold maps.  There are two different sitting areas
along one wall near the windows.  One holds a table ideal for studying
larger maps or holding small meetings.  Near the other window are two
large leather chairs with a table and lamp between them.  It looks to be a
comfortable nook to read in.  On the wall opposite the entrance, two open
doors lead towards two small-sized bedrooms.  The furnishings in both are
simple, but the one on the left tends to have a feminine feel to the
coverings and rugs.

Simple furniture consisting of bed, trunk, and wardrobe are all this room
contains.  Surprisingly though for all the stark lines of the limited
furniture, the bed looks very lush with its soft wools, silks, and
velvets.  Pillows are piled high in all shapes and sizes as if they are as
much a collection as an indulgence.  The rugs scattered on the floor are
much the same as the pillows, a usable collection of art.  On the wall
behind the door is a huge map of the entire known world.  Carefully marked
and labeled seem to be all the known battles of the current problems.  
Known sightings of the Dragon, what appears to be two groups of Aiel, and
movements of two additional men, a Mat and a Perrin are all carefully
labeled and dated.  New to the map seem to be a series of symbols across
the bottom, carefully labeled in pencil with dates and one word, Seanchan.

Simplistic would best describe the room you are in.  It is a tad small but
functional.  On the floor is a simple worn wool rug.  The rug runs from
the door to a sturdy wooden bed.  At the foot of the bed there is an older
looking dark wooden chest that probably contains blankets for when it is
cold.  In one corner there is a small table with a lamp on it.  Next to
the table is a comfortable looking chair, perfect for spending hours
reading in.  On the other side of the room from the chair are a small
wardrobe and a low rack that holds a few weapons, mainly swords.  On the
wall behind the bed there hangs a woven tapestry depicting an ancient
battle.  In the scene an armed man stands before an army of beasts
protecting a noble looking woman that stands behind him.  The room has a
definite masculine feel to it.
