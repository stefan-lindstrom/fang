      <roomdescription>The Taren River is a scary sight, wide and strong, rushing and roaring, much
too fast to swim across, and much too deep to wade across, when compared to the
springs that are in Two Rivers, this river is almost a sea in the eyes of the
people of the lower villages of Two Rivers.  The ferry is a extortion, but
given the reputation of the folk of Taren Ferry, for some reason, no one is
surprised at the steep toll that must be paid.  But the things that merchants
will do for that famous tabac and wool.  And the ale is not something to be

here to get to the tabac farms, but they do as little trade here as possible,
knowing that the folk are not to be trusted.  It is not that the people are not
friendly, although compared to city folk, they are more open, smiling and
waving, even if you are a stranger, but compared with the more polite manners
of the lower villages, there is a coldness.  One and all, the Taren Ferry folk
had a reputation for slyness and trickery.  If you shook hands with a Taren

chanting something about music, steel, and looking unhappy, as if they lost.
But no one can ever win at Foxes and Snakes. But the oddest thing of all is
the merchants counting the fingers on their hands, as if they wouldn't expect
back all four of their fingers, wait, why is there only four fingers?

Stonetower ringing faintly in your ears. These odd names, what sort of names
are those, really? These odd names that seem to have something to do with
stone or building. Perhaps these townsfolk were once workers from the
Mountains of the Mist. It explains their shady reputation. No one in Two
Rivers trusts those from Taren Ferry. There is something about their eyes,
glancing furtively as if to signal some hidden accomplice behind the
merchants brave enough to deal with these not so truthful villagers.

slightly perturbing. The especially high redstone foundations are a necessary
part of the houses, preventing the rooms from getting flooded every year when
the spring rains cause the Taren River to overflow. A soggy kitchen would be
most unpleasant, and no goodwife would tolerate cooking in such conditions.
Stairs lead up to each house, made of similar redstone. The sight is still odd,
but the stairs, as the foundations, are a necessary affection.

that cause the buildings to soar in the air, are still there.  It would take a
great amount of damage to shake these blocks of redstone.  However, after the
various Trolloc raids and the entry of the Whitecloaks, the buildings had been
in a bit of a shambles.  However, the folk of Two Rivers seem to be able to
land on their feet.  However, word has it that the people of Taren Ferry are
not quite on par with the rest of Two Rivers.  They mention the &quot;lower
villages&quot; as if they were some bad odor that clung to their nostrils and
refused to leave.  So you walk warily into the village of tall, dark houses.

Taern Ferry fell under the hands of Trollocs, and this town of strange people
shunned by all was at some point, months ago, lying in shambles. The ruins
were extensive, most of the buildings levelled to the ground. But now, all that
you seem to hear is the hustle abd bustle of a relatively large town, perfectly
normal sounds to be coming out of a village, especially one with a ferry for
a large river. It seems that the resillant Two Rivers folk have landed on their
feet and perservered. As usual, this should be of no surprise. The town lies
a bit ahead.

rare, since the people of Two Rivers enjoy their privacy and are farmers.  
Farmers need acres and acres of land to grow their crops, so naturally there
will be much space between the houses.  Each farm seems to have a wood barn for
the storage of feed and the animals when the weather is less than temperate.  
The houses are plain and yet sturdy, usually made of strong oak or elm, brick
being too expensive, and peat looked down upon.  These farms stil hang a bit
away from the road, as if to treasure their privacy.

there is something about the trees that add a soothing coolness to this bit of

line going from one point to another.  The dirt is packed tightly, but the dry
heat that has been plauging the land causes dust to billow in huge clouds
whenever a horse plods on at a slow pace or a lone traveller walks by
methodically along the path.  The random peeble offers faint gleams of blue,
gray and purple along the dun tint of the dirt.  Trees line the road, and
around the bend lies more road ahead.

      <roomdescription>The long and winding road lies in your path, leading to what maybe strawberry
fields, but given the weather, is probably just a stony, fallow field.  
Although, it all seems to be getting better, it's getting better all the time.
It can't get any worse, can it now?  From the corner of your eye, you see the
door of the house behind you open.  A man cries out ' Lovely Rita' and she's
leaving home it seems.  Her husband had gone out, fixing a hole, and he had no
lunch.  So packed in her basket is a wild honey pie, for him to feast upon.

      <roomdescription>The road comes to a hill, and from this natural vantage point the
village of Watch Hill can be seen quite clearly, the vague outlines
of the bodies of people hurrying to and fro to whatever work they have.
You wonder where the name comes from, this name Watch Hill. It
conjures up images of proud and stern soldiers with stiff and proper
posture, purveying the stretch of land from a hill that casts a shadow
over the land as far as the eye can see, perhaps even farther with the
aid of certain long lost instruments. But there is not much of a hill,
where Watch Hill is. It does seem slightly elevated, but nothing more.

odd reason. It's odd to know that no matter what happens in one's life, the
loves, the hates, the deaths, the joys, the terrors and whatever other ups
and downs you can think of, prosaic things like roads stay the same.
No, not odd, comforting is what the thought is. Almost like an anchor
along the way. Then again, this is only a short stretch of road that you
may never see again. You also wonder if all this profound pondering is
a result of rising at the crack of dawn with little more than thin gruel in
your stomacah to fortify you.

peering under leaves and bits of bark for acorns and other nuts that
they need to stay fat and sleek for days to come when the bitter cold
will force them into a deep sleep. However, now, they look for seeds that
are not there, the trees are barely alive, clinging to their dear lives with
their parched leaves and you wonder what will happen to the trees and the
squirrels? You reach your hand into your pouch, searching about, finding
a few bits of bread and small pieces of nuts. The squirrels munch happily
and they're full for now.

your eyes, the sun almost blidning you, causing brightly colored
spots to flood your sight, and for a moment, you close your eyes
to avoid the lights, and your vision turns red, a glowing orange red
that startles you, causing you to flail your arms around almost 
making you lose your balance, but you take a deep breath and stand
up straight. You can still feel the sun, the warmth, flooding around you,
almost overwhelming you with the heat. You wipe a bead of sweat
that trails down your forehead, following the curve of your cheek
and sigh. Will the unnatural weather end? Will the world ever be
normal? Will you stop asking yourself questions you can't answer?
Most likely not, for human nature rarely lets well enough alone.

eyes so you can see the long stretch of dusty road span before you.
It's odd, this North Road. After it passes through Emond's Field, 
it becomes the Old Road. You wonder what would posses someone
to do such a thing, switch the name of a road and confuse outsiders
for no good reason? Although, given how people's mind work,
sometimes even a so called loigical approach may be completely
arbitrary, so you might as well do things oddly. Nevertheless, you 
think that the name ought to have stayed the same throughout
Two Rivers.

it is not to say that the other villages of Two Rivers are shabby.  But there
is a clear inclination towards lines that cannot be denied.  The house too
stand in neat straight lines, with all the gardens in neat rows, with even the
borders of the dirt paths relatively straight, as if drawn by some giant plow.

is a mess.  Clothes thrown all over and armor and weapons lying around.  
None of it is in good shape.  This stuff isn't even worthy of a poor man.
And the smell makes you wanna run out of the tent.

      <roomdescription>The town of Watch Hill lies ahead, but your thoughts are otherwise
occupied with other things. Well, mostly with the soft sunlight that
warms your face, the faint breeze, well the faint breeze that you wish
would brush the strands of hair near your face, so you use your fingers
to emulate the wind instead. The faint odor of trees and moss hang
heavily in the air, with a dry musty note to it that strikes you as a bit
odd, but it is not unpleasant. You kick a stray pebble and it scuttles
about in a most amusing way. You walk quickly after it and continue
to play with it as you walk out of this bit of road.

grumble something about the unnatural weather and wonder if it would
be wise to do so. That infamous woman, The Wisdom of the village may
find you and take that ear of yours and box you. The odd weather has

custom dictates, the village green is a level green field, and is used
for various purposes, a meeting place for both adults and children, to
gossip and discuss matters of business. Or a place where children
meet to giggle and at each other and plot their pranks behind the very
backs of their victims. During Bel Tine, the pole covered with lovely
\c05r\c06i\c07b\c05b\c06o\c07n\c05s\c00 that the young women twirl around in a merry dance to enchant the 
young men who are naturally already enchanted with them. But the 
Green serves other equally important services besides what some
would consider a frivolous one.

to be such placid and content types, but you know that it probably stems
from the fact that Watch Hill is rebuilding itself, as much of Two Rivers
seems to be doing. Men walk hurriedly back and forth with building
supplies, wood, tools, thatch, whatever is necessary to rebuild much
needed houses. The goodwives seem to be ready spank or coddle
and child that should happen to be within her vicinity. And the children.
Oh, the children! They run around, shrieking and giggling, happy to
be finally free and safe. But the adults seem to know better, that this
victory is only the battle, but even the battle is important. It makes the
victory a lot easier to win.

      <roomdescription>Given the recent invasion of the Children of the Light, you are
suprised to see the progress that the town of Watch Hill as gone
through. A whole army of men had occupied the town but a few
months ago. But then again, Trollocs had also ravaged the towns
of Two Rivers, and many of them seem to have landed on their feet.
Some say that the people of Two Rivers have always been like this, 
their resolutions as strong as steel, as sturdy as those oak roots
that are stuck deep, deep beneath the roots, never to leave the earth
from where they came. Odd to think of these ordinary town people as
the stuff of legends, with their strong and stubborn blood keeping them
through all of this, isn't it?

through the green of the village. The travel is sparser than one sees in
Caemlyn obviously, and smaller cities like Baerlon and Whitebridge, but
it is heavier than traffic normally has been in the last few years or so.
The occasional merchant with a stray cart and farmers with their tabac
march by. You also wonder what the White Boar Inn looks like, the only
tiled roof in all of Watch Hill. This must be quite some building, or perhaps
this town is a bit more backwater than Emond's Field is.

You refrain from snorting, the adults might hear you. However, while

winding path that goes westwardly, as if it were going along to the
Mountains of the Mist. You are intrigued, but you remember the legends.
Truth, or just mist?

managed to rebuild themselves. Although, you have noticed this trend all
throughout Two Rivers. Villages, even farms and houses that had fallen into
the hands of Trollocs or Whitecloaks have been brought back with the aid of
the many villagers all eager to lend a hand to their fallen brethern. Despite
their ornery reputations, they do care and band together when they must.
Stubborn independence becomes united townfolk in the face of great danger.
This all sounds awfully familar, doesn't it?

You seem to feel that under your skin too. You shudder, despite the heat and hurry

of people cleaning and doing normal chores, so you envision the occasional
goodwife cleaning. The laughter of the children, ringing and singing always
in your ears, always the children that are there. Occasionally, there is a hint

sort of tea shop? With perhaps herbs too? You sniff the air
tentatively and note that there is an herbal hint to the air.
Why not step down south and take a look?

      <roomdescription>This is a shop that seems to carry a bit of this, and an end of
that, hence the name bits and ends. The woman who runs the
shop seems to take this name to the heart, for her dress is this
wonderous rainbow of rags, something quite similar to a gleeman's
cloak, yet a tad bit neater. The woman herself has a merry gleam
in her eye and welcomes all, even the little children who can't
seem to keep their hands off anything when they enter a room.
A good thing that nothing is fragile, everything seems sturdy
and quite prone to handling from children.

      <roomdescription>You take a street through the shops, allowing yourself to meander
and watch the people pass by as if you have nothing better to do.
That is not to belittle those who find their own comfortable nook and
stare at the people who go by, but given the bustle and tustle that goes
on, it would be counter to the normal behaviour of the Watch Hill 
villagers to merely sit there and watch the passerbys. Especially since
almost everyone in the small village has none each other forever and
has no need to stare at the faces they grew up with or tended too.
So enjoy the walk about, and the people you see.

trees are the same, right? You peer intently at the trees, noting that there
may be a bit more dark moss clinging to the bark, and piles of old, crunchy
leaves which seem to hide objects that may nip at your toes or pick at

flows down your back and hurry away from this bit of road.

To the east, the peaks of the Mountains of Mist can be seen still over
the trees, the clouds ringing the peaks in a most mysterious way, for
the mountains are tall, but not so tall as to warrant clouds around the
peak. The trees are closely spaced together, their leaves making
a thick canopy impenetrable to the light beaming down from above.
Far enough from either Emond's Field or Watch Hill, you can convince
yourself that you're in some deep and hidden forest, and can romp and
dream of other worlds. But there are no other worlds, but this one......
Or so you think.

Field, since that is the village that lies to the south on the map.  To the
west, you can see a group of high mountains whose peaks are ringed with clouds,
hence the name Mountains of the Mist.  The folks around here say that the
Mountains are bad luck, but is it truth?  Or just legend?

The house is simply old and weathered, the wood darkened by years of
sun, rain and wind battering the poor house, but the house is clearly
sturdy, with bits of \c03moss\c00 growing near the base, and clumps of
dry grass sparsely spotting the bit of earth before the house. No fence
encloses the house, but there is so much space between the road and
the house that a fence would be silly, especially since the owners had
wisely planted trees to provide some privacy.

And it has come back, bringing change. But how could there not

of the White Boar Inn. There are a few small rooms along with
a railing whose slats let you peer through to spy on the bottom
floor. Oh, you sneaky devil you. A quick glance around reveals the
wooden doors that lead to the small rooms on the floor. Feel free
to take a look around, or walk back down to the coomon room and
chat with Gia, perhaps?

      <roomdescription>A nice warm room, it's a tad small, but a snug fit for one,
with a small plush bed standing against the wall, with faded
paper sprinkled with flowers. A small window with light and 
frilly curtains lets the light stream into the tiny room, the 
motes floating to and fro the small walls. Two hooks
frame the window allowing for a place to hang your cloak
and your pack. A faint herbal scent clings to the sheets
and floats around the room. A most comfortable
lodgings indeed.

      <roomdescription>Although the room is on the small side and a little shabby, 
there is a feeling of coziness that puts you at ease more than
any other fancy inn room could do. The quilt covering the bed
is without a flap, all neat and tidy and cheery with its many
\c01p\c03a\c02t\c06c\c05h\c07e\c01s\c00 yet soft and almost fluffy. The two pillows are
plumped upright. There is a small nightstand to the left of the bed,
a green vase with a sprig of Emond's Glory standing upon it. 
Filmy white curtains hang from the room's one window, and
two hooks stand on either side of the windowsill for your
coat and other items. Yes, a fine room indeed.

out if necessary. You guess then that the room over there is
Lord Perrin's reception room. To the north is a staircase, to 
what seems private rooms. The line of people waiting to get
into the reception room seem absorbed in their own thoughts, 
whether it is a plan to get money from the Lord and his Lady or
thoughts of punishment for a misdeed.

gold but at the moment glints faintly in the light. Lovely tiles of purple
and red, mirroring the ones on top of the inn cover the roof. Light
from the sun reflects off expensive glass windows with black steel
frames, and really has the villagers blinded. Or could it be the glazed
look that the mere thought of having an audience with Lady Faile and
Lord Perrin that causes a villager to look like this?

recently been erected to house the Lady Faile and Lord Perrin 
Goldeneyes. despite much protest on Lord Perrin's behalf, but
rumor has it, behind closed doors of course, as befits a lord and
his lady, Faile explained to Perrin that a lord needs an abode that
is up to muster. So, because of the little talk, before you stands
a large house, still pale and unfinished, but easily the biggest 
house in all of Emond's Field, rivalling even the Winespring Inn.
Continue east down the path to enter the Manor and speak with
Lord Perrin and Lady Faile.

if you don't stare at them. Mistress Brenan's daughters are working 
throughout the garden, weeding, cutting, planting, arranging. A quick tug
at your elbow reveals the little girl again. Her dark eyes are glowing 
merrily, her scarlet bow askew with her curls blowing about wildly, she 
giggles. ' My name is Liselle,' she says. ' And Mama wants me to give you
a tour of the garden. Follow me.' And holding her hand, you follow her
through the posies.

other furniture but two chairs, One is a massive high backed chair
carved with falcons. The other chair of similar proportions, but carved
with wolves, a large wolf head at its peak. Two bare stone fireplaces
flank the ends of the room, ready for use in the bitter cold of winter that
should be here in Two Rivers, but seems to have lost its way.
Candlesticks line the room, but are unnecessary during the day, for
the huge windows let the sunlight come streaming in.

This is only a small fraction of his bees. In fact, he has them hidden

workers. Bees tend to find humans overwhelming and frightening creatures.
Ulie however, is calm, slow, and sure, and the bees know him. They seem
to swarm around him happily, as if greeting a friend. His youngest 
grandaughter can be seen chatting and giggling with Liselle. It seems that
Mistress Brennan and Ulie are old friends and they let the girls play
together often. The bees also benefit from this friendship, dipping into
Mistress Brennan's blossoms for the sweet nectar.

      <roomdescription>A plump grey squirrel sits on a branch in a tree here, turning
over a small green acorn in its tiny hands as though assessing
its worth. From the look of the squirrel, there is a plentitude
of food in this thin forest, though the trees here look fairly
bare and the bushes without berries. The squirrel looks a bit
on edge, as though expecting something or someone to appear here
shortly. Off in the distance you hear the sounds of an animal
moving through the brush, not bothering to attempt to muffle the
sounds it makes.

      <roomdescription>Some sort of crevice in the dirt is evident just to the north of
this thin, packed trail, from the indentation in the pine needles
that cover the ground uniformly throughout the forest. Perhaps
this is some small channel for the spring thaws that has been of
no use in recent times due to the weather, or perhaps the weather
has dried up a spring that used to run through here. Whichever it
is, there is no more water to be found here, though there must be
a source somewhere: the air is quite damp, and given the weather
of late, the dampness is not due to impending rain.

      <roomdescription>A sweet smell permates the air in this area, very faint yet
distinctly different from the smells of evergreen needles
and the moisture in the air. The smell seems to be coming
from just north of here, and indeed that is so: just on the
edge of the trail is a pile of crushed cloudberries, which
appear to be fresh. This is an unusual sight for this light
forest, considering that there do not seem to be any other
cloudberry bushes on the trail. The best explanation for
this is that someone else has been here recently. Just to
the west, the gaping mouth of a small cave faces you, giving
away nothing about its contents in its inky blackness.

At a few points here a small stream of water trickles down
the walls and collects in a series of small pools at the
sides of the cave, each pool connected to another via tiny
crevices in the rock where the water streams downhill to
some unknown destination.

incline in tiny crevices at the bottom of the rock wall,
all of them meeting in a fairly large pool of murky water
which is wide enough to cover nearly the entire floor of
the cave at this point. Although the cave is quite narrow
here, it is also quite high, high enough for the tallest
person to stand in, which is not the case in most of the
cave. Thankfully there is a strip of ground on one side of
the pool on which you can walk if you wish to continue. A
low sound can be heard deeper in the cave, though it is
unclear just what that sound is.

make what is probably an animal's den. From the sounds of
things, the animal is quite large; you hear a low growling
sound, most likely coming from more than one animal. By the
way the sounds increase and decrease simultaneously in their
intensity, the animals are interacting somehow. Here in the
cave, the smooth grey stone walls are quite cool and a bit
damp, though less so than they are just to the east, where
you can hear the sound of a light trickling of water.

      <roomdescription>\c07You reach the hollow, fallen tree and climb inside, because first of all
you're curious and second of all the surrounding foliage has gotten too 
thick to push your way through. This tree is huge, at least two armlengths 
in diameter and longer than any living tree here is tall. The long, dark, 
and damp pathway is surprisingly comforting: perhaps it's the faint sound of
moving water that echos soothingly from the round walls. Or perhaps it's the
incredible smell of rain and of slightly damp redwood. The tree has been
hollowed out not by man, but rather by time and moisture and lots of little
foraging animals. There are numerous places along your walk where you can 
sit down and admire the intricate patterns time has woven on the walls and 
ceiling of the tree. A cool breeze floats through from one end to the other.
You could definitely sleep more comfortably here than you have for a long,

is provided by huge blue spruce and sitka spruce, along with the occasional
ponderosa pine. You have to sweep several branches aside in order to even
walk on what you think is the path, frightening a blue jay or two along the
way. You can hear the muffled roar of rushing \c06water\c07 uphill to the northwest,
and to the southwest, you see a gigantic fallen tree. You think, &quot;what's a
redwood doing here?&quot; but then realize that this must not be a typical forest,

trail, which leads to the cliff and then seems to stop, is just far enough
away from the pool to avoid disrupting the fragile balance of nature you see

rug on the floor between them.  A small ajoining room has a bath tub big
enough for two.  On a tablebeside the tub are several large fluffy
towels and a bar of soap. A throw rug runs from beside the tub back
into the bedroom.

      <roomdescription>This is Perrin and Alvi's relaxation room.  In one corner there is a large
whirlpool.  Along the wall are bunches and bunches of stuffed mooses for 
their moosing contests.  Also there is a dart board and some beanbags.
One for Perrin and one for Alvi, anyone else has to bring their own.
This room is not for morts, well, except for Perrin and Alvi's alts:)
You may use it if you like, it is for relaxation and is completely ooc, 
most of the time that is.  Have fun and don't do anything not allowed.

      <roomdescription>You stand at the base of a large rocky protrusion. Looking for
a way to climb up, you quickly spot a clump of rock on the mountain
that seems to have been made to fit a human hand. How odd. A 
light covering of snow is everywhere, making things slippery.

      <roomdescription>The mountains loom more closely now, this whole area cast for most of the
day in shadow by their towering bulk.  Trees dating back hundreds of years
are dotted along the path, sometimes sparsely, in other areas more dense,
their foliage ranging in shades through autumn golds and reds to dark
verdant greens - for miles in every direction the forest stretches,
cloaking the mountainside pathway as it stretches higher and higher up the
rocky slopes.

foliage had once existed long scoured away by the driving wind, or the

to keep one huge stretch of ground clear, to form a path wide enough to
drive wagons through.  The road isn't perfectly straight or smooth, but
leads off towards the west and into the mountains, after passing through
some of the upper levels of the quarry.

      <roomdescription>As the quarry path continues to wind around the huge pit, it comes to this
small area - a sheltered spot shielded from the brute force of the wind by
many huge, tumbled rocks.  The stone is of the same stuff that seems to
have been mined here, yet hasn't been touched - quite possibly the result
of a rock fall after the pit was abandoned, or simply too awkward to reach
from the main route.  Towards the north, the path widens out and joins
what seems to be an actual road leading in a generally western direction,
towards the mountains.  The ground here consists only of gravel and small
hunks of stone, whatever foliage had once existed long scoured away by the
driving wind, or the endless days of sunshine of this summer.

until it simply disappears into the surrounding forest.  From here there's
a fairly good view of the nearby dig, a several hundred meter wide hole
gouged from the wilderness, of varying depths.  It its very base, often
cast in shadow, there seems to be a dark pool of stagnant water..  But
this path doesn't happen to come close enough to get a good look at it,
taking a meandering route around the upper levels of the quarry.

found further from the water.  Small pebbles dot the shore, along with some
sturdy grasses.  However, the banks are not large, and the forest overtakes the
land, shading the road as thickly as ever.  Dark stands of evergreen trees hang
heavy and dark, with few straggly needles clinging to the dark greay branches.
The other trees remain bare.  These past few years have been hard, the weather
doing odd things to the trees, stunting some of the younger ones, but every
year, they still grow.

thickest part of the forest.  The pines and firs, as well as the leatherleafs,
always have leaves, and the few spicewoods and laurels that sprinkle the path
are also covered with leaves, but the grand majority of the forest is bare,
nary a leaf on the many branches hanging overhead.  On the ground, little but
the sturdiest and of course ugliest of weeds seems to have sprouted.  Perhaps
with more clement and normal weather, the forest will be cast in a more
attractive light?

      <roomdescription>The air is almost deadly silent, and at first, it is difficult, especially for
merchants from the city to notice why, but even they are puzzled by the almost
heavy silence in the area.  But, as the people from the area will notice, the
forest lacks any sort of bird or squirrel rushing about.  The forest lacks the
noise that normally a forest ought to have.  There are no birds to flit through
the branches, chirping happily about their daily lives.  There are no squirrels
to scramble about brainlessly for a cache of nuts they had buried merely a
season ago or to chitter over the acorn that may happen to find its way into
the tiny paws of the squirrel.  The silence and emptiness is indeed odd.

through most of Two Rivers, a shock to many of those who live in the area.  
Merchants are not at all surprised by the monotony, since anything outside of
the city Caemlyn looks the same, with perhaps the exception of Baerlon and
Whitebridge, but even then, the simliarity seems odd to those from the lower
villages that think that above the Taren, the world is completely different.  
But a five minute stroll on this road would prove otherwise.

interlocked as if they try to hold hands, with just snatches of light flitting

Of course, this is why sticking to the road is a good idea.

River.  It is a large frame house flanked by a tall barn both with
high-peaked, thatched roofs, a curl of smoke rising from the stone
chimmeny on the far side of the house.  Near the barn is a pen where a few
sheep stand placidly munching their cud.  Well, the sheep in the pen are
most likely the weaker ones.  The sheep would normally be out in a lush
green pasture, tended by the farmer's children during the day.  Farms all
look the same anyway, no matter what part of the world you are in.  
Directly northwards the outer Palisades and the Southern Gates of Baerlon
are visible, the Gates themselves being closed throughout the hours of the
night while the Palisades extend outwards from the Gate to both the east
and west, effectively blocking traffic, except for through the Gates of
the City.

seems to be getting thinner, the trees set apart slightly more and the grasses
look more trod upon, as if various other travellers had entered the forest to

      <roomdescription>A copse of cedar trees stands off to one side, its fragrant needles mingling
both green and freshly fallen to brown and old in a prickly heap.  The faint
odor of woodsmoke hints at the presence of a human being at some point.  It
could have been a lone stranger, without a place to stay, not an impossiblity
considering the miles and miles of emptiness that goes on, people simply
avoiding all this land.  The land istelf is not terribly arable, sandy, rocky
soil, although it supports thistles and thornbushes quite nicely.

      <roomdescription>The road goes to the east, towards the famous town of Whitebridge.  From
looking at the road, it is hard to imagine that this flat road, with the
occasional grove of trees sprinkling the borders leads to a town with a milky
white bridge made of airy, lacey material that would take your breath away,
with docks and fishermen and merchants from all over Andor.  Yet, here the road
is, humble with its hard packed dirt, weeds and dry brush no different from
many other roads about the land.

      <roomdescription>The road now has the occasional stone deeply imbedded within its
well-packed dirt, enough to make a person wonder if once, long, long ago,
this road was something more than a path worn by years of the occasional
farmer and the cart of a merchant intent upon getting the best tabac Two
Rivers has to provide.  Or then again, the stones may be symbolic of the
people that live in that area.  As tough as stones, as if they had sprung
from the very earth.  Or then again, they could just be stones.

      <roomdescription>A cart rumbles by slowly, and the driver nods curtly, continuing to stare
with his eyes downcast, peering intently at the road, as if to avoid some
huge hole or bump that would jar his load of turnips onto the ground.  
The road dust would clearly ruin the already dusty turnips, especially
since the turnips have spent the grand majority of time underneath the
dirt and when bought, will be stored within a dark and most likely dirty
cellar.  But turnips are a necessary commodity, and in the cold of winter,
nothing like turnip soup with a sprinkling of cinnamon to warm the
insides.

      <roomdescription>A quiet pause on the trip at this bit of road allows a person to notice
the faintest trace of river breezes.  Whitebridge must be nearby if the
smells of the river can be smelled here.  The tang of water with the hint
of salty fish and the hint of tar, all the smells that would be associated
with a fishing town are here, a bit odd in Andor, but fishing isn't the
only thing that goes on in the town.  Walking further onto the the south
will reveal the sounds of merchants hawking their wares or haggling loudly
with each other.

some places, and yellow in others.  The trees are still sparse, as the
road inches its way closer and closer to Whitebridge, the trees are farer
and fewer in between.  Moss clings to the roots of the trees, pebbles
lying, waiting for a child to kick or gather in an attempt to play some
silly nonsensical game.  The road lies near Whitebridge at this point, or
winds on towards the north.

the direction of the town of Whitebridge.  The carts themselves are loaded
with goods and vegetables, which are not of the best quality and perhaps
slightly withered - but there seems to be an adequate selection and
supply.  Every now and then a cow is tied to the cart, slowly following
the cart, a bell clanging occasionally as the beast placidly chews her
cud, and swats her flank with her tail, killing the gnats that seek to
suck her blood.  The fragrant tabac and peaty whiskys add a hint of
mystery to the other smells floating in the air.

      <roomdescription>The crashing of the Arinelle against the banks is a soothing sound, but perhaps
more awe-inspiring then the lacy white foam created by the strong currents is
the lacy white piers of the bridge.  Spanning high above the town, the town
almost seems insignificant.  The milky white creation seems as if made of one
piece, a large stone sculpture created by some great giant.  Well, the Oigers
to be exact.  It shines and gleams in the sun like glass, but there is no man
strong enough to break it, nor will rain ever make it slippery.  A breathtaking
sight, all else pales in comparision, even for the folk still a bit wet behind
their ears.

clearly as big as Baerlon, as a quick jaunt through the streets demonstrated.  
Hawkers on the street cry out for their wares, which lie in small heaps in
front of them, the fishermen seeming to have few wares also.  The odd growing
seasons have yielded little of anything for either farmers or fishermen.  
There are many shops and inns along the various streets, and a day or two will
be enough to see all the stores and inns, or perhaps not.

This beautiful bridge still has you all agoggle, but you try to repress
these silly backwater feelings, so the merchants who pass here everyday
will not mock you and snicker at you behind your back. Of course, since
you are paranoid and completely untrusting of rumors, you bring out a
cup of water and oh so innocently spill it on the floor. You slide your
foot across and gasp. Not even the teensiest slippery! You nod to yourself,
as if mentally checking off one item. Then you surreptitiously bring out a
chisel and innocently bang at one of the spires with such delicate lacy
patterns that it would break your heart if you chipped them. You gasp!
Not even one chip! What a piece of art. You whistle apperciatively as
you cross the bridge.

nary a mark. Rumor has it that this is a remnant from the Age of Legends.
Whatever it may be, it is beautiful enough to take your breath away.

      <roomdescription>The Caemlyn Road is broad and shows sign of much use - hoove prints, wagon
ruts, and dusty footprints stretching off to the west towards Whitebridge,
or the east towards Four Kings.  A common sight now is the steady line of
weary travellers who wander travel the road, an exodus which seems only to
pause at night, when the refugees camp in the fields nearby.  The &amp;yg&amp;gr&amp;ya&amp;gs&amp;ys&amp;n
along the road is dry and yellow, farmsteads seem run down and badly kept,
and the flowers which would usually surruond this road are few and far
apart.  All who travel the road end up coated in a layer of dusty
road-scum, making the journey none too pleasant.

      <roomdescription>Out further away from Four Kings, the road is quieter. Less merchant
traffic allows for the perhaps more quiet traveller to note the little animals
that populate the vegetation along the road. If you look very closely, you'll
note the mother rabbit and her baby bunnies nibbling on the sparse clover
patch. The dry near brown grass helps to disguise the rabbits even more.
Perhaps you'll run across more of these shy animals along the way.

could have possibly done it, but that would require thousands of years,
lots of wind, rain, perhaps even a river to have accomplished such? 
You shrug your shoulders. Nature is something that no one can ever

      <roomdescription>You have entered a village known as Emond's Field. It is small, with dirt
packed paths passing as roads. It is secluded, seemingly untouched by either
its Queen or time, the old blood running deep. But times have brought change
to Emond's Field as it has with the rest of the world. Trollocs and
Whitecloaks have ravaged the land, destroying houses and families alike.
Refugees from other countries flee through the Mountains of Mist to 
escape the turmoil of their homelands. But, the people of Emond's Field
endure. However, new influences can be seen now. Tairen and Domani dresses 
have replaced some of the stout Two Rivers woolens. Beards, roofing, and 
other small details are different. Even Emond's Field cannot escape the 
turning of the Wheel.

her screaming to her mother, while her brother ducks for cover. Carts

The pole from the last Bel Tine seems to still be standing, the gaily

to say that they don't have their own problems to fix. But it will all work
out in the end, for everyone will help. Takes more than a few Trollocs to
destroy Emond's Fielders.

      <roomdescription>The trail bends off here, allowing you to see most of the village,
the rushing Winespring churning its way to Master Thane's mill
and beyond to the Waterwood, splintering off into tiny little springs.
The houses on the side of the road are clean and cheery, with an
occasional bunch of flowers at the windowsill, or some even growing
in the yard before the house. The sound of distant banging hammers
can be heard, and carts and people mill about too.

a huge tome. The shop is shaded by a huge elm, adding to its air of secrecy

kerchiefs, but nothing helps. Only a thorough shaking will remove
it, and no one will dare to remove their dress or pants to get rid of dust. 
So the villagers grin and bear the dirt. They sigh, and wonder if the
weather will ever be right again. Even the Wisdoms complain about how 
they can no longer listen to the wind.

enough thick beards. You scratch your head. Aren't these Emond's 
Fielders supposed to be impervious to changes of the world? There's
even a Domani dress shop to the east! Of all the things! You gasp.
Perhaps the rumors of refugees coming from the west are true.
But oh my, what ever is the world coming to now?

woolen dresses that are servicable and comfortable, but not particularly
revealing or fashionable. Perhaps it is because the older women themselves
want to wear pretty dresses. After all, is there a single woman in the world
that does not like pretty dresses? Well, if they say so, they are lying.
Or perhaps the older women are simply letting the younger women try new
things, understanding how young people must find themselves, even if it is
something as silly as changing one's dress.

      <roomdescription>You take in a deep breath and think for a moment. Isn't it odd after all
how Two Rivers folk seem to have gotten their reputation? They are a tad
wary of strangers, this is true, but aren't all people, when you get down
to it? Why call someone introverted for acting like that? And stubborn?
Everyone likes getting their own way, so what would make these people
especially so known for that? And they do welcome strangers. There are
Tairens, Domani, Cairhiens, people from all sorts of countries and classes
assimlating themselves into the village nicely. Well, rumors never like
it when their subject matter is normal. Which these people are? At least
you think so...

rhythm of a lullaby that soothes your senses, making you drowsy. The heat
does little to keep your eyelids propped open, and your head droops over,
drool slowly falls down your chin and you snore lightly. A villager taps
you on the shoulder and you shake your head, brushing away the cobwebs

Almost as if someone had drugged you. You scratch your head and turn

Poppy seeds? Could this possibly be normal? Or right for that matter? 
You shrug and hurry off, a bit alarmed at these odd thoughts in your

doors. The lawns in front of the houses are bright \c02green\c00, with patches

Manatheren. It had been ravaged compeletely, its people staying to the
bitter end to defend it from the Dreadlords and Trollocs and such.
A thorn in the Dark One's hand, these people had been famous for their
persistance, their stubbornness, and their pride. And this pride, this
stubbornness, can be found in their descendants, the people of Two 
Rivers. Hard to believe that the humble villagers of Emond's Field, 
Deven's Ride, and Watch Hill could have such grand blood in them, but it 
is true. Amazing how the Wheel will turn, isn't it?

Now, there is nothing unusual with finding a group of toddlers. When you
enter a village where there are a number of families living within it, 
there are bound to be little children. However, these children seem to be
playing patty-cake and castle building in the middle of the path. Huge ruts
spot the road, the large gaping holes randomly sprinkled throughout the
path's length. They seem to be having a merry old time, giggling and
screeching, seeing who can make the highest mountain. Ahh, but it seems that
Goodwife Nilly has found them. They then pull their most innocent faces,
knowing that their feigned innocence may lessen their punishment. Slightly.

disagreement on how to fill the holes. You personally don't seem to 
understand how there could be a disagreement on all of this, yes? You 
take a shovel, fill it with dirt and then proceed to deposit the earth into 
the hole. Of course, there is the whole issue of how the dirt is to find its
way to the holes, what sorts of shovels to use, which holes to fill first, 
and....  You pause for a moment. Perhaps hole-filling is more complicated
than you thought.

until you step on the man-made illusion, you think it's real. Of course,
if you then proceed to say break your ankle upon it, then you would know

      <roomdescription>Here the beginnings of the Winespring can be found. For it is here that 
its source bubbles sweet and clear, its churning yet oddly soothing sounds 
flow over your mind. No matter how dry it is, no matter how prevalent the 
drout may be, it never seems to affect the Winespring. True, it may be a
bit slower, or a bit softer, but can anyone deny the beauty of this body of 
water. It gurgles merrily towards the Green, rumbling off past the mill, 
until the Waterwood, flowing off into innumerable springs and tricklings 
that seem to become nothing.

      <roomdescription>You gasp as you see before you an amazing building. One you wouldn't expect
to find in a village such as Emond's Field. A two story building, it is made
of stone dragged from the river, the faded grey, blue and purple stones
piled neatly atop each other and mortared carefully and tightly together,
there is no other building like it. The others are whitewashed or even
made of mud or sod, but not river stone. The roof is covered with red tile.
The rest of the houses in Emond's Field have thatch. There are also a 
dozen tall chimneys peeping from here and there. Supposedly, even the floors
of the first floor of this building are made of river stone. Clearly,
this inn has been around for a long while. There is even an old foundation
here bigger than the present inn. You wonder perhaps, what the inn may have
been like. But welcome to the Winespring Inn. Step right in.

walk past you. People walk by with small packages and letters tucked in the
crock of their elbows. It seems they are sending packages of some sort off.
Perhaps you'll follow them and see where it is they are going to?

paths in this village are smooth dirt paths, but it seems that the Quarry
Road at some point had been covered with stones, like streets in the city
Now, nothing but a few sprinkling of stones remain. A random stone here, a
rock there, the dirt remains prevelant. However, all it seems the rocks are
good for now is attracting weeds. You notice that around each stone is a 
lovely circle of weeds. But the weeds are rather nice. Some of them even 
have lacy white flowers sprouting from them.

can picture Master Thane's mill which lies but a short walk from here.
And you can picture the mysterious Waterwood, where the springs part and
cross, growing smaller and smaller, til they are mere trickles that barely
dampen the pebbles and roots of trees they come across. There seems to be
bad luck associated with this part of Two Rivers, though not as strongly 
as with the Mountains of the Mist and the Sand Hills. In fact, it would seem
that the Emond's Fielders just have an implicit fear attached to anything
forgein.

      <roomdescription>The Winespring churns its way west from the Green towards the Waterwoods,
splintering into many little springs. Master Thane's Mill lies twixt the 
two, taking advantage of the white foamy water to grind grain for the 
villagers of Emond's Field. The squat building is made of blue, grey and 
purple stones taken from the Winespring itself. A large wheel made of oak 
spins the water over and over again, splashing water all about, making a 
glittering cascade fall down into the water over and over again. A path 
made of bits of slate goes east to the entryway of the mill.

Master Thane directs one of his appretices to check on the consistency of 
the grain in one wheel while he tells another to place some more grain on 
another wheel. The dull roar of the spring and what seems to be the smell 
of freshly baked cookies offer a soothing ambience to the room.

Some of the barrels may have fruits, leaves or even flower petals floating 
inside of them. But it is very important what the liquid is housed with. 
So important, there are traditions that various families hand down, 
generation to generation, so that there will be knowledge for all to share,
if not to know. In the back, Master Dwin carefully pours cider from the

is to see Tairen wares in the middle of Two Rivers, yet here they are.
The young woman appears well off, if not a tad tired and wary. She seems 
eager to help any of the young woman that manage to wander in, knowing 
that the Two Rivers girls are eager to shed their woolens for something
a tad more daring. But she is carefuly to not make the dresses too daring,
for fear of what the Women's Circle would say to her.

      <roomdescription>A willowy woman with coppery skin and smouldering dark eyes smiles as you 
enter her shop. Her dress is styled in a manner famous or perhaps infamous
throughout the land. Throughout the shop are various samples of her work,
fine filmy dresses and shifts. You sniff carefully and notice a faint musky
scent that makes your head spin. Even the light seems a tad dimmer here.
You just hope her wares aren't too expensive, since you know that you just
have to buy something.

mysterious things the Eldin's seem to have hidden in their attic for 
generations. Their daughter Gayle seems to be tending shop today. She 
stands behind a counter, reading one of the many books of old legends 
that always mystified her as a child. Even the objects she sells fascinate 
her, hinting at some huger, grander time. She hears you suddenly jostle 
an old relic and jumps up with a gasp and smiles, ready with some story 
attached with the item you peer at intently or graze with your fingers.

sits on a bench, whistling some low song that sounds tuneless as he 
carves his next creation. Fragrant wood shavings litter the floor around
him, but in a comforting messiness. He nods as he sees you look about. 
His carved animals are almost life-like, his other wooden objects 
delicate and finely polished to glow in the light. Clearly good at his 
trade, even if he just started out as an amateur making toys for his
nephews and nieces.

cider line the walls. The wine is from other places throughout the land, 
but the only brandy and cider seen is Two Rivers, for who makes better
brandy and cider? And ale too. In fact, there is little in here that 
isn't of Two Rivers. The stairs lead back up to the kitchen of the inn.

fireplace of river stones stretching half the room's length, the lintel 
as high as a man's shoulder. A polished tabac container and the villages's 
only clock, a rather large grandfather clock of many years lie on top of 
the mantel. Tall backed chairs stand before the fireplace in a half circle 
for the Village Council to meet and discuss matters comfortably. The 
bookshelves opposite the fireplace hold a dozen worn slim volumes. Casks 
of ale and wine stand on the other side of the room. The various tables in 
the inn are empty for now, the tabac season not quite here yet, so all the 
tables are bare except for one where the inn's silver and pewter lie, 
waiting to be polished. And on a sad note, you notice the various spears, 
polearms and swords lined up against the barrels. Yes, Emond's Field is 
feelign the changes of time too.

iron stoves and all but one fireplace banked of their fires. However, the
smell of freshly-baked bread and sweet honeycakes still lingers in the

one wall filled with plates, bowls and such. A rack holding neatly 
labelled glass jars of spices sits on the other wall. Mistress al'Vere, or
just Marin stands there with her graying long braid and her beaming
matronly face. She is brewing a spot of tea over the only burning fire in
her large striped pot, ever ready for the stray visitor.

Perhaps this is just a small iundulgence the woman give their men.
They do need to be indulged every now and then.

stables. There is little need to outline the path with anything, since the 
stables are quite close to the inn itself, and it would take an absolute
woolhead to not be able to find them, but you can never be to sure. And 
Marin thinks the bricks make for a rather attractive decoration. Dirt 
paths do get tiresome after a while.

Every now and then, a pony or two can be found there, and Bran keeps his
pair of Dhurrans in a stall. But in most cases, the stalls are empty, quiet
and smell of clover, not horse.

Bags of oats and horse feed sit in a dark corner, and some extra tack sits
next to them. The loft is a cosy place for a quick nap or a conversation
for people who have a need of privacy. Just beware for those other

cleaning it, oiling it, and the other sundry tasks that a stableboy must 
do. Under his breath, the boy is whistling a soft comforting tune that is

A piece of clover hangs from the corner of his mouth, bobbing up and down 
as he chews slowly on it, peering intently on the bridle that he is mending.

      <roomdescription>A pair of large and sturdy Dhurrans stand in this stall. They seem to be 
placid, gentle creatures. Not known for their speed, they are good for 
pulling plows and such. Farmers' horses in essence, then, and since
Emond's Field is a village of tabac farmers, Dhurrans seem a likely 
occurance. At the moment, their noses are buried deep in their feed bags,
whickering softly and chewing happily. Their heads peek out of the 
stalls, just over the half door which keeps them from running amok,
although looking at these two, you doubt they could even run.

neatly against the wall, allowing for easy access to the horse's owner 
and the stableboys. The feed bag also hangs limply from the wall, the 
trough empty. The stall simply waits for some horse to fill up its barren 
space, but seeing as how there is little chance of merchants or peddlers
stopping by Emond's Field, it will be empty a bit longer.

they may not be quite the cream of Caemlyn inns, but no inn in Caemlyn

Perhaps it is the tabby cat that always manages to sneak in no

this room, since there is no avoiding the cat. The quilt is made of
down, and the mattress even feels like it is down-filled also.
There also seems to be a hint of roses and baking bread smells
in this room, which seem to further your sense of comfort.
