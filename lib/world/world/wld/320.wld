      <roomdescription>The walls of the room have been painted a dark uniform black in color.  
Heavy drapes cover the windows blocking out all source of natural light.
Two heavy lamps made of decorative wrought iron stand in each corner,
casting an artifical light across the room.  Several small bean bag chairs
litter the floor for those who feel social enough to sit and talk to each
other.  The dark grey carpet is barely visible underneath.
