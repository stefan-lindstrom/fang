      <roomdescription>The most impressive thing about this room is the large bed with posts that
drip curtains made of lace.  It looks to be recently placed here, the lace
not looking as worn as the scuffed and old wooden floor.  An armchair sits
in front of a window, recently upholstered in fabric that was old to begin
with from all appearances.  The window is closed and has lace for curtains
that match the canopy on the bed.  There are no personal belongings here,
just worn out furniture.

      <roomdescription>This room gives the feeling of someplace far from Salidar.  It is
decorated in the blues favored by the noble families of Mayene, from the
silk curtains to the satin drapped bed directly across from the door.  
Just to the right of the bed is a large red-hued wooden wardrobe with
small tapestries depicting the harbor of Mayene to either side of it.  
Against the other wall below the only window in the room is a large desk,
neatly kept, and free of clutter.  In front of the desk is a chair made of
the same wood with a cushioned seat of the same blue as the rest of the
room.  Carved into the back of the chair is the idolized hawk of Mayene.
The floor is covered with a large rug, spanning nearly the whole of the
room.  Overall it is a small space that does not fit in with the rest of
this small village.

lit and the walls even make it more dreary and dark than perhaps it might
be in another time and place.  In the light of day, one might be able to
tell that the panels in the wall have been waxed to a dull shine recently.

chair and a wooden wardrobe that has been waxed into a dull
shine. There is also one window that overlooks the stables of

waxed to a dull shine, cracks not standing out as they once would have.

headquarters for messages.  There is a board hung on the east wall that
has had notes tacked to it and a table opposite that has old writing
supplies.  It appears nothing more than an abandoned cottage but has not
had the benefit of waxing and cleaning that a few other buildings in the
village have had.  A door leads to the south and judging by the window, it
looks to be a porch of some kind.

both shoved against the walls to make room for a set of sofas, a group of
chairs, and numerous trunks and small tables.  There are more smaller
chairs resting on the beds but all look to be broken or in bad repair.  
The window across from the door stands open, letting in snow and frigid
air.  The wood paneling below the window looks to be rotting with the
frozen water of the incoming weather conditions.

a couple of squirrels play in the treetops.  The gardens are
a quiet place in the middle of bustling Salidar where you can

      <roomdescription>This hallway is much like all the others in this old vacant inn.  The
walls appear to be decorated in dark panelling which makes the darkness
worse since there are no windows here.  A few tapestries and paintings
hang from the walls, each looking as if they are much too old to grace a
decent wall.  The floor has recently had its wooden planks shined and the
latches recently waxed.  No matter the work that was done, the cracks in
the wood are still visible even in dark lighting.

      <roomdescription>This is a large and spacious room.  The curtains covering the windows are
heavy and blue, hung to keep out the light.  A bookshelf rests against one
wall but is bare of books and any of other objects.  The dust is thickd
but there are fingerprints through it showing that someone has been here
recently and taken a look around.  Several doors lead off from this room
to other rooms of the large house, each one likely as large as this.

there is a box on it that looks full of personal belongings packed as if
they were left behind.  The shelves on the opposite wall hold small jars
and look to hold different herbs and roots, suggesting that someone set it
up to study or display them.  On the table next to a large chair sits a
few twigs from a fruit tree.

the novices in their white dresses, dusted over with a thin layer
of dirt from literally running from house to house all day, performing
chores and errands. South Salidar Road runs east to west here, the 
single working inn in it a guest house of sorts, but more often, the 
place where the messengers who come and go to all parts of the world
rest briefly before carrying out the interminable supply of orders
by the Aes Sedai. The docks by the river Eldar are to the west.

all sides of the bed.  Sitting next to the bed, is a square, wooden table
with the same gauzy material hanging down from the top all the way to the

acting as markers.  On the floor, at the foot of the bed, is a small chest

darkly stained doors resting firmly shut.  To the right of the door is a

      <roomdescription>Tarvaleth's room is quite large and airy.  The large window in the north
wall lets in the bright sunshine at all hours of the day.  The soft ivory
curtains that frame the window flutter lightly when a breeze passes through
the room.  There is a large, comfortable looking bed in the southwest 
corner of the room, while a large mahogany wardrobe stands in the northwest 
corner.    A small night table sits next to the bed and there is often
at least one book lying on it, if not more.   The only other furnishings
in the room are two large, comfortable looking armchairs and a small 
vanity table, on which sits a bowl and pitcher of water, and a small 
looking glass.

pouring in and out of its door--messengers, novices, and servants

here, running north through the town of Salidar.

even just a mug of ale or sip of wine before they all go off again, 
everyone here on business for the Aes Sedai or the rather large army
the Servants of All are putting together quietly in the backforest of
Altara. Some here are even soldiers and servants, on their meal breaks, 
coming to find conversation and news of the outside world. The cook 
emerges from the kitchen, wiping her large wooden spoon on the front 
of her apron, and surveys the crowd, counting and nodding to herself 
before turning and going back into the kitchen, taking one of the 
younger barmaids by the ear and dragging her along for staring 
wide-eyed at a fresh-faced young soldier.

smoothly, a small woman with a surprisingly loud voice, but she smiles as
you enter, and seems very friendly and accomodating.

reaching out over the smooth, packed red earth of the street.
A few large houses stand along the edges of the street,

the room seem very comfortable. The decorations are in \c04b\c06l\c14u\c06e\c04s\c00, of
course, with lots of deeply cushioned chairs and sofas. A round
table of a pale wood stands in the middle of the floor, polished

Novices and Accepted hurrying by, and children darting in and out of
the forest trees.  To the west is the Little Tower of Salidar and to the
east is the forest.  Far to the north are the pastures where the horses
of the Little Tower are kept.

are also travelling the road. Through the forest you can see the 
animals scampering...squirrels, deer and even an occasional wolf.

      <roomdescription>Heavy &amp;ro&amp;ya&amp;rk&amp;ye&amp;rn&amp;n double doors open to a spacious interior, an office toned with
the natural colors of the surrounding forest, set with a desk and
comfortable looking chair all in dark stained and well-loved &amp;Kwoods&amp;n.  The
desk is large and boasts several small shelves, making efficient use of
the space without seeming cluttery as everything on it's surface appears
to be in place.  There are two smaller chairs set before the desk,
probably for whomever has been called here, leaving the rest of the room
fairly limitted in furniture.  There are a few small tables about, and a
large armoire in one corner, but that is the extent of it.  Instead of
lavish decorations or expensive carpets, the personal effects are simple
in nature.  A rug of soft rabbit pelts lies on &amp;ge&amp;ya&amp;Kr&amp;gt&amp;yh&amp;Ke&amp;gn&amp;n tiles beneath the
Mistress' side of the desk and the walls that are not interrupted by a
window are nearly covered in beautiful &amp;Kblack&amp;n and &amp;Wwhite&amp;n sketchings.  Most
of them are framed and, of a whole, seem to be of Salidar or the goings on
of it's residents.  They are arranged in tasteful patterns on the walls,
but there are many of them, and one wonders how long one could stand here
gazing at all of their details.  There is a door to the north that is
flanked with large and laden bookshelves, giving this room a truely
well-educated, classy aura of practical beauty.

There is a large &amp;Kb&amp;ye&amp;Ka&amp;yr&amp;K f&amp;yu&amp;Kr&amp;n stretched out on the floor, a kill that appears
to be fresh and well-cared for.  A desk of dark toned wood rests off to
one side, near some large windows, and the windows themselves have a nice
&amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;n linen draping that usually blows in the wind when the windows can be
kept open.  Across the room, a large draped bed sits, and behind that are
rows of bookshelves that nearly cover the far wall.  A small table sits
under a row of windows to the right, and above it a &amp;Ws&amp;wwor&amp;Wd&amp;n hangs on the
wall, point down.  It points to the table, upon which rests a small book
and a set of daggers, and the table is covered in a thick kind of &amp;Kblack&amp;n
fabric.  This is one of the only ornamental aspects of the room, however
detailed and ritualistic, except for the fireplace along the left wall and
the dresser beside it.  &amp;wCa&amp;Wn&amp;Kd&amp;Wl&amp;wes line the top of the armoire and stand held
in iron ornamentation alongside, and flanking the free-standing
candelabras are the panes of two slender, floor length mirrors.  If one
should happen to turn and take notice, the wall that is broken by the door
is also hung with a large and finely spun tapestry depicting a swooping
&amp;Kblack&amp;n hawk, it's talons outstretched.

world of &amp;Kinks&amp;n and endless &amp;Wp&amp;wa&amp;Wg&amp;we&amp;Ws&amp;n, as the entirety of the walls is covered
in drawings of all shapes and sizes.  Many are landscapes, some familiar
to Salidar and others foreign, and many more are visages of people long
past or current neighbors.  The rest of the decor is relatively
simplistic, though beautiful, and bearing of a certain dignity.  
Dark-colored woods make up a dresser and bedframe to match, and the pair
are both carved in tiny, intricate patterns of &amp;gv&amp;Gi&amp;Kn&amp;ge&amp;Gw&amp;go&amp;Kr&amp;gk&amp;n and inlaid with
shells shaped into delicate &amp;mf&amp;Bl&amp;co&amp;gw&amp;ce&amp;Br&amp;ms&amp;n.  There are two chairs and a small
couch as well, before the fire, and adequate lighting from soft lamps in 3
places around the room.  A soft carpet covers the floor, in a pale &amp;Kgrey&amp;n
tone, and the windows of the room are draped in linens of a similar color.
In all, this is a fascinating dwelling, scattered with books and candles
and wrapped in the feeling of a retreat from the outside world.

Accepted in dresses of white and bands of seven colors around their hems. 
The citizens of Salidar move through the street, no less busy than the 
ageless women all around them, but always giving them plenty of space to

To the west is the entrance to the Little Tower, and to the east is the

the clang of hammers from the forge just outside the village speak of
horses being shod and armor being mended.  At the end of the alley way
