      <roomdescription>This is the southwestern corner of the fairly small city of
Alindaer. At least, the city is small compared to the grand
city of Tar Valon which is east of here. Here two streets
begin which trace the southern and western edges of the city,
Pebble Road stretching off to the east and Silvare Road off
to the north. There is a small gate here to the southwest,
leading to the road on which the hundreds of travellers who
journey each day between Caemlyn and Tar Valon walk or ride.

      <roomdescription>Here at the intersection of two fairly wide streets in the
northern section of town, a small unpaved road splits from the
corner and moves off to the north and west, curving around large
trees and rocks to provide a sinuous path to a farm of some kind
a fair distance away from the city. Far off to the west, a thick
forest rises from gentle sloping hills, and continues southward
toward Caemlyn. Both the road to Caemlyn and the thorougfare to
Tar Valon are south of here, the way to Tar Valon being by way
of River Street, which eventually passes under the gates of this
city and makes its way over the bridge on the River Erinin.

      <roomdescription>A man walks calmly down the side of the street here among the
other travellers, distinguishing himself from the rest of those
walking by the large pole he carries, out of the top of which
extend several smaller rods. On those rods hang several lanterns
of different sizes and shapes, ranging in material from cheap
wood and glass to brass and silver. He walks slowly and with a
determined purpose, softly delivering his pitch as though all
around him will stop to listen. Occasionally someone will walk
up to him and purchase a lantern of one kind or another, though
for the most part the man walks a solitary walk, enclosed in his
own world by the curtain of hanging lanterns all around him.

      <roomdescription>The hot breeze picks up, blowing a dry cover of dust across the
road. A group of women walk down this street, quite wide at this
point, and fairly busy with the traffic of travellers journeying
through Alindaer between Caemlyn and Tar Valon. The women stroll
down the side of the street as though they do not notice the crowd
around them or the bustle of the merchants propositioning them to
buy goods of all sort. The paving on this road looks well-maintained,
and the buildings look to be in good shape. This street is just a bit
more elevated than the rest of the streets and alleys in the city,
affording a better view of the White Tower of Tar Valon here than
most places. Even though most of the grand city is not visible from
here, the White Tower still stands tall.

      <roomdescription>A frighteningly large spider skitters across the road here, very
quickly finding the shadows and disappearing beneath a rock. What
looks like some sort of temporary shop has been erected here. It is
formed by a large tent which extends a bit into the road but does not
block the way for most of the carts. Beneath the flimsy cover which
the tent provides is a clutter of assorted merchandise, some of which
looks promising, and the rest of which looks to be of little value.
Despite the lack of quality, though, a number of people are sifting
through the merchandise, most of them seeming only to want something
to do with their time. Very few are buying, but the proprietor seems
confident despite the skeptical looks of his customers.

      <roomdescription>This small, paved road is flecked with polished black stones which
swim among those of the more ordinary white. This seems to be some
sort of trademark of the city of Alindaer, shared between all the
streets but the smallest alleys. Most of the time during the late
afternoon the colors seem to blend, the dust of hundreds of feet
equalizing the opposites, lightening the black and dirtying the
white. This is the northernmost road in the city of Alindaer, the
city which sits across the River Erinin from Tar Valon. Some distance
to the east, the beauty of the White Tower of Tar Valon is visible,
rising far above the rest of the buildings between here and there,
even from this great distance dominating the scene. Just to the west
and south from here is the road that traverses the distance between
this city and the grand city of Caemlyn.

      <roomdescription>A small lane starts here to the south, curving around buildings and
trees and rocks towards the main road through Alindaer. On either
side of the southern part of this intersection, in front of a tabac
shop and a tavern, two large barrels have traded in their water-
carrying days for a more domesticated purpose: growing flowers.
Apparently someone has filled these barrels with soil and planted
wildflowers in them in a random pattern, and makes sure they are
well-watered. The result is a cacophany of colors, though as a whole
they are somewhat faded and wilted by the constant dry heat, most
likely a condition that could only be avoided by constant watering.

      <roomdescription>A young girl skips happily down the street, quite dirty and fairly
disheveled, and seeming the only one oblivious to her condition.
Perhaps she has been amusing herself in the park whose main path
begins to the north of here, a path leading to a small pond and a
few benches. The pond is naturally fed by a small creek which flows
in from the north, and apparently more than water travels down this
creek; the young girl is carrying some kind of small, wet lizard or
frog in both her hands, concentrating on holding it so that it will
not slip from her hands and land on the dry stone paving. She smiles
with the surety that her family will take this new family member in;
it seems to amuse the passersby somewhat, at least those who stop or
slow to take notice.

      <roomdescription>To the south, on the side of this small street that runs east and west,
stands a shop of some kind. Both by the sign above its open door and
the scents wafting from that door, it is a pastry shop. It may be the
only one in town, judging by the amount of business it seems to get at
all hours of the day. There is a great number of people on this road
considering its size; one would expect the wider River Street to the
south to be a bit busier, considering that it is the thoroughfare of
this city, connecting the road from Caemlyn to the bridge across the
River Erinin that leads to Tar Valon. Then again, perhaps it is more
crowded, and this is just a busy city. A young woman walks down the
road here, her hair braided in one long braid that runs down her back,
enjoying a trat of some kind, looking like a pear or apple tart.

familiar hot breeze across everything in sight. A scrawny-looking dog
trundles along the side of the road here, keeping close to the exterior
walls of the buildings bordering this east-west street. The dog appears
to be trotting lazily on his way, though he jumps at the slightest
sounds and gazes hungrily at any and all passersby. Occasionally a
child tosses him a crumb or a scrap, or an adult nonchalantly drops a
morsel which the dog immediately snatches and takes with him down an
alley or between two buildings. Not all of the passersby on the street
are sympathetic to the dog&apos;s position, however; those peddlers on the
road growl at the dog as it passes, as though they might understand it
somehow. A bit further to the east, a small lane branches from Tower
Street, leading south towards the main road through Alindaer.

Some children are playing in front of a smallish building with a lawn

narrow, and looks as though it could be a shop with a small living
space above it. The children are dressed in hardly any clothes, though
that is not surprising considering the heat. The children do not seem
to notice the temperature; perhaps past a certain point, the amount of
sweat running down the children&apos;s backs does not matter to them. Most
of the people passing by on this street do so as though they fail to
notice the running figures or the shouts, though a few travellers stop
and take notice.

young boys meet from each direction, looking surprised to see each

quaint, somewhat shaded by the buildings alongside it, causing long
rectangles of sunlight to slant across the white paving stones flecked
with black. To the north, a small building proclaims itself to be a
bath house, the sign above it a painted porcelain tub full of bright
blue water. The building next to it appears to be a tea shop, and
perhaps even a bit more, considering the sign above with a painted
bookshelf on it. The lane here stretches out to the south, curving
just slightly toward the main road through Alindaer, which serves as
a thoroughfare between the road to Caemlyn and the city of Tar Valon
across the Erinin.

apparently a bazaar or market of some sort. The variety of shops
and food stands in that small fair create a random array of sounds,
wafting across the street like a distinct signature smell. Not that
there aren&apos;t any of those around: the smell of baking flatbread and
simmering roast combine with the tart aroma of red wine and punch
to give the impression that an inn common room is somewhere nearby.
A bit to the west of here, a small lane branches off from Tower Street
toward River Street to the south. This street is so named because of
its elevation, just slightly higher than the rest of the city to the
south, which gives it an unobstructed view of the White Tower of Tar
Valon, which rises from the square in the middle of the city to the
east.

envious stares of a few passersby, but she also earns a few annoyed
glances, such as that of the woman walking just behind her, carrying
a small basket of eggs down this street and then down the small lane
just a bit to the west. This part of the road is on the eastern side

walk purposefully down the street here, speaking calmly amongst
themselves. They seem to be the only ones along the street who fail
to notice the swarm of small white puffs floating through the street
on the hot breeze. They must have been expelled from some plant
seeking to distribute its seeds. Their numbers and colors could almost
fool one into thinking that they are the frigid flakes of a snowstorm,
despite the hot, dry weather and all the other evidence to the contrary.
The spores mostly settle among the pebbles on this road to be stomped
by the ignorant feet of passersby. Tower Street here meets a southbound
avenue which parallels the River Erinin, and because of it, is a bit
cooler than the other streets in Alindaer.

this stable doubles either as their stable entirely or as a set

the ground without a pair of feet to go with them.

side of Tar Valon, much of the merchandise available in Alindaer
is less expensive than that which could be purchased in the grand
city herself. You can easily distinguish between the travellers
and the people native to this small city: the townspeople look
energetic and ready to take on their day whatever it might bring,
while most of the people travelling look as though an unexpected
wind could push them over, at which point they would be unable
to stand back up. At the same time they look expectant somehow,

      <roomdescription>Just north of here, this small lane meets a much wider street that
borders the northern edge of the city. Although it is a pretty lane,
it is a bit rough and dirty around the edges, as though the cleaning
has not been as thorough lately. It curves around those things which
were originally here, or so it seems. The lane is well-shaded by the
numerous thin branches of the tall trees that have been planted on
either side of the lane here. It looks as though someone has spilled
something here recently, judging by the size of the puddle on the side
of the road here, and the even wider line to which it is apparent that
the puddle once extended. The puddle might otherwise be explained by
rain, though it has not rained for some time.

as though the road grew up along with the plants and the walls. The
apartments along this lane are tall and narrow, looking as though
squashed together, though all are in good condition. The row of
apartments are fairly varied in design aside from their similar
width. Some have obviously been here since the city was built or
rebuilt, while others appear to be much newer and in slightly better
shape. Outside of the side door of one of the buildings, someone has
placed an old tapestry, frayed to the point of losing its shape, and
worn with tracks of footprints from years of wear.

does everywhere, though here it is not so hot as it is other places,
filtered by the trees and cooled by the shade of the buildings. This
small lane that splits off the main road through Alindaer is well-paved
and fairly wide, enough for a cart and two horses to pass abreast.
There are buildings to either side, their walls worn a bit with time
but still well-kept. To the west, a window in the side of the building
gives away the occupants: it is a tavern of sorts, and when the window
is open one only has to be close enough to hear the noise coming from
inside it to know that. An older woman totters north on the east side
of the street, clutching her rather large purse to her as though it is
the most important thing to her in the world.

cart, although it is not nearly as busy as the main road. Perhaps
that is because there seems to be nothing much to see on this road:
to your east is the wall of a large building, an inn of some sort,
and to the west is a smallish building, fairly run-down, appearing to
be apartments of some sort. A few vines grow up the sides of the old
structure, so thin that they probably were not meant to be there.

Tower Street. This is one of the few places in the city where the
White Tower of Tar Valon is not visible, due to the buildings which
line Ayende Lane. The lane passes between a large four-story building
to the east and a wider, more sturdy-looking two-story building to the
west. Between the buildings to the east, you catch sight of a grey rat
scurrying into the shadows. Outside the front of one of the buildings
hangs a small bunch of red and white dried flowers, swaying slightly
in the hot, dry breeze.

of many of those passing by. Beneath the flimsy cover which the tent

their hands tightly as they excitedly point across the River Erinin to
the beautiful city walls of Tar Valon, built many years ago by Ogier

square of Tar Valon. Perhaps it is the beauty, or the mystique, or both,

city in the world. The river flows unconcernedly underneath the bridge
which passes over it to the south and east. Several docks extend into
the water from the eastern bank in Tar Valon, and a few docks reach
from the western bank, all of them south of here.

found anywhere else in the world. Along the west side of the street,
numerous wooden benches scatter themselves among the shops, inns and

to the water. Indeed, the soft sound of water lapping against boat
hulls and rocky banks permeates the area here, a bit soothing with the

energetic and ready to take on their day whatever it might bring,
while most of the people travelling look as though an unexpected
wind could push them over, at which point they would be unable
to stand back up. At the same time they look expectant somehow,
anticipating their destination and whatever it will bring.

      <roomdescription>A scrawny-looking dog trundles along the side of the road
here, keeping close to the exterior walls of the buildings
bordering River Street. The dog appears to be trotting lazily
on his way, though he jumps at the slightest sounds and gazes
hungrily at any and all passersby. Occasionally a child tosses
him a crumb or a scrap, or an adult nonchalantly drops a morsel
which the dog immediately snatches and takes with him down an
alley or between two buildings. Not all of the passersby on the
street are sympathetic to the dog&apos;s position, however; those
peddlers on the road growl at the dog as it passes, as though
they understand it somehow.

group of young boys dressed in various odds and ends they
have apparently found somewhere are pretending to be soldiers,
marching down the side of the street, earning the amused and
condescending glances of the adults who pass them by. Among
some of those glances wafts the sound of the giggling of a
larger group of girls just one or two years older than the
boys. The road continues to the east and west, every stone to
the east closer to the river Erinin and the bridge over it
which leads to the grand city of Tar Valon and the White Tower.

a beautifully stitched blue satin gown, made for the most elegant

pair of dresses of a slightly more casual tone, though they too
appear to be sharply tailored. Just a bit off to the west from
here, under the gates of Alindaer and just a short way further,
a beautiful white bridge stretches across the river Erinin to
Tar Valon. The streets here which intersect are quite busy,
packed with travellers either on their way to Tar Valon or coming
from. Many of them stop here in Alindaer to rest in one of the
many inns along these streets.

breaks out into a run, vanishing quickly down a narrow alley.
Perhaps it was after a rat; it seems like there are so many
of those everywhere nowadays. The people on the street walk
briskly to and from their tasks, seeming fairly cheery for
people going about everyday business.

a fairly quiet city compared to the huge city of Tar Valon across
the river Erinin, though for its size it is quite busy. The people
here seem content next to the grand city, and seem happy to help
all the travelers that pass through their own city each day,
offering their services to all who walk or ride by with mostly
smiles on their faces, even in these hard times. On the side of
the road a peddler cries his wares, stopping once in a while to
glare suspiciously at other peddlers who walk through the street,
as though trying to claim this street as his territory.

a straight north-south path. A few assorted shops line this road,
though the majority of the shops and inns can probably be found
on the main road through the city. These shops receive most of
their business from the many travellers who pass through this city
between Tar Valon and Caemlyn. A small tavern sits on the side of
the road to the east, its doors open and every part about it
seeming to welcome visitors from out of town. This is probably
not one of the taverns that the locals frequent, though it looks
to be of good quality.

it is difficult to tell from here, on a road on the western edge
of the city. Looking over the city to the east, the most visible
sight is a beautiful white tower stretching into the sky in the
distance. Tar Valon and the White Tower are just through the city
and across the river Erinin, and it appears that the tower dwarfs
all the other buildings in this city and that. This road is paved
and fairly smooth, though there are grooves worn in from the near
constant traffic of the wagons and carts of people travelling
between Caemlyn and Tar Valon.

through Alindaer to the roads parallel to it. Like this one, most of
these roads are almost small enough to be alleys, though some of them
are almost large enough to be main streets themselves. The rat leaves
behind an echo of a faint scratching and a light squeaking, though it

grow from the ends of the tree branches, however none of them look

There is a great number of people on this road considering its
size; one would expect the wider River Street to the north to

      <roomdescription>Lying on one side of the road here is a rather large pipe,
sitting on a medium-sized rock which appears to have been
carefully placed here to add a natural touch to this road,
appropriately named Pebble Road. It is unclear whether the
name preceded the pebbles or the opposite is true, but the
road is scattered with smallish pebbles. Those rocks make
it quite simple to differentiate the local residents from
the travellers and visitors: the locals have no difficulty
navigating the road which is lined with small and slippery
rocks. Others, however, walk a bit more carefully, and more
due to their caution than any actual slickness of the road,
falter on occasion.

      <roomdescription>To the north and west, a small gated park opens its bars of
wrought iron and spiralled silver onto the street. The park
seems to be divided into two halves, the center of one half
dominated by a rather large structure made of wood and metal
and designed for children to play on, and the other half of
tha park grounds dominated by an even larger fountain. From
this distance the finer details of the fountain&apos;s central
statue are not quite clear, though it appears to be a fish
of some unknown origin, perhaps not a real kind of fish but
just some artist&apos;s creation.

quite straight, directed toward the wide main road through
Alindaer to the north. The lane looks to be well-paved and
bordered by narrow houses and other buildings, mostly of a
uniform medium height. Pebble Road continues to the east and
west, lining a path along the southern edge of the city. On
one of the benches on the southern side of the road, a young
woman sits, looking a bit perturbed, even anxious. Beside her
on the bench is a painted box, looking as though it might
contain a hat or some other round object. In her nervousness,
the woman, her right hand on the top of the box, rolls it on
its side along the unoccupied length of the bench.

calmly among themselves. They seem to be the only ones along
the street who fail to notice the swarm of small white puffs
floating through the street on the hot breeze. They must have
been expelled from some plant seeking to distribute its seeds.
Their numbers and colors could almost fool one into thinking
that they are the frigid flakes of a snowstorm, despite the
hot, dry weather and all the other evidence to the contrary.
The spores mostly settle among the pebbles on this road to be
stomped by the ignorant feet of passersby.

in his own little world, carrying a cage or a box of some sort,
covered with cloth. From time to time he stops to set the box
down and peer underneath the cloth, as though whatever is inside
it might have escaped in the few steps he has taken since his
last investigation. Then again, knowing little boys, whatever he
has caught may well have escaped. Many of the people rushing to
and fro along this street slow in their paths to chuckle amusedly
at the boy, possibly reminiscing of better times. Despite the
stifling heat and dry wind, most of the people in this city have
a pleasant disposition, with the possible exception of some of
the most weary travellers passing through this part of Alindaer.

startled exclamations by some people on the street, it is business
as usual along the southernmost road through Alindaer. After what
seems to have been a long chase, the cat runs in a circle around a
large cart passing westwards down this road and then disappears
down the small, curving lane to the north, leaving the dog panting

wishing to leave a message for his or her beloved, or perhaps simply
lost by a careless and tired traveller not quite aware of his close
proximity to the stiff branches of the trees, its contents are small

a tavern with a water jug in her hand and begins to satisfy the thirst
of the plants in the small pots outside the door of the tavern. To
the south, a wooden sign carved with a cup of tea and a bundle of
herbs advertises perhaps an herb shop, perhaps the services of the
wise woman of this city, though it is unlikely that one would reside
so near to Tar Valon.

of Tar Valon in all its beauty. From somewhere close by, a seemingly
random set of notes is playing, six notes repeated in a scattered
pattern, and quite beautiful at that.

Here, a rare plum grows from one of the plum trees that line the
road, its fruit looking quite moist. It seems that no one wants to
pick the fruit for fear of taking it from someone else who might
want it, except for the children who gaze longingly at the plum:
for them it is quite far out of reach, on one of the higher branches.
From that same tree, some thoughtful person has hung a large set of
metal wind chimes. The breeze that seems to constantly blow these
days provides the means for the singsong notes that echo through
the east side of Pebble Road.

warm clothes considering the heat, but they do not seem to notice;
perhaps past a certain point, the amount of sweat running down the
children&apos;s backs does not matter to them. Most of the people passing
by on this street do so as though they don&apos;t notice the running
figures or the shouts, though a few travellers stop and take notice.
Just to the east, Pebble Road curves sharply to the north, and from
the signs on a pole above the street, appears to change names.

To the southeast, a small and unnamed dirt road diverges from this
intersection and appears to run mostly parallel to the Erinin, only
distancing itself from the water many spans to the south, at which
point it stops in front of what looks like perhaps a farmhouse, in
the middle of a large field. Maiden Avenue, which runs to the north
from here, is quite close to the river; in fact several people are
walking up and down its length, selling passage on one of the many
ferries that leaves from this side of the river to travel downriver
towards Tanchico and the Aryth Ocean.

wall a large fireplace bordered with gray marbled stone marks one edge
of an oval shaped by the round tables of the common room, all of which
circle the room concentrically in a horseshoe shape, opening to the
fireplace, large enough to create quite a roaring furnace when lit. The
Stone Spring is obviously frequented by a large number of the locals,
though there appears to be an equal number of visitors here who are
taking a room as they pass through this city. The locals appear to
unconsciously separate themselves from the visitors, creating quite an
interesting feeling around the room, one of both friendship and of
unfamiliarity at the same time.

people who come to watch cluster around any of the smallish elliptical
tables set up in the remaining floor space. The tables are finished
with a dark lacquer to match the chairs surrounding them. Two maids
dressed in dark red and white dresses with low-cut collars saunter
around the tables bringing food and drink to the customers, and easily
avoiding the fingers of those customers who have had just a bit too
much to drink. From time to time a gleeman performs here, trading his
services as a performer for free room and board.

the kitchen, and most of the time when customers pull up on their mounts
he has to set aside a honeycake or a tall glass of milk that one of the

hooks above the western counter, which is split in the middle by a door
to the stables, a set of ladles and spatulas hang, moving about just
slightly as though they have just been disturbed. Two assistant chefs,
perhaps the daughters of the family that owns The Stone Spring Inn,
bustle about the kitchen preparing an assortment of smaller dishes.
From here doors lead into the common room and the dining room, as well
as the door bisecting the counter to the stables to the west.

oak chairs, all darkly finished and carved just a bit so the shapes of

to be engineered around providing privacy for its occupants. A large
carved wooden door on the south wall leads to the common room, and when
it is closed it is nearly impossible to hear the rather loud commotion
that is normal in the common room. A slightly smaller door leads west
to the kitchen, as is obvious from the chefs that come and go through
that door to serve the clients dining in this room. They never enter
without first knocking, however, to avoid the embarassment of walking
in on a conversation which they should not be hearing, or an awkward

inside is mostly covered by a centered oval rug, over which the large
bed extends. A stained mahogany chest rests against the far wall, next
to an armoire of identical stain. The bedspread, a pale blue embroidered
with a simple white pattern, matches the alternating concentric ovals
in the thick rug. Resting against the wall to the west is a soft white
sitting chair and an antique carved round end table. Upon the end table
rests a few sheets of fine quality paper and a thin quill pen. In the
top drawer of the armoire is the inkwell to match, as well as three long
sticks of wax, colored red, white, and yellow, for the customer&apos;s choice

both sides of the hallway lead to rooms of varying sizes, a few fit
for nobility but most sized and furnished for a customer of average
means. Most of the rooms are full at all times of the year because
of the proximity of Alindaer to Tar Valon and the relatively low
prices of the rooms compared to the rooms available within the other
city, but there are a few rooms open. The hallways are well-kept,
dusted regularly, walls either freshly painted or freshly washed. The
last door at the end of the hall is extremely large, the handle set a
foot or so above all the others on the other doors here. Perhaps this
is an Ogier room, which would mean that everything inside that room
is sized to match the door.

      <roomdescription>Several spans wide and long, this room is extremely spacious, large
enough for two perfectly adequate rooms. Then again, that seems to be
the trademark of this inn. The room is furnished with a large bed in
the center of one wall, fitted with pale yellow sheets and a white
comforter embroidered with green vines entwined around yellow checked
outlines. The floor is carpeted with a tairen rug in green and yellow
hues, and on the wall is a painting of a scene near the sea of no shore
that you have ever seen. Perhaps the proprietor of The Stone Spring Inn
is well-traveled, or perhaps it is just an artist&apos;s fictitious creation.
Either way, the decorations here are extremely bright and luxurious,
including the exquisitely thin porcelain pitcher and bowl sitting on the
table against the south wall.

    <roombasic title="The Stables of Alindaer" vnum="15584" zone="155">
      <roomdescription>This is a rather large set of stables, with dozens of rows of stalls,
nearly all of them full; that is, all within your view. The ground is
covered with a light coating of light-covered straw, mingled with straw
of the slightly darker variety, giving a strange layered effect. Several
stablehands rush about leading horses one way or that, or mucking out a
stable on one side of the row. Just to the east a tall girl wearing a
set of breeches, a coat, and boots, hair tied back in tight red curls,
is cooing to a horse as she brushes its coat and mane. A fair amount of
sunlight seeps in through the intentional holes in the roof, which are
layered at an angle such that rain or snow would not drip onto the ground.
The hired hands here are not exactly cheery; rather they are brisk in all
their movements, moving purposefully about their tasks singlemindedly.

    <roombasic title="The Bank of Alindaer" vnum="15585" zone="155">
      <roomdescription>This building is surprisingly cool considering the recent heat wave
which has plagued the land everywhere west of the Spine of the World.
This is probably a result of the thick stone walls of which the walls
are made. Though, the walls probably were not designed to serve this
kind of purpose, but rather were designed for security. Two rather
large guards stand watch just inside the main double doors, which are
made of thick mahogany. Two more guards stand at either side of the
large counter decorated with iron bars to separate the moneychanger
from the customers. The rather large room is quite well-lit, deriving
its light from high windows near to the vaulted ceiling, and from the
subsequent reflection of that light off the white stone and tiles.

      <roomdescription>This small seamstress&apos; shop appears to be arranged by sex; that is,
the women&apos;s dresses and gowns, as well as scarves, silk and velvet
purses, and a collection of untailored fabrics all are arranged
against the walls, inviting the women to explore their section around
the outside of the shop. The men are drawn into the shop&apos;s center,
where an arrangement of breeches, coats, and well-tailored shirts
hang from darkly finished racks made of pine. Cloaks and the larger
variety of overgarmets are nearest to the counter behind which the 
seamstress sits when she is not taking orders or measurements, and
the thinner variety of undergarmets are relegated to the two back
corners of the shop, the men&apos;s section being almost as far away from
the women&apos;s section as possible. Overall the shop is quite crowded
with clothes that range in quality from an average everyday stitching
to the finest gowns and coats embroidered with a myriad of intricate
patterns.

      <roomdescription>The smell of this room is quite warm, as though it weren&apos;t hot enough
already outside. Two large stone ovens set into the back wall are kept
constantly hot by the boy sitting between them on a chair, wearing
little more than a thin white shirt and a light pair of pants. Seeing
him sweat so, it is obvious that there are hotter places in this room
than the display area just inside the door where the customers gather.
The room is divided into that area and another for the cooks and the
cooks&apos; assistants by a large glass counter, underneath which is placed
the fresh baked delights as soon as they are cool enough not to steam
up the glass terribly. It looks like a great variety of delectable
foods are available here, anything from sourberry pie to plum tart to
honeycakes to simple loaves of bread.

      <roomdescription>This is an average-looking tavern, nothing fancy-looking though not
of a lower quality. Several tables placed strategically around the room
center rings of thin-backed oak chairs, many of those tables already
set up with a small ring in which to play dice. Most of the tables are
decorated with a ring pattern, comprised of a random spacing of rings
that overlap and vary in thickness and size with the variations in the
mugs and goblets they serve drinks in here. While the pattern is most
certainly interesting, it apparently is not intentional, though it is
to be expected in a place such as this, where the customers unfailingly
leave more disoriented than when they came in. Two barmaids weave with
a practiced artistry around the tables and chairs, turning easily around
the clumsy hands of drunk customers, carrying multiple drinks of varying
sizes on their rather cluttered trays.

    <roombasic title="A Tabac Shop" vnum="15589" zone="155">
      <roomdescription>This shop has a musty smell, certainly not the smell of any distinct
kind of tobacco, but distinct in itself, the signature scent of all
tabac shops. On counters around the walls and on racks in the center
of the room, cloth-wrapped bundles ranging in size from enough to
smoke one pipe with to enough for a city council to smoke all at one
time sit in neat rows, tied off with twine and either tagged with a
label underneath them or identified by the fabric and color of the
cloth that binds the tabac. Underneath the counter near the front of
the store, several different exquisitely-crafted pipes are arranged
for display, to encourage the last-minute consideration of those who
have come merely to replenish their stock of their favorite tabac.
More pipes line the walls, each balancing on its own two pegs, though
those are somewhat less expensive.

      <roomdescription>A thick layer of grass on the ground extends all the way from the wall
of this small park to the east, to the fountain just to the west and
beyond, up to the wall of a small building on the other side of that
fountain. The combination of the slightly dampened sound of rushing
water and the louder sound of children contentedly playing is quite
calming, except for the occasional upset shouts of a child for whom
the game everyone has been playing is not proceeding according to plan.
A peddler wanders throughout the park, meandering around the children&apos;s
fortress that springs from the ground in a haphazard collection of
beams and railings, stopping to take a drink of water from the small
bottle he is carrying, and then continuing to wander his way to the
fountain, walking on the first step of its rim so that he is just a
bit more visible than all the other visitors to the park.

    <roombasic title="Amyrlin Park" vnum="15591" zone="155">
      <roomdescription>The dominant form of the scene here is this large fountain, made from
stone and metal. The pool looks to be about three feet deep, formed by
carved smooth white stone marbled with a dark, dark grey, almost black.
The rim of the fountain is easily large enough to sit on, and is itself
ringed with two fairly wide steps which make the fountain seem as though
it rose from the ground in three distinct stages and make it a popular
place for children to play, though less popular than the structure to
the west, which seems to have been designed just for children. At some
point the white stone turns to a silvery metal, though it is difficult
to tell exactly where. The metal forms itself into a strange figure,
a fish of some kind, though nothing recognizable. The fish is long and
thin, almost wafer-like, though its body puffs out as it reaches up here
toward the sky and opens its mouth to gush cool, clear water. Its two
fins are quite thin as well, and seem forever locked in a ripple.

      <roomdescription>This is a small dirt path, well-packed and surprisingly moist given
the climate lately. Very little dust stirs with your footprints nor
does any with the light breeze that sweeps through here, dulled by
the cover of trees and bushes and buildings and cooled by not only
those same barriers but by the cool waters of the fountain which
rises from the ground a bit further into the park. To the south, the
path opens onto a wide paved road, announcing its entrance by way of
a wide border of blue and white tiles, arranged on the ground in a
nondistinct geometrical pattern. The sound of running water is just
a bit more penetrating here than the sounds of children involved in
a happy game or play of some sort, though both come from the general
northwest direction.

      <roomdescription>This room has a somewhat bitter smell to it, though it is not at all
unpleasant, but rather fresh and somewhat reminiscent of nature. Along
the walls of this fairly roomy shop, dozens of nails have been hammered
into the pine walls, and tied to each of those nails save perhaps two
or three is a bundle of herbs, each at some point in the drying process.
While the room is fairly wide and there is ample floor space for the
sale of herbs and potions, the ceiling is fairly low; certainly an Ogier
could not stand up straight here, nor perhaps could some of the tallest
of men. A mortar and pestle sit on the counter that sits to the left of
the door upon entering, connecting the north and east walls with a short
diagonal. Behind that counter, a woman of middle age sits, calmly gazing
upon those who enter. Most of the people who come in here do not know
exactly what they are looking for, but rather they know the effect they
desire.

layer of brush, the plants a bit wilted but no less green for the dry
heat that wilted them. In a few places the plants have sprouted flowers
of various colors, generally smaller in size. The ground here is quite
surprisingly moist considering the recent weather, a pleasant change
from the dusty unpaved roads surrounding the city of Alindaer. From
this point the White Tower of Tar Valon is just barely visible, its
topmost tip peeking out from the tops of the trees that shade the area
here. From the south, the sounds of rushing water and the slightly
softer sounds of children&apos;s voices indicate that the main area of the
park is nearby.

      <roomdescription>Just to the north, the bustle of the main street through Alindaer is
quite apparent, but here the paved road gives way to a quiet, shaded
dirt path which curves around a large oak tree to the south. The tree
looks as though it could be hundreds of years old by its size and the
radius and thickness of its roots. A few children play on it, but there
seems to be a greater concentration of children further south, judging
by the sounds that drift up from that area. From this point the White
Tower of Tar Valon is just barely visible, its topmost tip peeking out
from the tops of the trees that shade the area here. The ground here is
surprisingly moist considering the recent weather, a pleasant change
from the dusty unpaved roads surrounding the city of Alindaer. Perhaps
the moistness is due to the source of rushing water that is just barely
audible to the south and east.
