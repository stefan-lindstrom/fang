    <description>This old man looks swathed in a long robe the same changing colors of the
fog behind him. He has thickly stranded white hair and a long snowy beard
and stands perhaps six feet tall. Despite the aged lines on his face, his
brown eyes sparkle with youthful curiosity and an exuberance for life. He
has a nearly constant smile on his face, appearing friendly and helpful.

hair and a long flowing beard. His robe seems to have settled to a simple
hue of grey, and it covers him all the way to the floor so that if he moves
he almost looks like he is floating. He holds a long, commonplace walking
stick in his left hand, fingers resting comfortably. His expression is one
of a man with an eternity of patience.

There is a wisdom in his face, and he smiles amiably.

    <description>Moving much slower than the other animals in the field to enjoy the warm
sun, the hedgehog ambles along without a care. If scared, he curls
up into a little ball, exposing his spiny backside to ward off would-be
predators wanting a meal. Otherwise, his little nose snuffles around
between the grasses, searching for nuts or bugs.

it perch in safety as it bloats out its mouth to breathe and also
sound a call to other frogs in the woods now and again.

  <mobile vnum="1947" name="Haral Luhhan blacksmith" special="NONE">
    <description>Haral, the village&apos;s best and only blacksmith, is perhaps the largest
man in the district. His shoulders are at least an axe hilt thick, his
bare arms rippling with muscles from under the rolled up sleeves. The
width of his chest well rivals the size of his girth; his wife certainly
keeps him healthily fed. Though he is a strong man, he usually has a
warm smile on his face, belying any danger from the heavy hammer
hanging from his belt.

    <description>Alsbet easily matches her husband Haral in size, her dress pulled
snugly around her roundness. Yet she does not have the least bit of

She often has some kind of cooking utensil in one hand that looks like
it could easily land on some grumbling man&apos;s head if her weren&apos;t careful.
She wears a used apron around her waist, the stains a mix of cooking
and also forging, indicative of the help she sometimes offers her husband.

    <description>Tad is shorter than Hu and has slightly lighter hair and an even
more silent disposition. But he works equally as hard and seems to
have been a good investment by Master al&apos;Vere. He wears simple
clothes and heavy boots and often has a lead rope or feed bag
draped over his shoiulder on its way to one of the horses in the
stables.

    <description>One of Bran&apos;s best work horses, this Dhurran is at least eighteen
hands high. Dark brown in color with a few white socks and a stripe
of white down its nose, the horse looks like it can pull a plow
better than any in the district. It has wide shoulders and thick
legs, hair coverings its hooves, and a surprisingly placid disposition.

  <mobile vnum="1960" name="Tam al&apos;Thor trainer" special="Trainer">
    <description>Tam is one of the sheep farmers just outside of Emond&apos;s Field, and a
single man at that, much to the delight of goodwives with sisters. His
hair is mostly grey now, with only a sprinkling of black, and his
broad, sun-tanned face is lined, but the man stands stolidly. He has
a broad chest and a way of standing that makes him appear more like
stone than weak flesh and bone. The sword he uses to train with can
swing easily in his hands, proving he knows how to use it.
