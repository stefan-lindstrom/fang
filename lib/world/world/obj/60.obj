was little use to its wearer.

2.SIMPLE
&amp;n
&amp;CContinued from SIMPLE
&amp;n
Warm Room: This is a complex web of fine threads of Fire used to  warm  the
air.  This weave should not be tied off and left unattended,  lest  it  get
out of hand and start a fire. 
&amp;c
Jane's breath is visible  in  the  chill  air  of  her  bedchamber  as  she
concentrates on spinning out the fine tendrils of  Fire  until  they  reach
all corners of the room. After just a few moments, the room is toasty warm.
She releases the weave and finally slips out from beneath her heavy,  down-
filled comforter. 
&amp;n
Shape Stone: Flows of Earth can be used to  rearrange  the  composition  of
dirt, metal or stone in order to reshape it.  Basically,  it  is  sculpting
using just the One  Power.   Size  of  the  task  affects  the  difficulty.
Bending a sword blade would probably not be very hard,  especially  if  you
just make the metal soft and malleable in  one  small  spot  and  then  use
flows of air for the actual bending.  Rearranging a large  boulder  into  a
statue would be a good deal more difficult, and the One  Power  in  no  way
guarantees artistic ability. 
&amp;c
Virine studies the marble plaque, a smirk of contempt  marring  her  coldly
beautiful features.  She carefully weaves light flows  of  Earth  into  the
stone, gradually smoothing away the inscription.  In  mere  moments,  Joe's
engraved protestations of undying love are no more. 
&amp;n
Delve Ores: Probing flows of earth are used to find and  identify  ores  in
the ground. The ability is very rare in women. 
&amp;c
After several moments of carefully probing the closed box's  contents  with
threads of Earth, Jane looks up and announces,  &quot;It  contains  a  piece  of
coal, a copper farthing and a silver mark.&quot;
&amp;n
Dry: Flows of water can be used to move moisture  out  of  hair,  clothing,
etc.  This is probably the most common use to which simple weaves of  Water
are put in the books. 
&amp;c
Jane weaves threads of Water carefully  through  Joe's  drenched  clothing,
drawing the moisture out and causing it to gather in a  pool  at  his  feet
leaving his fancy, silk coat dry, but ruined. 
&amp;n
Move Water: Flows of Water can be used to  move  liquid  around.   This  is
useful for gathering up a spill or stirring. 
&amp;c
Jane channels flows of Water into the  puddle,  causing  it  to  gather  up
into a quivering ball about the size of her head.   Gently,  she  lifts  it
with a cradling web of Air and slowly moves it  to  the  window  where  she
releases   it,   allowing   it   to   splash   onto   the   ground   below.
&amp;n
Create Water: Flows of water can be used to coax  moisture  from  the  air.
The difficulty would be determined by how humid the air  is  and  how  much
water one is attempting to create.  This would not be terribly  easy,  even
under ideal circumstances. 
&amp;c
Jane concentrates and forms a web made of tendrils of Water,  radiating  to
all corners of the room, but centered over her small  tea  cup.   She  uses
the weave to gradually coax moisture from the air of the  room,  along  the
weave to the cup.  After a few moments, droplets of  water  begin  to  fall
from  the  center  of  the  web  into   the   cup,   slowly   filling   it.
&amp;n
Ball of Light: Air is used to form  the  hollow  shell  or  ball.   A  fine
thread of Fire is then looped  inside  the  shell  to  produce  the  light.
&amp;c
Jane holds her hands in front of her about a  foot  apart  with  the  palms
facing each other. She spins out a thread of Air and weaves it into a mesh-
like ball in the middle of the space between  her  hands.   Carefully,  she
inserts a thin filament of Fire  into  the  hollow  sphere  and  loops  it,
pulsing energy along the thread causing the entire construct to  glow  with
a soft light.

SIMPLE
&amp;n
The purpose of this document is to list some  simple  weaves  or  uses  for
the One Power that would be likely taught early in  the  training  so  that
the guild  can  have  standard  examples  of  how  these  should  be  done.
&amp;n
Harden Air: Flows of Air used to form a hard surface.   This  can  be  used
for various things.  Flows of air tightly woven into a hard disc  can  form
a shield to deflect blows.  The same type of barrier can  be  expanded  out
to form a wall.  Offensively, hardened air can be formed into  a  club  for
use as a weapon. It can also be formed into a switch or whiplike construct. 
&amp;c
Viegl channels flows of Air into a tightly spun disc.  There  is  a  slight
shimmering in front of him as the air hardens just in time to  deflect  the
incoming stone. 
&amp;n
Bind: Bands of air can be used to immobilize a target or  to  hold  objects
in place.  Combined with hardened air, it can be used to gag, blindfold  or
stop the ears of a target. 
&amp;c
Jane channels out thick bands of Air, attempting to loop  them  around  Joe
and pin his arms to his sides. 
&amp;n
Lift: This is the most common use for Air.  It is similar to  bind,  except
that once the target is &quot;grabbed&quot;  it  is  then  lifted.   Weight  directly
affects difficulty.  The heavier the target and the higher  it  is  lifted,
the more power is required.  Lifting a person is difficult, although it  is
doable, especially by someone who  is  strong  enough  to  gate.   However,
lifting them more than a couple of yards would be a herculean  task  unless
the person is small or the  channeler  is  of  Forsaken  caliber  strength.
&amp;c
Jane wraps flows of Air tightly around the kettle.  Slowly  and  carefully,
she lifts it from the table, the glow of Saidar around  her  increasing  in
intensity  as  she  begins  to  draw  more  deeply  on   the   One   Power.
&amp;n
Heat: Thin flows of Fire are woven into an object to  heat  it.   Excellent
for heating water for tea. 
&amp;c
Jane channels thin  threads  of  Fire,  passing  them  through  the  kettle
slowly and carefully until a thin stream of steam begins to rise  from  the
spout. 
&amp;n
Flame: A single thread  of  Fire  is  looped  or  twisted  at  the  end  to
concentrate it and produce a visible flame. 
&amp;c
Jane holds her hands cupped in front of her and channels a  slender  thread
of Fire into the hollow formed by her fingers.  She forms the  thread  into
a loop and gradually increases the intensity of  the  flow  until  a  small
flame appears and flickers above her palms. 
&amp;n
Ignite: A single flow of Fire is inserted into the target,  causing  it  to
burst into flames. 
&amp;c
Viegl seizes Saidin and channels a fine flow of Fire,  pushing  it  into  a
log in the fireplace.  The thread thickens as he pumps more energy into it.
Suddenly the log bursts into flame.

THREADS
&amp;n
The five threads or powers of Saidin and Saidar are  Fire,  Earth,  Spirit,
Water and Air.  This lesson is just a  very  brief  introduction  to  these
five threads with a little information on the uses of each.  They  will  be
covered more fully later. 
&amp;n
&amp;RFire&amp;n controls heat and light energy.  It is one of  the  threads  in  which
men are more likely to have strength. 
&amp;n
&amp;yEarth&amp;n controls cohesion and movement in solids.  It is another thread  that
men are likely to have a knack for. 
&amp;n
&amp;WSpirit&amp;n deals directly with aspects of the  One  Power  and  the  fabric  of
reality.  Men and women are supposedlyequally  likely  to  have  facility
with Spirit. 
&amp;n
&amp;bWater&amp;n controls cohesion  and  manipulation  of  liquids.   Women  are  more
likely to have Water as their strength. 
&amp;n
&amp;CAir&amp;n controls kinetic energy and wind movement.  Women are  more  likely  to
have Air as their strength.

(&amp;CContinued from embrace&amp;n)

Releasing the One Power is rather simple.  One merely lets it go.  The only 
difficulty is in  wanting to let it go.  That will be  addressed more fully 
later when dangers of channeling are discussed. An example of releasing: 
&amp;c
The golden aura around Ekaterina  dims and fades out as she releases Saidar 
with a soft sigh and a slightly wistful expression on her face. 
&amp;n
Channeling comes with some inherent dangers.  Saidar is addictive.  Holding 
the Power fills one  with a sense of well-being  and ecstasy.  Saidar has a 
sweetness that causes  one to want to draw more and more of it.  There is a 
point where the pleasure starts to turn to pain.  This is the limit of what 
one can safely hold.  Drawing any more runs the risk of burning out, losing 
the ability to channel forever,  or dying.  This same sweetness that causes 
one to want  to draw more deeply on  Saidar also causes  one to not want to 
part from it. If a woman does not gradually build up a tolerance, she could 
become addicted, wanting nothing but to hold Saidar.  The extreme stages of 
this addiction lead to headaches,  then comas,  then death.  This is one of 
the reasons that recruits are kept shielded when not actually in lessons.
&amp;n
Channeling while fatigued is dangerous, as well.  If tired, a channeler can 
lose control  of the Power with  results from merely  losing their grasp to 
burning out and dying. Channeling while tired is further complicated by the 
fact that channeling is  in itself a tiring activity,  a deceptively tiring 
one. The rush that  one feels from holding the  Power makes it difficult to 
notice how much it is fatiquing her.

&amp;gEMBRACE
&amp;n
&amp;WGrasping, Releasing, and Dangers of Channeling Saidar
&amp;n
Grasping and releasing the One Power is something a femme Dreadlord will do
very often.   In fact, it will be done so often as to become a very trivial 
part of one's channeling emotes. 
&amp;n
In Robert Jordan's world,  it could take weeks or even months for a girl to 
become  competent  at  embracing  the  One Power,  depending on her natural 
aptitude for it and whether or not she had sparked.   For most people, role 
playing these weeks or  months of trying to embrace, but failing, is boring 
to say the least.  If someone actually wants to roleplay such things,  that 
is her decision.  For most, however, this will be part of their character's 
assumed history.  If the player can  demonstrate a  competence with emoting 
this, it will be  assumed that her character  spent the  necessary time and 
practice. She may request to be tested on this whenever she feels ready. If
she passes, she will have her grasp and release skills set to 70%. 
&amp;n
In the books,  many different relaxation  and visualization  techniques are 
described for getting into a proper state of mind to embrace Saidar.  These 
can be useful  if one is RPing the lesson.  However, they will likely never 
be used outside this lesson. Since it is generally accepted that one should 
not  put  thoughts  into one's emotes,  there is little  purpose  to  these 
techniques other than to give one background information and perhaps aid in 
the feel of Jordan's rich world.  For the sake of brevity, only the rosebud 
technique will be discussed here. 
&amp;n
The student should visualize herself as a tightly closed rosebud and Saidar 
as the sun.  She should imagine  turning towards the sun and slowly opening 
her petals to soak in the sunlight,  allowing Saidar to flow into her.  The 
important concept  in this is the  passivity of the student.  Saidar should 
never be forced. One has to surrender to Saidar to control it. Women do not 
grasp the one power,  they embrace it.  They do not force it to their will. 
They gently guide while allowing it to do their bidding. This is all useful 
background material, but difficult to use in an emote. An emote should only 
include those things which can be sensed by the audience. The Wheel of Time 
world doesn't have telepathy, so the audience cannot sense that the student 
is imagining herself as a rosebud.   Her facial expressions and posture can 
be seen. Any noises she makes can be heard. Other women channelers can feel 
her channel and see a soft golden glow around her when she holds the power. 
The intensity  of the glow will  increase or  decrease with  the amount she 
holds. These are things that can be included in the emote. An example: 
&amp;c
Ekaterina takes a deep breath. As she slowly releases it, her face takes on 
a serene expression,  her muscles relaxing  and smoothing.  For those women 
present who  can  channel, a soft, golden  nimbus  surrounds  her as she is 
slowly filled with Saidar. 
&amp;n
The previous  example is  not a bad  emote for someone just learning to use 
the One Power. Embracing is still a difficult task  which requires time and 
concentration. As the student gains more practice, the Power will come more 
easily.  Eventually the  student will  be able to  embrace without thought, 
forming weaves almost instantly after embracing.  The act of embracing will 
become a rather trivial part of the channeling emote. An example: 
&amp;c
Ekaterina is  surrounded by  a golden aura,  visible to other women who can 
channel, which grows brighter as she draws more deeply upon Saidar. 
&amp;n

&amp;gSEIZE
&amp;n
Grasping and releasing the One Power  is a rather trivial part of an emote. 
It is quite important to channeling, just not that big a part of the emote. 
&amp;n
To begin, one enters the oneness.  Once inside the void,  one will notice a 
sort of shimmering  or shining  just outside the void.  This is Saidin.  To 
grasp,  one merely  reaches out  with his  mind and  &quot;seizes&quot; this shining. 
Channeling Saidin is a constant struggle.  If one does not maintain control 
over it at all times, he can find himself burned out or even killed. Saidin 
is not very forgiving.  This constant  struggle to control the Power is one 
of the reasons  that it is incredibly  dangerous to  channel when fatigued. 
This danger is further exacerbated by the fact that channeling itself tends 
to fatigue one.  One of the  benefits of  allegiance  to the  Great Lord is 
protection from the taint. A Dreadlord never  has to worry with taint RP or 
emoting being revulsed by the vileness of it.
&amp;n
There are many differences  between the way a men and women channel.  While 
women that  channel can sense  the ability  in other  women, a man can only 
sense the ability in another man if that man is actually holding the power. 
It takes a test to discover whether or not a man has the ability to channel 
and  requires his  cooperation.  Additionally, female channelers will see a 
glow around another woman that is holding the Power. Men are not surrounded 
by a glow when they channel.  Other male channelers will  &quot;feel&quot; when a man 
is holding the power,  but they will not see it, although they will see his 
weaves  when he channels.  A male channeler can tell  how much of the power 
another man is holding by how strongly he senses it. One similarity between 
Saidin and Saidar is the sweetness,  the addictive quality.  The feeling of 
vitality and joy  associated with wielding Saidin  is so strong that one is 
usually loathe to release it. A sample:
&amp;c
Gregor holds onto Saidin. A feeling of menace rolls off him in waves sensed 
only by other  men that can channel  and grows stronger as he pulls more of 
the One Power into himself. 
&amp;n
In order to release the One Power a man must force it away from himself, as
if pushing it. This is as much a struggle as grasping to start with. Still, 
the Power  can slip  from one's grasp  accidentally.  It requires effort to 
keep grasping as well as effort  to release in a controlled manner.  Losing 
one's grasp accidentally carries a risk of burning out. An example emote: 
&amp;c
With effort, Gregor pushes Saidin away from himself,  the feeling of menace 
around him fading as the Power leaves him.

Rules of the Camp
&amp;n
1. Always obey your superiors and show proper respect.  Bow or curtsey when
a superior enters your presense.  Do the same when greeting and leaving the
presense of a superior.
&amp;n
2. Do not leave  the camp unless  you have the  rank of at least Dreadlord. 
You are not permitted to take anyone of a rank lower than Initiate from the 
camp.
&amp;n
3. Do -NOT- attract  notice to  yourself or  advertise your  true abilities 
outside the camp.  You are left  to your own  discretion on this matter but 
know that if you  are found to be failing  in your duties  or otherwise are 
displeasing, you will be dealt with.
&amp;n
4. The Master Dreadlord's word is law,  allowing him to circumvent any rule 
he wishes, or adding as he sees fit. 
&amp;n
NOTE: Breaking the rules is a bad idea.  Dreadlords are not coddled such as
the Aes Sedai are.  Scrubbing pots is  much less likely to be assigned as a
punishment than is being the contents of said pots.

&amp;gONENESS
&amp;n
Channeling Saidin requires extreme concentration. It is a constant struggle
requiring the wielder to remain focused.   If a wielder becomes distracted,
even for a moment, he can lose control and be killed or have the ability to
channel  burned out  of him.   The oneness  is a technique  for maintaining 
concentration  and  avoiding  distractions.   It is almost  a necessity for 
learning to control Saidin. In the old tongue it is called Cho di. Those of
the modern age call it the flame and the void.
&amp;n
One concentrates on imagining a flame in his mind. He then imagines feeding
his stray thoughts  and emotions into  this flame until nothing is left but 
an empty void.   This is difficult at first, but with practice the void can 
be formed  almost instantly.  Some of the  effects of being in the void are 
the ability to ignore pain and  other distractions as well as a distinctive 
emotionless quality. When someone is in the void, his voice will tend to be
cold  and  flat,  although  it is  possible  to overcome  this with  enough 
practice.
&amp;n
For some, the void can be a difficult thing to RP. It is generally accepted
on Fang that one should not  put his thoughts and emotions into his emotes. 
Since the oneness is purely a mental trick,  this presents some problems in 
RP.   It is generally considered best to just roleplay the effects of being 
in the void. Some examples:
&amp;c
Gregor's face  goes slack  and his eyes cold as he enters the oneness.  His 
voice comes out  cold and flat as he says,  &quot;Fail  me once more and I shall 
personally serve you to the trollocs.&quot;
&amp;n
An example of how not to do it:
&amp;c
Bob forms  an image  of  a bright flame  in his mind  and slowly  feeds his 
emotions and stray thoughts into it.  An expression of calm gradually comes 
over his  face as  the flame  burns away  all distractions  then fades away 
leaving only the empty void. 
&amp;n
The previous example is  not necessarily a bad emote.  It just goes against 
the commonly  accepted standards  for RP on Fang.  It is generally accepted 
that one should not describe his thoughts, since the audience has no way of 
knowing these things.
&amp;n
The examples  of the right  way are not  necessarily perfect, either.  Each 
student should develope a style with which he is comfortable. The important
things to portray are that one usually appears emotionless when in the void 
and that he is able to avoid being distracted by pain or turmoil, yet still 
be aware of them.

ANGREAL
&amp;n
Angreal:
Angreal are objects that allow a channeler to safely draw more of  the  One
Power than he or she normally can.  In  addition  to  increasing  how  much
power  she  can  hold,  an  angreal  acts  as  a  buffer  to  help  prevent
overdrawing.  Angreal are specific to either Saidar or Saidin.  If one  can
be used by a woman, then it will be useless to a man and vice  versa.   The
angreal provided in the guild equipment are entirely OOC.   Barring  quests
or  extremely  unlikely   RP,   IC   angreal   will   not   be   possessed.
&amp;n
In order to use an angreal, one would  embrace  almost  as  normal,  except
that he or she  would  draw  the  Power  through  the  angreal  instead  of
directly.  In the books, it is never really  described  more  clearly  than
this.    In   roleplay,   this   is   incredibly   simple.    An   example:
&amp;c
Jane holds the small heartstone rose in the palm of her hand  and  embraces
the One Power, drawing Saidar through the rose.  The  golden  glow  springs
up immediately around her, much brighter  than  usual  as  she  holds  well
more Power than she can unaided. 
&amp;n
Identifying angreal is not complex.   If  a  woman  trained  in  channeling
touches a female angreal, she will instantly know its nature.  There is  no
known way for her to identify a male angreal, however.  A  man  would  have
the same ability to detect male angreal  and  inability  to  detect  female
angreal.
&amp;n
Sa'angreal:
Sa'angreal are similar to angreal, but much more  powerful.   A  Sa'angreal
would allow a person to hold as much more  power  than  an  angreal  as  an
angreal would allow him or her to hold over being unaided.  They  are  used
in exactly the same manner as angreal. 
&amp;n
Ter'angreal:
Instead  of  aiding  a  channeler  in  using  the  Power,  ter'angreal  are
designed to perform specific tasks.  Some of them work only for  men,  some
only for women, some for both, and some do not require  channeling  ability
at all.  An incredibly wide  range  of  functions  can  be  performed  with
ter'angreal.  This causes it to be extremely dangerous to tinker  with  one
if its function is not understood.  People have been  injured,  stilled  or
even killed by experimenting on strange ter'angreal.

BLOCKS
&amp;n
Any female wilder who has managed to survive the  learning  to  channel  on
her own has block  of  some  sort.   This  will  be  some  sort  of  mental
restriction.  Some examples are only being able to channel when singing  or
only in the presense of pretty boys or not at all if  around  women.   This
is not, of  course,  the  full  list.   They  should  be  tailored  to  the
individual.  The same is true of  breaking  the  blocks.   It  is  strongly
suggested that if the player does not already have  a  good  idea  for  how
the block should be broken, she likely should not play a wilder.   Training
RP, especially for females, can be  difficult  to  find  sometimes  in  the
Dreadlord guild.  Also, breaking of blocks in the Camp is not  as  pleasant
or coddling an experience as with the Aes Sedai.  Beatings and torture  are
common techniques.  In any event, a character with a  block  will  need  to
have this block broken before advancing any  in  her  channeling  training.
Grasp and Release cannot be raised above 50% until  the  block  is  broken.

CHOSEN
&amp;n
This is what the Aes Sedai know (or think they know) about the Chosen.   Be
well aware that the Chosen do not, for the most part, like to  be  reminded
of their old names.  Any actual information on the Chosen will have  to  be
gained from them personally.  This  is  not  recommended  as  they  do  not
respond well to curiosity.
&amp;n
Lanfear: The first of the Chosen to swear to the shadow was  Mierin  Sedai,
a woman who was Lews Therin's childhood lover.  She  burned  with  ambition
and lust for power.  Disgusted with  her  aspirations  Lews  Therin  turned
away from her and fell into the arms of his eventual wife, Ilyena  Moerell.
Unsuccessful in her attempts  to  recapture  Lews  Therin's  heart,  Mierin
turned away from the light, forswore her oaths as a protector of  all  that
was good and swore her allegiance to Shai'tan, her  new  and  dark  master.
After swearing her  new  oaths  she  would  always  be  known  as  Lanfear,
Daughter of the Night. 
&amp;n
Semirhage: Semirhage was one of the most powerful healers of the  age,  her
skill and  notoriety  known  throughout  the  world.   After  bringing  her
patients back from the brink of death she would extract a price from  them,
torture, for her own pleasure.  The Hall of Servants gave her an  ultimatum
of either being stilled and outcast, or being bound in some  way  with  the
power, leading a life of contemplation and being able to  see  the  end  of
life approach.  She was one of the first women to flee to  the  Dark  Lord,
and forswear her oaths to the Light. 
&amp;n
Mesaana:  Saine  Tarasind  was  a  teacher,  but  wanted  to  do  research.
Unfulfilled, Saine  turned  to  the  Shadow.   Mesaana  proved  herself  an
adequate general, but was brilliant as a governor of  conquered  territory.
Her administrations were efficient, and she started  schools  which  taught
children to spy and report on each other. 
&amp;n
Graendal: Graendal was certainly  the  most  decadent  and  flashy  of  the
Chosen.  However, prior to turning to the Shadow,  Kamarike  Mardim  Nindar
lived a simple life.  She helped heal mentally ill patients who  could  not
be helped by Healing or the One Power.  Serving the  darkness,  her  skills
with the mind were turned towards  Compulsion.   Very  few  could  hold  to
their will when facing her. 
&amp;n
Moghedien: The Chosen Moghedien turned to the Shadow long  before  the  War
of Power actually began.  However,  she  joined  Lews  Therin's  staff  and
gained a position of high standing.  Several disasters  early  in  the  war
were the result of her work.  Originally, she  was  called  Lillen  Morial.
Her   greatest   talent    was    her    expertise    in    Tel'aran'rhiod.
&amp;n
Demandred: The life of Demandred can be summed up with a  brief  statement.
He was always second.  He never gained any significant fame for the  Light,
or was exalted for miracles he performed.  The reason  for  this  was  Lews
Therin.  Next to the Dragon, Demandred was just another Aes Sedai,  but  if
the Dragon had not been born Demandred would have been  the  most  powerful
man of the age.  Always envying Lews Therin's fame  and  glory,  he  turned
bitter,  and  fled  to  Shai'tan  to  swell  the  ranks  of   the   Shadow.
&amp;n
Ishamael:Before turning to the  Shadow,  Ishamael's  name  was  Elan  Morin
Tedronai.  Ishamael means 'Betrayer of Hope' in the  Old  Tongue.   He  was
also known as Baalzamon, Heart of the Dark, and Soul  of  the  Shadow.   He
was  a  philosopher,  and  one   of   the   strongest   male   Aes   Sedai.
&amp;n
Rahvin: Little of Rahvin's life before turning to the Shadow is known.   He
was named Ared Mosinel. Rahvin's major weakness was his fondness for women.
He was also susceptible to flattery.  He prefered politics to war, and  was
a user of Compulsion.

Sammael: Known as  Tel  Janin  Aellinsar,  Sammael  was  a  world  renowned
sportsman and general in Lews Therin's army.  In  the  midst  of  a  battle
against the shadow he turned to the dark one and became Sammael.  He  wears
a scar that was never healed, and will wear it until he defeats the Dragon. 
&amp;n
Be'lal: Be'lal was originally  known  as  Duram  Laddel  Cham,  and  was  a
better manipulator than Rahvin and more skillful than  Sammael  in  dealing
with enemies in open conflict. He too served with the armies of the light,
and later turned to the Dark One. 
&amp;n
Asmodean: Before  turning  to  the  Shadow,  Joar  Addam  Nessosin  was  an
accomplished musician.  He later became Asomdean.   Asmodean  was  never  a
general for any army, though he  did  serve  as  a  governor  of  conquered
territories.  Perhaps one of his greatest atrocities  was  the  revenge  he
took against the world's most famous musicians and artists.   Asmodean  had
these artists maimed so they would never again be  able  to  perform  their
art, then released them. 
&amp;n
Aginor: The man called Aginor was the second  most  powerful  of  the  male
Chosen.  He was originally named Ishar Morrad Chuain, and was  one  of  the
foremost biological scientists of the Age of Legends.  He created  most  of
the shadowspawn. 
&amp;n
Balthamel: Before turning to  the  Shadow,  Eval  Ramman  was  a  historian
unable to distinguish himself enough to earn the coveted  third  name.   He
specialized in the study  of  vanished  cultures,  but  his  work  was  not
outstanding.  Eval had a bad temper, which almost caused him  to  be  bound
with the One Power.  As Balthamel he was well liked by  women  and  set  up
camps breeding humans as trolloc food.  He turned because he wanted  to  be
immortal.

EMOTECHAN

This OOC lesson should teach the student how to work out  on  his  her  own
how to emote weaves not specifically  taught  in  the  syllabus.   Examples
would be freezing water or putting out a fire.   All  the  possible  weaves
cannot be covered in this lesson.  That -is-  sort  of  the  point  of  the
lesson.
&amp;n
This lessons is best done with a teacher.   This  is  not  always  possible
given the inactivity in the guild at times.  If the student  is  unable  to
find a teacher and wishes to simply read addition  material  to  learn  the
subject on his or her own, said material is  available  upon  request  from

FDETECT
&amp;n
As the student's ability with the  One  Power  grows,  she  will  gradually
reach a point where she is able to sense  the  same  ability  within  other
women.  This ability would not likely show up until the  student  is  fully
competent with embracing and releasing the One Power.   In  game  terms,  a
student is set with the code skill for this, test, when she  is  raised  to
Initiate. 
&amp;n
It is easier to sense the ability in  one  who  is  trained.   It  is  also
possible to gain a rough idea of the person's strength  in  the  One  Power
relative to one's own.  For those who are untrained, it is possible to  get
an idea of their potential strength.  One can also tell if the  young  girl
is teachable or if she has the  spark  inborn.   The  books  never  discuss
exactly how this is  done.   There  are  indications  that  if  a  girl  is
teachable,  but  has  not  yet  channeled,  that  it  requires  testing  to
determine that she has the ability.  Some think this is done in  a  similar
way to how men test, but that is just speculation at this  point.   If  the
girl is sparked or has already channeled, the  ability  can  be  sensed  in
her without elaborate testing.
&amp;n
This is not a very long range ability. If a woman is not holding the Power,
another woman would not be able to sense the ability in her  at  more  than
five or six feet(approx.  two meters) away.  If one  is  not  paying  close
attention,  it  is  difficult  to  tell  at   more   than   arm's   length.
&amp;n
Use of the One Power can be sensed much  further  away,  depending  on  how
much is used.  Since women trained in the use of  Saidar  can  see  a  glow
around other women who are holding the Power, then she  would  be  able  to
notice another woman in her line of sight channeling as  far  away  as  she
could see her.  If line of sight  is  not  possible,  the  exact  range  of
detection is harder  to  determine.   As  a  rough  guide,  if  someone  is
channeling in a building the size of an inn, and the  amount  channeled  is
not purposely miniscule, another woman  trained  in  channeling  should  be
able to detect it. 
&amp;n
A woman cannot sense a man channeling or test for the ability in  him.   It
is known that ter'angreal exist which  will  detect  channeling  of  either
gender. The ones in Far Madding are known by the Aes Sedai to do just this.
Thus, it is possible that a  weave  exists  for  a  woman  to  detect  male
channeling.  If so, then the Chosen will know of it, but they do not  share
that knowledge with us.

HEALING 
&amp;n
This is a complex web of Water, Spirit and Air.  It is woven into a  gauze-
like weave that is passed through the patient's body.  Once this  weave  is
learned, one's ability with it is determined purely by his  or  her  talent
for Healing.  The talent is a sliding scale, ranging  from  those  who  can
only heal bruises to those who are able  to  fan  the  slightest  spark  of
life back to full health.  Although the talent seems to have a wide  range,
the effects of the weave are more of a toggle switch than a scale.  If  the
patient's wounds are within the ability of  the  channeler  to  Heal,  then
the patient is fully healed by the weave.   If  the  wound  is  beyond  the
channeler's ability, the patient is not healed at all.  The wound in Rand's
side is an exception to this rule.  This  is  such  an  exception  that  it
has visibly shocked every Aes Sedai to encounter  it,  even  through  their
fabled serenity.  Unless the slight delay would risk  the  patient's  life,
it is a good idea to Delve him or her first.  There  are  more  details  in
the description of the Delve weave below. 
&amp;c
Jane grasps Joe's head firmly in her hands.  She  channels  flows  of  Air,
Water and Spirit, weaving them into a complex, gauze-like  structure  which
she moves throughout his body.  As the weave passes through him, the  flesh
behind it writhes as the wounds knit closed. 
&amp;n
Delve: Thin probing flows of Spirit are used to search  through  a  patient
and diagnose any injuries.  It is generally better  to  delve  the  subject
before Healing to determine the extent of the injuries so  that  the  weave
may be better directed or even to determine  if  the  injuries  are  within
the abilities of the channeler to Heal.  After emoting the delve weave,  it
is a good idea to discuss the injury with the patient OOCly  through  tell,
or some other  channel,  and  negotiate  the  success  or  failure  of  the
subsequent Healing weave.  
&amp;c
Joe places his hands on Bob's head and spins out fine flows  of  Spirit  to
probe  through  his  body  to  determine  the  exent   of   his   injuries.
&amp;n
Healing works slightly differently for men than for  women.   According  to
Damer Flinn, Asha'man Healing hurts compared to the Healing the  Aes  Sedai
use.  Some other differences in the sensation is that instead of a wave  of
cold passing through the patient's body, it is a wave  of  heat.   This  is
not a pleasant warmth, but enough heat to be  very  uncomfortable  or  even
slightly painful.

Aes Sedai are rarely seen to sweat.   It  takes  great  stress  to  disturb
their concentration enough to cause them to lose  control  to  that  point.
They also do not seem to be touched by the cold.   Taim  and  the  Asha'man
also have this ability.  It is also one of the few things the  Chosen  have
shared with us. It is not a thing of the power, simply a trick of the mind.
Exactly how this is done is never explained, but that matters little.   One
doesn't need to know how to do it, just how to emote it.  A  sample  emote:
&amp;c
Jane turns her cool gaze on  the  minion  who  is  sweating  and  nervously
shifting his weight from one foot to the other.  She arches an  eyebrow  at
him, her own face dry, the heat seemingly not affecting her.   Imperiously,
she   asks,&quot;Is   there   any   particular   reason   you   are    nervous?&quot;
&amp;n
It is just a little something that can be  mentioned  in  your  RP  to  add
atmosphere or mystery.  It is something  that  requires  concentration  and
becomes easier with practice.  To one new to it, stress can  cause  one  to
lose the necessary concentration to maintain it.  After a few years of use,
it becomes so second nature that being terrified out of one's wits  is  not
enough to disrupt the ability.

KNOTS
&amp;n
Knotting:
Knotting or tying a weave is a method  whereby  a  weave  can  be  left  in
existance without the need for the weaver to maintain it.  The  name  comes
from the fact that the threads of the One  Power  used  in  the  weave  are
tied into knots so the structure will support itself.  In most  cases,  the
knots are rather simple, although it is  possible  to  tie  more  elaborate
knots to prevent someone else from untying to weave or  at  least  to  make
it more difficult for them.  In roleplay, this is very simple.  You just do
it. A couple of examples: 
&amp;c
Jane channels flows of Air, spinning them  into  a  tighly  spun  plate  to
form a hard barrier  to  shelter  the  small  alcove  from  random  arrows.
Deftly she ties the weave off and turns to concentrate on the  wounded  man
huddling beside her. 
&amp;c
Jane smiles grimly as the shield of Spirit slides  into  place,  separating
the Accepted from  the  True  Source.   Her  smile  turns  to  a  frown  of
concentration as she ties the weave in an elaborate knot.  As she  releases
Saidar, she turns to the other student and says,&quot;Practice  untying  weaves.
That  shield  should  keep  you  busy  and  out  of  trouble  for   hours.&quot;
&amp;n
Unknotting:
This consists of using flows of Spirit to knock  or  pick  apart  the  knot
holding a weave in place.  One method is to use the fine thread  of  Spirit
to untie  the  knot,  or  pick  it  apart  much  like  one  would  use  his
fingernails on a knot in a piece of string.  Another method is to insert  a
thin thread of Spirit inside the knot and &quot;flex&quot; it, shattering  the  knot.
The second method only  works  on  simple  knots.   A  complex  knot  would
require slowly and carefully untying it.  It should be noted that  one  can
only untie weaves she can see.  A woman would be unable to unknot  a  weave
made of Saidin, or one made  by  a  man  and  a  woman  linked.   Examples:
&amp;c
Jane examines the knotted weave for a moment, then  embraces  Saidar.   She
spins out a very fine thread of Spirit and slowly worms it inside the  knot
.  Once it is fully inside, she  pulses  more  strength  into  the  thread,
expanding it as if flexing a muscle hard.  The knot shatters and the  weave
it held unravels. 
&amp;c
Jane channels, snaking out a fine thread of Spirit and uses  it  to  slowly
pick apart the knot on the Airwall weave.  As she finally  works  the  knot
apart, she steps back and folds her hands together at  her  waist,  smiling
serenely as she watches the weave dissipate. 
&amp;n
Female channeling was used in the example, but the principle  is  the  same
for male, as well.

&amp;n
Whereas women that channel can sense the ability  in  other  women,  a  man
can only sense the ability in another man if that man is  actually  holding
the power.  It takes a test to determine whether  or  not  a  man  has  the
ability to channel and this test requires his cooperation.  This test  will
be outlined below.  Additionally, female channelers will see a glow  around
another woman that is holding the Power.  Men are not surrounded by a  glow
when they channel.  Other  male  channelers  will  &quot;feel&quot;  when  a  man  is
holding the power, but they will not see it, although  they  will  see  his
weaves when he channels.   Another  difference  is  that  women  can  judge
another woman's relative strength in the Power just by being near  her.   A
male channeler can tell only how much of the power another man is  holding.
A man can only tell another man's full capacity for the One Power  if  that
other man is holding his full capacity.
&amp;n
Test - A man channels a small flame and suspends it  above  his  palm.   He
has the subject concentrate on the  flame  for  several  moments  while  he
&quot;listens.&quot; If the subject can channel,  the  tester  will  sense  something
akin to an echo of his  own  channeling.   This  echo  will  feel  slightly
different if the subject is sparked than if he  can  just  be  taught.   An
example:
&amp;c
Joe holds out his hand and channels, causing a small flame  to  dance  over
his open palm.  He instructs Bob to  concentrate  on  the  flame  and  then
cocks his head slightly as  if  listening  for  something.   After  several
moments, he nods slightly and lets the flame wink out.   He  slowly  lowers
his hand to his side and says with an evil  gleam  in  his  eye,  &quot;You  can
channel. You will be useful after all.&quot;
&amp;n
The flame does not have to be over the hand.  It could be suspended in  mid
air or over a table or whatnot.  Over the palm is just how most are  taught
the  weave  and  people  tend  to  channel  the  way   they   are   taught.

Trollocs:
About 8-10 feet tall, these creatures combine elements of man  and  animal.
They have the heads of various types of animals and birds,  and  some  have
hoofed feet as well.  They use crude weapons, are very  strong,  harsh  and
cruel.  They are generally both stupid and cowardly,  and  usually  need  a
smarter and stronger leader to keep  them  in  line  and  force  them  into
action. Trollocs are the standard footsoldiers in the armies of the Shadow.
They are more herded than lead.  They obey out of fear,  not  loyalty.   Do
not show weakness in front of them.   Doing  so  can  lead  to  becoming  a
trolloc snack.  A person of Dreadlord rank can always  command  a  handfull
of trollocs at his own discretion when in the Camp.   For  use  outside  of
camp, GL permission would be required.  A Captain may command  trollocs  at
his own discretion, within or without the camp.

Myrddraal:
Known by many names, all Fades look the same.  They  are  taller  than  the
average man, with pasty white skin and no eyes.  They dress all  in  black.
Their clothing does not move in the wind.  They can feel  use  of  the  One
Power.  Their main weapon  is  a  black  sword  that  has  been  forged  in
Thakandar.  Wounds from these blades do not  heal  properly.   Without  the
help of a talented Healer the wounded certainly die.   Myrddraal  are  much
smarter  than  trollocs,  incredible  swordsmen  and  extremely  agile  and
durable.  They will not cross running  water  by  choice.   Fades  have  no
reflection other than a misty form.  Their gaze causes physical fear  in  a
person.  They often link with their patrol of Trollocs and  use  that  link
to direct and force them into action.  If a Fade is killed, this will  kill
or disable all the trollocs linked to that  fade.   A  Fade  will  not  die
instantly and can thrash for hours after  it's  death.   They  do  not  die
completely until the setting of the sun.  It is said that even Aginor  does
not understand their ability to travel by fading into and out  of  shadows.
Because of  their  ability  to  link  with  trollocs,  and  the  fear  that
trollocs hold for them, myrddraal make very good sergeants  or  lieutenants
for a Dreadlord.  Use them to herd your trollocs and you free  yourself  up
to consider strategy and to use your channeling directly against the enemy.
A Captain can command single Fades in camp at his own  discretion  and  use
them in a limited capacity outside camp on his own judgement.   Any  larger
scale use requires GL consent.
&amp;n
Draghkar:
These large winged, flying creatures are frequently used as  assassins  and
scouts for the Dark.  They are not very intelligent and do not fight  well.
Their main attack is to use a song  that  entices  their  victims  to  come
closer as if in a daze.  Once the victim is in range,  the  Draghkar  gives

them a kiss. This kiss drains the soul and then life. Those who have been
rescued once the kiss has  begun  would  have  been  better  off  dead.   A
Captain  may  use  a  Draghkar  for  high  altitude  scouting  on  his  own
initiative, although it should be rare. For lower ranks or for other uses,
GL consent is required.

Darkhounds:
These hounds are as large as ponies and frequently used to  track  specific
victims.  They have the usual abilities of dogs, and  can  be  confused  by
some of the same tricks such as crossing water.  They travel in packs of  8
to 10, and are the source of legends of the Wild Hunt.  Their paws  do  not
leave prints in dirt or mud although they can melt  pawprints  into  stone.
There is a scent of  sulfur  about  them  which  can  alert  one  to  their
presence.  Their saliva is an immensly corrosive and powerful  poison.   In
times of all out war, they make great shock troops.   As  we  have  yet  to
reach that state, GL  consent  is  required  for  any  use  of  Darkhounds.
&amp;n
Grey Men:
Once human, these assassins  gave  up  their  souls  to  the  Dark  One  in
exchange for the ability to pass unnoticed by even the most  alert  guards.
Their appearance is so ordinary  that  the  mind  simply  doesn't  register
their presence, but once discovered they can be killed in the same  way  as
any other shadowspawn. GL consent required.

THEORY
&amp;n
The  purpose  of  this  presentation  is  to  supply  the  student  with  a
knowledge of how the different flows react with  each  other  so  that  the
channeler may more easily determine which  flows  to  use  in  each  weave.
Since Robert Jordan was not consulted  in  this  matter,  it  is  all  just
opinion and speculation.  Hopefully, it  will  be  usefull  to  our  guild.
&amp;n
Each of the five flows has attributes which determine how  it  reacts  with
the other flows.  Aptitude with Fire and Earth is more common  in  men,  so
we will refer to these flows as masculine.  In general, the  use  of  Water
and Air come more easily to women.  We will label these as feminine.   Fire
and Air are more energetic flows, so will be referred to as active.   Water
and Earth embody  the  passive  principle.   Spirit  is  not  masculine  or
feminine.  It also  seems  to  function  in  an  active  or  passive  role,
depending on what is needed. 
&amp;n
Fire (masculine/active) 
Fire is used to control heat energy, adding or removing it  from  a  weave.
Care should be taken when  using  Fire  to  remove  heat,  as  drawing  the
energy into one's self is dangerous and very often fatal.  It  reacts  with
other flows as follows: 
&amp;n
Air -- These two flows  tend  to  compliment  and  strengthen  each  other.
Adding the two actives tends to make them  even  more  active.   The  male/
female aspects support each other.  To burn strongly, a fire  needs  plenty
of air. 
Earth -- The tension and conflict  caused  by  both  being  male,  but  one
active and one passive, can cause explosive reactions  if  twined  closely.
Water -- These two flows are diametrically opposite.   Combining  them  can
result in violent, energetic reactions. 
Spirit  --  Combination  with   spirit   can   produce   various   effects.
&amp;n
Air (feminine/active) 
Controls wind movements and can be used to  manipulate  objects  as  if  an
extra appendage.  Where  fire  is  heat  energy,  Air  is  kinetic  energy.
Interactions: 
&amp;n
Fire   --   Already    dealt    with    under    the    fire    discussion.
Earth -- These are complete opposites, like fire  and  water.   They  react
vigorously, although not as violently as would fire and water  because  the
active principle in this reaction is feminine. 
Water -- Both are feminine, which can cause conflict.   However,  they  can
also support one another.  The  passive  nature  of  water  can  provide  a
foundation  for   strengthening   the   actions   of   the   air   element.
Spirit  --  As  always,  combination  with  spirit  can  produce  different
results depending on how it is used. 
&amp;n
Earth (masculine/passive) 
Earth  is  used  for  manipulating  solids.   It  is  passive,  forming   a
foundation for other flows to  build  upon  or  react  with.   It  controls
cohesion, being used to reinforce and strengthen or to weaken and  crumble.
&amp;n
Fire -- Dealt with in the fire discussion. 
Air -- Dealt with in the air discussion. 
Water -- These flows are complimentary, much as fire and air are.   One  is
masculine and the other feminine, causing them to  mesh  well,  while  they
are both passive which causes no conflicts. 
Spirit -- Various results. 
&amp;n
Water (feminine/passive) 
Much like earth, water controls  cohesion,  providing  or  undermining  the
structure of a weave.  Because of the feminine nature, it  is  more  likely
to provide support than to be used  destructively.   It  is  also  used  to
manipulate liquids. 
The way water reacts with the other flows has  already  been  addressed  in
the sections for those various flows, with the exception of  Spirit,  which
reacts in various different ways depending on how it is used  and  what  is
needed. 
&amp;n
Spirit 
Spirit is neither masculine nor  feminine.   It  can  active  passively  or
actively or even neutrally.  It can act  as  a  catalyst  to  increase  the
effects of other flows, or it can dampen them.  Its realm  is  life  energy
and things dealing with the one power itself.

TRAPWARDS
&amp;n
&amp;CContinued from WARDS
&amp;n
&amp;c
Ivor looks down the hallway, first one way and then  the  other.   Finally,
he shakes his head and seizes Saidin.  Immediately,  he  begins  weaving  a
conical shell of Air and Spirit around himself and the Initiate.   The  air
shimmers around them briefly before Ivor says, &quot;Sometimes  even  the  walls
have ears, but it will not do them any good today.&quot;
&amp;n
Trap Wards
A trap ward is a framework of Spirit holding some other weave that  is  set
to release when a certain condition is met.  Two examples  from  the  books
are the ward Siune Sanche had on her letter box when she  was  Amyrlin  and
the prank that Siuane and Moiraine played on one  of  their  teachers  when
they were students in the Tower where they rigged a ball of water  to  drop
on the Sister's head when she entered her apartment.  This  is  likely  the
most complex type of warding.  Exactly how  it  is  set  up  depends  on  a
variety of things.  What triggers it?  What happens when it  is  triggered?
The way the weave is formed depends upon these answers.  In  a  case  of  a
box or door opening being the trigger, it  is  likely  that  the  weave  is
done in three parts.  In the example of the box, inside the  box  would  be
the framework of Spirit that holds the Fire weave.  The second part is  the
Fire weave itself.  The third part would be a weave of Spirit  attached  to
the lid such than when the lid  opens,  the  two  weaves  of  Spirit  cease
touching each other, which releases the Fire weave to do it's set function.
The same principle would apply to the trap on the doorway.   A  ward  could
also be set up to release a weave when a person passed through the warding.
This would require a detection ward to sense the  presense  of  the  person
and then the framework of Spirit to hold the &quot;trap&quot; weave.   For  the  most
part these wards are ineffective against  channelers  of  the  same  gender
unless they are low power weaves and are attached to the other side  of  an
opaque surface such as the lid of a box or the back of a door.   Otherwise,
they would be seen and easily avoided. 
&amp;c
Jane carefully refolds the letter and drops it into the ornate ivory  case.
Embracing, she quickly weaves a small web of  Spirit  into  the  bottom  of
the box.  Holding that weave, she channels threads of Fire, as  well,  into
a construct designed to incinerate the the papers in  the  case,  but  with
the web of Spirit carefully interposed  to  prevent  the  fire  weave  from
completing.  She ties both weaves off deftly, leaving a loose  end  on  the
Spirit weave in a slip knot pattern, such that if she  tugged  on  it,  the
entire thing would unravel.  She fixes a simple thread  of  Spirit  to  the
inside of the lid and gently  lowers  it,  attaching  that  thread  to  the
loose end just before the lid closes.

      <description>&amp;g
TRAVELLING
&amp;n
This weave is performed slightly differently for women than for  men.   For
men, pure Spirit is channeled into  a  spear-like  construct  and  used  to
punch a hole in the Pattern, leading from  one  place  to  another.   Women
weave a complex screen of Spirit.  This intricate weave of spirit  is  used
to form a similarity.   Basically,  the  spot  occupied  by  the  weave  is
altered to make it more and more similar to the destination one  is  trying
to reach until they -are- the same spot, at which point, the  gateway  will
open.
&amp;n
One must know the place from which he or she is leaving before  being  able
to Travel  to  another  place  unless  the  destination  is  such  a  short
distance that it can be seen.  It generally takes a few hours  to  learn  a
place well enough to Travel from it, although  this  varies  slightly  from
person to person.  The time can be greatly lessened, approximately  halved,
if   the   One   Power   is   held   the    entire    time    one    waits.
&amp;n
This is not a simple weave.  It requires a good deal  of  strength  in  the
One Power and is an exertion.  Only about ten percent of female  channelers
have the  necessary  strength.   Since  the  weak  do  not  usually  become
Dreadlords, most of our members will be able to perform the weave.   It  is
still not something easily done while fatigued, even for  the  stronger  of
the male Dreadlords.
&amp;n
The edges of the gateway are  incredibly  sharp,  able  to  apparently  cut
through anything.  A room has been set aside for ICly gating into the camp.
If one were to gate into a high traffic area, his  superiors  would  likely
consider  it   purely   self   defense   to   kill   him   out   of   hand.
&amp;n
A gateway does not automatically close when the weaver steps  through.   It
stays open as long as he holds the weave, regardless which side he  is  on.
&amp;n
Some examples of the weave: 
&amp;c
Joe seizes Saidin and channels thick flows of Spirit  into  a  spear-shaped
weave which he seemingly stabs directly into the  pattern,  boring  a  hole
to his destination.  A vertical slash of light appears and  rapidly  widens
into a hole  in  the  air  through  which  can  be  seen  a  large  cavern.
&amp;c
Jane weaves threads of Spirit into a complex weave as she  concentrates  on
her destination.  Abruptly, a slash of light  appears  and  rapidly  widens
into a sharp-edged hole in the air  through  which  can  be  seen  a  quiet
forest glade. 
&amp;n
While RPing the lesson, the instructor should teach the student  the  weave
in code, as well.  This may require  notifying  the  Imm  GL  to  have  the
proper special skill flag set on the student.

WARDS
&amp;n
Wards are weaves used to keep things out or warn of their  presense.   They
can also be used as traps.  The three main types of ward covered  here  are
detection, barrier and trap. 
&amp;n
Detection Wards:
The construction of a detection ward is dependent on what types  of  things
are being detected.  If one is setting  up  a  ward  to  warn  when  living
things contact it, then the weave will be made  of  pure  Spirit.   If  one
wanted to make an elaborate ward that would alert her to  the  presense  of
armored soldiers, Spirit would still be required for the framework  of  the
weave and to detect the person, but Earth would also be  required  to  pick
up the presense of the metal.   It  is  possible  to  refine  the  lifeform
detection and narrow it down.  Wards can be made to warn of Shadowspawn  or
humans.  For a woman, use of Saidar should be detectable, as well.   It  is
theoretically possible to narrow it down to being able to  set  up  a  ward
to warn if a woman capable of channeling approaches.  A man should be  able
to set up a ward to detect male channeling and channelers.  It may even  be
possible for either to  set  up  a  ward  to  detect  the  opposite  gender
channeling, but if so, that is likely lost  knowledge.   In  fact,  all  of
this is just theory and guesswork since Robert  Jordan  does  not  go  into
much   detail   or   description   when   his   characters   weave   wards.
&amp;c
Jane concentrates and spins out thin threads of Spirit in  a  complex  web,
straining to extend it to  cover  the  entire  campsite,  perhaps  an  area
thiry feet in radius.  As she ties off the weave and releases  Saidar,  she
says with fatigue evident in her voice, &quot;We will be warned  now  if  anyone
attempts to surprise us in our sleep.&quot; 
&amp;n
Barrier Wards:
This is almost  the  opposite  of  a  detection  ward.   Instead  of  being
receptive to the presense of a certain creature or material,  the  polarity
of the weave is reversed, causing it to repulse such things.  For the  most
part, this is only useful for dealing with vermin.  Aes Sedai commonly  use
it to keep rats and such out of any dwelling they  may  occupy.   It  would
require a great deal of power to repulse anything larger.   Basically  this
particular weave just generates an unpleasant  sensation  that  causes  the
rats to avoid the warded area.  An intelligent creature, such  as  a  Fade,
would be able to persevere through the discomfort unless the weave  was  of
sufficient magnitude to kill, in which case the Fade would  sense  it  from
a goodly distance, rendering  the  ward  more  of  a  large  glowing  arrow
pointing out the weaver than an actual useful  defensive  weave.   As  with
the detection ward, a barrier ward that keeps out living  things  would  be
composed of Spirit.  Theoretically, it should be possible to create a  ward
that would repulse non-living objects as well, such as arrows. In practice,
this would be next to impossible or at least so  difficult  as  to  make  a
simple shield of Air a much more feasible option.   One  practical  example
of  a  ward  that  repulses  non-living  things  is  the  barrier   against
eavesdropping. Examples: 
&amp;c
Jane's eyes narrow in concentration as she weaves threads  of  Spirit  into
a grid pattern which grows to cover the ground level  of  the  entire  Inn.
Her nose wrinkles  slightly  in  further  concentration  as  she  carefully
tunes the vibrations of the weave.  After several long moments, she  smiles
in satisfaction and ties the weave off.  Turning to the tavern keeper,  she
says  softly,  &quot;Thank  you  for  your  assistance,  Master   Brill.    Your
establishment shall be troubled by vermin no more.&quot;
