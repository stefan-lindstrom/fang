      <description>Blown into heaps and laid out flat in other places, one thing this forest does
not lack is leaves.  Huge piles of slowly decomposing leaf litter turn the soil
underfoot into rich, thick, fertile loam - trees thrive on the mixture, growing
tall around.  The piles of leaves themselves are of every shape, colour and

      <description>Foregate

Before the Shaido came, a secondary city lay outside the walls. Known as Foregate, this warren of gimcrack wood buildings and zigzag mud streets began as separate market villages for each of the city's gates, but over the years had grown into one vast hodgepodge of ramshackle buildings. After the Aiel War, when the refugee farmers from the east settled in Foregate, the then King Galldrian provided grain to feed them and all manner of parades and festivals to keep them from thoughts of uprising. As a result Foregate was a place of riotous colour, with foreworks supplied by the Illuminators' Guild many nights, horse races by the river, gleemen and musicians in every tavern and on ever street corner, and abject poverty underlying everything.

When the Shaido attacked Cairhien, Foregate burned like tinder, nearly taking the city with it. Many outlying towns and cities were lost as well. Tain, a town on the Aiel side of the Jangai Pass, a remnant of the time the Silk Path was in use, had survived the Aiel War and the closing of the path, but fell to the Shaido. Selean, a similar, though larger, town on the Cairhien side of the pass, suffered the same fate. The few farmers in the area who had not fled to the capital also perished or were taken prisoner. There is no doubt that the Shaido would have destroyed the entire nation had Cairhien not received aid to stop them. If the Cairhienin have learned nothing else, they have learned that their Great Game is a useless weapon against the Aiel.

Cairhienin Dress Code

Cairhienin upper-class dress reflects their desire for control and order. The pepole are shorter and more pale-skinned than Andorans, though with darker hair, and the dark colours they prefer contrast with their fair skin. Men and women wear coats and dresses of black or dark blue or green. The darkness is relieved by narrow horizontal slashes of colour across the chest and body, and dark ivory lace at the throat and wrists. The number of colour slashes indicates the rank of the wearer, while their colour indicates the House. A very high ranking lord or lady might have slashes of colour from collar to hem, while a lower ranked noble might only have a few slashes across the chest.

The ladies wear their hair tightly coiffed into elaborate towers of curls carefully designed as unique to the wearer. The men wear their hair long, with flat or bell-shaped velvet caps. Formal wear is much the same, equally dark, save that ladies' skirts are extremely wide and supported by hoops, and the materials used are finer. Even the liveried servants only have colour in a few stripes on the cuffs and their hous badge emrboidered on the breast of coat or dress. Some liveries have house colours covering the collar or sleeves, but rarely the entire coat or dress. Upper servants show more colour on their livery than lower attendants.

The lower classes are comparatively free from the restraints of the Great Game, and they are free to dress any way they wish. They often approach the extremes of flamboyance that their betters avoid. Their clothes may be ill-fitting and shabby, but they are extremely colourful. Bright skirts and shirts with coats and shawls of equally bright, though often clashing, colours are quite common.

Military dress follows the same dark colours as the nobles, but with a few embellishments. Officers wear slashes of rank across their coats much as nobles do, but they shave the front of th ehead and often dust it with white powder, leavin gthe hair hanging long in back. High-ranking officers wear ornately gilded cuirasses as well as large white plumes attached to their bell-shaped helmets and ornate gauntlets. Lesser officers and soldiers wear much plainer armour. Regular soldiers wear their hair cut short in a basic bowl cut. Until the Shaido War, the nobles who commanded the soldiers did not shave their heads, leaving that to the common-born, but after it many nobles who had 'seen the wolf' - as Cairhienin say of those who have seen action - took up the practice.

      <description>In direct contrast to the convoluted maneuvering of their Great Game, the upper merchant classes prefer complete control and perfect order in their environment. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the capital city of Cairhien. It was built on the site of the ancient city of Al'cair'rahienallen, Hill of the Golden Dawn, but only the sunrise on the banners remains, and only the Ogier remember what it stood for. Al'cair'rahienallen had a great Ogier grove just beyond its boundaries, but the grove was not tended after the Trolloc Wars, the Great Trees are gone, and there remains only a forest where firewood is cut.

The modern city is laid out in a precise grid pattern within the perfect suqare formed by the high gray perimeter walls. The River Alguenya flows along one side of the city, yet the uncompromising perfection of the wall mocks the flowing curves of hills and river. Perhpas the Cairhienin architects wishe to force nature to bend to their rigid control. The high walls are broken only by several well-guarded square gates. Within the walls, the famous Topless Towers of Cairhien stand in exact patterns, covered with scaffolding up to their jagged unfinished tops. Before the Aiel War, these towers were renowned as a wonder of the world, reaching almost to the clouds, it was said, but during the Aiel War they burned and fell. They were damanged again during the Shaido War.

Throughout the city wide paved streets run arrow-straight, despite any curves in the underlying terrain, meeting every crossing street at perfect right angles. Closed sedan chairs or curtained carriages travel the city among the pedestrians ostentatiously minding their own business. All the buildings and terraces are made of stone, decorated only with straight lines and sharp angles. The hills are so carved and terraced into striaght lines that they look man-made.

Most of the structures have sustained some of the damage from the wars, except for the imposing bulk of the Royal Library of Cairhien. The Aiel spared it deliberately, refusing to damage or destroy any book. Within the walls lies one of the greatest repositories of knowledge in the world, second only to that of Tar Vaoln. Though most Cairhienin do not know it, the Royal Library is probably the greatest treasure of their nation.

In recent times, under the regency, Cairhien has been enhanced by the formation of a school in the late Lord Barthanes' old manor to give inventors, philosophers, and those interested in science and thought a place to work. Some amazing works have been produced there.

The Sun Palace

At the exact centre of the city, on the highest hill, stands the massive square bulk of the Sun Palace of Cairhien, crowned with steppd towers precisely placed in concentric squares of increasing height. Tall narrow windows and lofty colonnaded walks enhance its stern command. Within its walls are many gardens, but even the plants, flowers and trees are precisely pruned and strictly ordered into perfect square or rectangular beds.

Within the heart of th epalace is the Grand Hall of the Sun, a great throne room with massive square columns of blue-streaked marble and a large golden mosaic Rising Sun set into the deep blue tiles of the floor. At the far end of the Hall, upon a white dais, rests the soul of the palace, the Sun Throne. A model of Cairhienin restraint, the heavy armchair has simple straight lines despite the golden silk and gilding on the wood. The only curves are in the wavy-rayed golden sun set high on the throne's back, so made as to shine above the head of its occupant.

Even the artifacts and artwork displayed through the dark, heavy corridors of the Palace are chosen for their straight lines and sharp edges. Tapestries contain the only large concentrations of colour, but even there the Cairheinin need for control is demonstrated through the rigid, tightly controlled groupings of the subjects depicted.

      <description>Robyn's Wonderful Guide to Calculating Dice Averages

Right. Find your desired average roll (From now on called AVG) (consult the OLC guide and balance rules if you aren't sure what this should be). Select a number (preferably, this should divide into AVG without a remainder) - this will be your number of dice, so for HP dice make it under 30 (From now on, this number will be called DNO). Divide AVG by DNO.

Multiply your answer by 2.
Take away 1.
This is the size of 1 die - that is, the number of faces each die should have.

Example:

I want a desired average roll of 1800, as an HP roll for a mob. Let DNO be 20 (An arbitrary decision - I could have chosen 10, or 18, or whatever).

1800/20 = 90
90 * 2  = 180
180 - 1 = 179
So, I have 20 dice (DNO), each of size 179. This will give me an average roll of 1800.

Please don't ask me to explain how this works. I keep losing track of it myself - but it _does_ work, I promise.

(This object came, along with the shrubbery, both the harps, all the -strange- doors, and the ribbit/redit/medit frog, out of Robyn's twisted imagination and lack of coffee. At the time of writing, she has not had any coffee for three weeks. This officially classes her as a Good Person, or maybe a Flaming Lunatic.)

      <description>A beautiful instrument, it stands a few inches below six feet tall.  The
curving lines of the wooden soundboard, the polished \c10golden\c00 gleam of the pedal
mechanism, the shining rows of strings, all speak of care and attention.  The
left side of the \c10h\c03a\c10r\c03p\c00 appears to be the side most commonly seen by an audience,
since the strings are set slightly to that side, and the \c08S\c01a\c03l\c10v\c09i\c00 logo is
emblazoned on that side.  The bulky tuning pegs are concealed on the other side
of the harp.  A well-used leather pocket attached to the front of the harp
holds a tuning key, just in front of the stool.  Most of the strings appear to
be in very good repair, except, strangely, for one C at the very top; it
appears almost constantly on the verge of snapping, with frayed material around
it.  The stool next to the \c10h\c03a\c10r\c03p\c00 is rather battered, but obviously has
generations of harpists behind it.
