preparing a paper on a past Amyrlin to whatever you can think of
to try and get approval for.  This doesn&apos;t have to be a major
project, if you just want to write up something and mail it in,
that is your choice.  This is an opportunity to RP with other
members of the Tower doing something other than just lessons and 
lectures. Curious about the Old Tongue? Talk to a few brown about 
a research project in the library. Want to know more about Healing? 
Talk to a yellow or two and see if they can help you with a project 
of sorts. You get the idea.

Once a Novice has completed a certain set of Lectures, her name will
be changed to &amp;Rred&amp;n and capitalized on the update. This means she
needs to talk to the GL and get her updated background in so that the
novice&apos;s Test can be designed.  The night of the test, she will receive
her final lecture and interview with the Mistress of Novices. The lecture
portion will detail the test and what the novice should expect, the 
interview will decide if the novice is ready.  Should the novice be 
deemed ready, then she will continue on with the Test itself.  If she is
deemed unready or unsuited for the test, then another date will be set
or arrangements for the novice to leave the Tower will be made.

      <description>The Nature of the Seals on the Dark One&apos;s Prison

A Theory by Siomaydra Demieynn
        During the course of my studies, I came across several entries in
books mentioning the seals that seal the Dark One within his prison.  As most
know, the seals were used as focal points to reseal the Dark One in prison,
along with the Forsaken, by Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page2">
      <description>The Dark One&apos;s counterstroke caused the taint on Saidin, and led to every
male Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends going mad, beginning the Time of Madness
and the Breaking of the World.  However, in all of the mentionings made by
various scholars concerning the seals, none ever intimated how they worked,
or more definitively, the nature of what makes them work, or indeed the
very nature of the seals themselves.  It is here, in these pages, that I will
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page3">
      <description>propose various theories concerning the nature of the seals, the nature of
what makes them work, and how they work.
        It is well known - or should be - that the seals are made of 
cuendillar, a substance made with the One Power that is unbreakable.  The 
making of cuendillar is of course lost to us, along with so much else, but
is our understanding of cuendillar?  By this, I mean, how much do we honestly
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page4">
      <description>know of the substance, apart from that it was made through the One Power, is
unbreakable, and is very rare in today&apos;s society?  Perhaps it is in our
understanding of the very nature of cuendillar which lies our key to learning
of the nature of the seals.  Thus, I have endeavoured to study cuendillar, 
the findings of which follow:
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page5">
      <description>        1.  It is made through the One Power.
        2.  It is unbreakable.
        3.  Attempts to break cuendillar only seem to make it stronger, though
            that comment in itself is slightly incorrect given the statement
            of point 2.  Something already unbreakable should not be made
            stronger, or even weaker, but should logically remain the same,
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page6">
      <description>            or at least bear no change.
        4.  Cuendillar was shapeable, somehow, during the Age of Legends,
            since there are many artifacts surviving today which bear various
            shapes.
        Given the above points, I draw the reader&apos;s attention to point 4.  If
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page7">
      <description>cuendillar was indeed shapeable, how was such shapeing achieved?  The obvious
answer is through the One Power.  However, such attempts made by myself proved
unsuccessful.  This simply could be a lack of knowledge, of course, but I
have another theory.  Perhaps cuendillar was not actually made and then
shaped.  Perhaps, instead, objects were made, and then formed into cuendillar.
This would seem far more logical, given the variety of objects of cuendillar
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page8">
      <description>that exist today.  Perhaps, through the One Power, normal everyday ores and
materials can be &apos;cuendillarised&apos;, a term I will use to represent this belief.
        Now, considering this, it is probable that the seals, when
cuendillarised, were done so imperfectly, which would explain their weakening
in recent times.  However, this raises the question of why other cuendillar
objects also do not weaken.  Surely imperfect cuendillarisation could not
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page9">
      <description>simply be a once off occurrence?  Perhaps it was!
        Consider some key things we know of the Age of Legends: the greatest 
feats of the One Power were accomplished by men and women working together; 
the sealing of the Bore was accomplished by only male Aes Sedai.  Given these
two factors, we can logically assume that the female Aes Sedai of the time
were either a) not informed of the action that would be taken by the male Aes
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page10">
      <description>Sedai, in advance, and thus had no part in it, or b) the female Aes Sedai of
the time took no part in male Aes Sedai&apos;s strike because they did not
countenance it.  This would indicate that, based on my theory of 
cuendillarisation of common materials, the male Aes Sedai cuendillarised the
seals that would be used as focal points for the Dark One&apos;s prison alone,
without the aid of female Aes Sedai.  This seems to lend weight to the theory
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page11">
      <description>of imperfect cuendillarisation of the seals, as mentioned above.
        However, since we do not know how cuendillar was actually made, this
theory is simply that, a theory.  Perhaps if we knew more, we might be able
to work out the reason for why the seals weaken as they do.  If my theory
was correct, however, it may be that the cuendillarisation process was only
part way completed, and thus over time the seals have weakened due to lack of
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page12">
      <description>completion of the process.  This makes me wonder whether Aes Sedai of our time
could perhaps complete the cuendillarisation process, and thus strengthen the
seals on the Dark One&apos;s prison.  Perhaps this will be rediscovered before 
Tarmon Gai&apos;don.  I believe, though, that the seals will play a large part in
the Dark One&apos;s resealment into his prison, regardless.  Perhaps knew seals
will be made, successfully.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page13">
      <description>        That is my theory on the nature of the seals themselves, as physical
entities, and one reason as to why they may be weakening.  However, what of
the question of the nature of how the seals work?
        Consider what we know of the seals already:
        1.  They are made of cuendillar.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page14">
      <description>        2.  They are unbreakable.
        3.  They are weakening.
        4.  They are the focal points that hold the Dark One within his
            prison, along with the Forsaken.
        5.  They were placed by male Aes Sedai.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page15">
      <description>        Logically, point 1 should not be the reason they work as they do.  If
that were so, simply because they are cuendillar, we would be able to use any
cuendillar artifacts we have as seals.  Points 2 and 3 conflict, and thus
will be glazed over in this part of the discussion; they bear no significance
in the nature of how the seals work.  This leaves points 4 and 5 as possible
answers to the nature of how the seals work.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page16">
      <description>        Point 4 is more a statement of the seals&apos; function, however, looking
deeper into this statement, it is a possibility that their function is part
of their nature.  Or, more succinctly, their function and nature are closely
linked.  Examine, for a moment, the purpose of the seals:  To keep the Dark
One and the Forsaken within the Bore, to seal it.  Could it be that the 
nature of the seals draws on their purpose?  To continue their purpose, 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page17">
      <description>perhaps the seals must draw on the evil that is the Dark One, and also his
minions, the Forsaken.  But then, why are the seals weakening?  
        I propose the belief that the Dark One is pure evil, the essence of 
evil.  Also, I propose that the Forsaken, although evil and deep in the 
Shadow, are not as evil as the Dark One, nor the essence of evil that the 
Dark One is.  Using this as the basis for my theory, consider the possibility
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page18">
      <description>that the Dark One has managed to use the non-evil (I hesitate to use &apos;good&apos;)
parts of the Forsaken as a buffer to the seals.  This answers the question of
both the nature of the seals - drawing on the evil of the Dark One to
maintain their purpose - and the question of why they are weakening - because
the Dark One perhaps has somehow managed to &apos;starve&apos; the seals of the evil
that keeps them continueing their purpose.  
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page19">
      <description>        This theory also draws on the information cited by many authors that 
the Forsaken were sealed after the Dark One was, sealed closer to the real 
world, and thereby the ever weakening seals.
        Another theory as to the nature of how the seals work is the belief
that the seals somehow draw on the One Power.  Entertaining this notion, I
can theorise that the taint on Saidin plays a large part into the reason of
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page20">
      <description>why the seals are weakening.  Point 5 above tells us that the seals were
placed by men only, which means Saidin was used.  Saidin which is tainted by
the Dark One&apos;s touch.  Saidin, which may provide the strength of the seals; 
and conversely, the taint of the Dark One.  If this is the case, then as time
goes by, with the seals drawing on the One Power to operate, they are also
suffering from a build up of the taint, just as a man who channels does.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page21">
      <description>        Consider this picture:  A man who channels eventually goes mad with
the taint, and suffers from a rotting sickness.  If, indeed, the seals draw
on Saidin to operate, could they not also suffer from a rotting sickness,
thereby causing them to weaken?  I think this is quite probable.  However, 
since it is unknown whether or not such a thing can be set up (an object
constantly drawing on the Power to operate), I must wonder if it is possible.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page22">
      <description>But, then, tied off flows perhaps could have been used, as they were to
guard Callandor all these years.  Though, of course, a Warding and an object
drawing on the Power are entirely different.
        Now, turning the direction of discussion to that of how the seals
work.  I have already discussed the nature of how the seals work, which is
similar to how the seals work, but, not entirely the same in my point of
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page23">
      <description>view.  How do the seals do what they do?  How do the seals maintain a closure
to the Dark One&apos;s prison?  Do they work similar to mortar between stones?  Or
do they work as a clasp on a gate?  Do the seals focus on the prison as some
kind of impervious sphere, a sphere which is the Dark One&apos;s prison?  All of
these questions remain largely unanswered.  However, I will try to answer 
them now, with my own theories.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page24">
      <description>        Taking into account what we already know of the seals, that they are
focal points on the Dark One&apos;s prison, I have to logically conclude that the
seals themselves are NOT his prison.  If the seals themselves were the Dark  
One&apos;s prison, it would seem probable that with the destruction of one, a way
would be open to the Dark One to destroy the rest of the prison.  This means 
that something else is his prison, and that the seals act similarly to a 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page25">
      <description>hinge or mortar; something that seems far more likely.  As the seals weaken,
so does the hinge, or the mortar, slowly rusting, or crumbling.
        Given this, it seems likely that other focal points could be made to
replace the rusting hinge, the crumbling mortar.  But do the current seals 
need to be destroyed entirely before this can happen?  I hope it is not so.
        Now that I have answered the questions I set out to answer, or at
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page26">
      <description>least provide some theory on, I must make clear that these theories are just
that.  From the study I have done, I feel confident in the theories I have
made within this discussion.  In some instance, I pray that I am wrong,
however; in others, I pray that I am right.  Drawing on logic to conclude
much of what I have presented has not necessarily always led to what we
wish to hear, or what we hope to be true.  
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page27">
      <description>        But based in logic can we hope to provide answers to questions which 
remain unanswered.  In logic, can we hope to find the truth of many of these
questions.  In hope.

      <description>An Overview to the Aes Sedai in Tar Valon

by Zherza Sedai
-----------------------------------------
Here at the White Tower in Tar Valon women are trained to Channel the One
Power. They are trained by fully-trained Channelers, who are called Aes 
Sedai. There were male Aes Sedai in the past, but now only women are 
trained to Channel.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page2">
      <description>Few people are born with the ability to learn to Channel, and even fewer 
with what is termed &apos;the spark&apos;.  Those who are born with the spark will 
Channel whether they wish to or not, though these women only have a one in
four chance of surviving, and those that do, usually form a block against
what they are doing. In both cases, the ability does not manifest itself 
until puberty. Those women with the ability to learn will never Channel
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page3">
      <description>unless they are trained at the White Tower. Born Channelers who survive 
the effects of coming into their ability untutored learn a rough control
over the One Power, but will never have the abilities of a full Aes Sedai
unless they are trained. We call such women &quot;Wilders&quot;.

      <description>Three thousand years ago, during the Age of Legends, male and female
Aes Sedai worked together to create many wonders with the One Power. But
the Dark One escaped from his prison in Shayol Ghul, creating a risk to all
of mankind. Once the Dark One was free of his prison, he subverted thirteen
of the most powerful channelers of the time, whom we now call the Forsaken.
The One Hundred Companions, a group of 100 male Aes Sedai, were able to

    <exdesc keyword="page5">
      <description>reseal the Dark One&apos;s prison, but as a result, saidin, the male half of 
the True Source, was tainted forever more, which led to the Breaking of
the World.

This taint is similar to an oil slick on water. The water - saidin -
is pure, but it can&apos;t be touched without touching the oil - the taint. The
taint caused all of the male Aes Sedai to die of a rotting disease like

    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page6">
      <description>leprosy, or go mad, using their abilities in deadly ways. The earthquakes
and lightning bolts they Channeled in their madness Broke the World, 
changing the entire known landscape and killing millions. That was the end
of the Age of Legends.

Since that time, there have been no trained male Aes Sedai. Those men
born with the ability to Channel still suffer from the effects of the taint
and go mad or die of the rotting disease. Those of the Red Ajah dedicate
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="page7">
      <description>themselves to hunting down these men and permanently cutting them off from
the Source, as their madness is a risk to all around them because of their 
ability to Channel.

Male Channelers are very rare, and considered horrors or dangers throughout
the world. Prophecies foretell that the Dragon Reborn will be a Channeler. 
The Dragon is destined to combat the Dark One at the Last Battle. (Although

Tower which shall return triumphant, and the Aes Sedai to whom the people
will owe their salvation).

    <exdesc keyword="page9">
      <description>Periodically, a man declares himself the Dragon Reborn, attracting
supporters.  Foes also rise up against him, and wars are often started in
this way. Not all of these False Dragons can Channel, but those who can are
captured by us and &quot;gentled&quot;, their ability to Channel permanently 
removed. This may sound cruel and harsh, but it must be realised we do 
this for the benefit of the world. The Breaking was a most terrible thing

      <description>and it was caused by male channelers going mad.  Hence, the only rational 
course open to us is to gentle these channelers, thus saving the lives of 
millions in the process.

After the Breaking of the World, people naturally became mistrusting of 
the One Power and its users, so even female Channelers are regarded with 
suspicion by most people and wrongly so.  We take the 3 Oaths and help

      <description>Several countries have laws against Channeling within their borders. In 
most places, when a woman manifests the ability to Channel, she is 
immediately sent to us here at the White Tower for training, regardless of
her position in life (and may I add that it is a blessing that people at
least see some wisdom).  Were channelers allowed to walk around freely 
without having been trained first, they would surely cause another

      <description>Daes Dae&apos;mar, the Game of Houses, is a national obsession. The
nobility jockey constantly for power and position, using commoners as
pawns or assassins. The commoners seek any information that might be

nobility of almost all southern nations, it is taken to extremes in
Cairhien.

      <description>Cairhien&apos;s culture is sharply divided along class lines. The upper
classes care little about the lower. Cairhienin display a formal

country&apos;s ruler is the head of the most powerful House, whether male

The Spine of the World mountain range forms Cairhien&apos;s eastern border,
and the nation is equidistant between the northern and southern
portions of the continent. The mountains of Kinslayer&apos;s Dagger border
Cairhien to the north.

Much of the country is hilly land, and the Cairhien terrace those
hills for building and farming purposes. Many noble houses support
vineyards on their terraced estates. The village Tremonsien grows
barley and oats.

      <description>&amp;cAccepted Test&amp;n

 
The following are examples of the types of questions that should 
be posed to the Accepted and the sorts of things she is expected 
to know and be able to do. The person giving the test should use 
her own discretion, as well, asking any additional questions she 
feels are necessary not only to test the student&apos;s ability, but to 
help improve that ability. 
 
 
Have the Accepted discuss the rules for Accepted and why each is important. 
 
Have the Accepted discuss which Ajah she wishes to join and 
both the character&apos;s IC reasons for choosing this Ajah as well as 
the player&apos;s OOC reasons. She should demonstrate a clear 
understanding of the Ajah&apos;s purpose. For example, answers that 
would indicate a lack of understanding: &amp;yI want to be green 
because I already have two warders lined up to bond. I want to 
be yellow because I want Heal Gentling.&amp;n Although these might 
be adequate OOC reasons -just barely-, they are somewhat 
lacking in IC justification. 
 
Have the Accepted discuss the bond and her view on the 
relationship between warders and Sedai, bearing in mind the 
particular Ajah she is choosing. 
 
Quiz the Accepted on the stereotypical views the guild has 
towards other guilds and how these vary or coincide with her own 
views. 
 
Have the Accepted discuss which of the Shadowspawn she 
considers most dangerous and why. 
 
Have the Accepted demonstrate forming a ward to keep out 
vermin. 
 
Ask the Accepted to discuss the advantages and disadvantages 
of linking. 
 
Have the Accepted discuss the Healing weave and her ability 
with it. 
 
Go through two or three rounds of sparring with weaves to check 
the Accepted&apos;s facility. Be wary of closed emotes and supersedai 
syndrome. 
 
Have the accepted demonstrate tying weaves and destroying 
knots. 
 
Ask the Accepted which areas she thinks she needs most needs 
to improve. 
 
&amp;RNote:&amp;n Most of these questions do not really have a specific -right- 
response. They are designed to ascertain if the Accepted is ready 
to play an Aes Sedai character on her own.

      <description>&amp;cCombat Emote Channeling&amp;n
 
Demonstrate to the student how to emote combat involving 
channeling. Eventually this document may be expanded into a 
more comprehensive guide. For now, it is just a sort of checklist 
of things the author feels should be addressed. Make sure that 
the student keeps the following concepts in mind: 
 
Keep the Oaths in mind.
 
Do not use closed emotes.
 
Always respond to your opponent&apos;s emote.
 
Tend towards wraps and shields whenever possible.
 
Keep in mind that combat weaves are fatiguing. Saidar is not as 
well suited to destructive weavings.
 
Enter combat as a last resort.
 
Keep your strengths and weaknesses in mind.
 
Emphasize defense instead of offense.
 
Be aware of your surroundings. Read the room description.
 
Use this lesson as an opportunity to instruct sliceweave.
 
Coordinate with your warder(s). They don&apos;t have that pesky third 
oath.

    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="bond">
      <description>&amp;cThe Bond&amp;n
 
Bonding is a fairly new thing, introduced around the time of the 
formation of the White Tower. The bond is formed of Spirit. Once 
bonded an Aes Sedai and her Gaidin are constantly aware each 
of the other&apos;s physical and emotional status. This doesn&apos;t mean 
that an Aes Sedai can read her gaidin&apos;s mind, or vice versa, 
simply that they can sense feelings such as worry, fear, pleasure, 
pain and even jealousy. This connection exists regardless of 
distance and is like a small, separate part within a person&apos;s mind 
that represents his or her bondmate. 
 
There are several advantages that warders gain through the 
bond. They heal faster than other people and can last longer 
without food, water or sleep. They share with their Aes Sedai the 
ability to sense the close presence of shadowspawn -not 
darkfriends, shadowspawn- and their dreams are shielded 
against those who can manipulate Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod. 
 
The advantages to an Aes Sedai are obvious in that she has 
somebody to protect her when she is unable to channel, 
channelling would be unsafe, or she is too weak or hurt. She is 
also able to draw strength from her Warder. 
 
Unfortunately, this bond means that when one bondmate dies the 
other feels a tremendous loss, also known as bondloss. Many 
Gaidin have been known to go insane or seek their own deaths 
after the loss of their Aes Sedai. Aes Sedai feel incredible loss, 
grief, and loneliness for a long period of time after the death of a 
Gaidin. 
 
Many Aes Sedai believe that distraction is the best way to get 
over bondloss, and will rebond a gaidin who has lost his Aes 
Sedai in an attempt to stop him from suicide. 
 
Jane spins out threads of Spirit woven into a complex web. As 
she reaches down and places her fingertips on the kneeling 
man&apos;s forehead, she sinks the weave into his skull, forming a 
permanent link between him and herself. 
 
There are OOC obligations that go along with the bond. A warder 
is a companion, a guard and a servant. They are not typically 
lovers. There is, of course, no hard and fast rule that works for all 
players. In general, however, it is a very good idea to have a long 
OOC discussion with a potential bondmate beforhand. Make 
certain that both parties are on the same page in their view of the 
bond and the relationship. Long observation has taught this 
author that bonds based on &quot;romantic&quot; relationships rarely last. 
Before bonding someone, make absolutely certain that he 
understands what you expect from a warder. It will save a lot of 
trouble and bond-passing in the long run. That is the reason for 
this being an actual taught lesson instead of just a reading. This 
way if someone has a series of bad bonds after completely 
ignoring this advice, we will know that we have at least tried. 
 
&amp;RNOTE:&amp;n The weave is not actually taught until very late in the 
student&apos;s education. Typically, it is saved until right before she is 
raised to the shawl. However, there have been several incidents 
of Accepted learning the weave by seeing it used. Therefore, it is 
included in the Accepted Syllabus. The IC repercussions of 
bonding while still Accepted are severe. Typically, punishment 
includes delaying the Accepted&apos;s promotion to the shawl for a 
lengthy period of time and forcefully transferring the bond to 
someone else.

    <exdesc keyword="novtest">
      <description>&amp;cNovice Test&amp;n
 
The following are examples of the types of questions that should 
be posed to the Novice and the sorts of things she is expected to 
know and be able to do. The person giving the test should use 
her own discretion, as well, asking any additional questions she 
feels are necessary not only to test the student&apos;s ability, but to 
help improve that ability. 
 
Have the Novice tell what the rules are for novices and the 
reasoning behind each of the rules. 
 
Have the novice demonstrate her ability to emote grasping the 
One Power, varying the amount she holds, and releasing. 
 
Quiz the Novice on her abilities in each of the five powers. Make 
certain that she has a firm understanding of her own IC strengths 
and weaknesses and that these things are plausible. 
 
Have the Novice perform some hypothetical task that can be 
done in more than one way to test her tendencies. For example, 
have her bend a thin piece of metal with the One Power. This 
could be done with Earth, or Air, or even Fire. There is no single 
answer that is always correct, as such. The importance of the 
question is to see if the student has a grasp not just of how the 
One Power works, but of her own limitations and strengths with it. 
 
Have the novice explain the pecking order among the Aes Sedai. 
Likely, this will just be a matter of her regurgitating the information 
in the hierarchy lecture, but serves the purpose of making sure 
that she does at least look at it. 
 
Ask a random question about the history of the White Tower, just 
to affirm that the Novice has read it. 
 
Explain why each of the three oaths is important and why they 
should be followed at all times. 
 
Have the Novice list some examples of when the hierarchy is not 
to be followed. -i.e. an Accepted given privileges sometimes held 
only by aes sedai, etc...who is able to give them the authority- 
 
Trick question: Ask the student to demonstrate her emote 
channeling ability by performing some impossible task. For 
example, ask her to demonstrate autolevitation -lifting herself into 
the air- or shapeshifting or some such. It does not matter what 
the task is, as long as it is something that would not be possible 
in the theme of the Wheel of Time world. One of the philosophies 
behind this syllabus is that good instruction is a better method of 
deterring &quot;unrealistic&quot; RP than some complex Talent Policy. 
Therefore, it is important that we never promote someone who 
believes that she can polevault herself through the air and land 
safely using the one power or other such unlikely things. 
 
Ask why the Novice wishes to be an Aes Sedai, both IC reasons 
for the character and OOC reasons for the player. 
 
&amp;RNOTE:&amp;n This should not be viewed simply as a test. It is also 
somewhat instructional. It should not be terribly unusual for 
someone to fail the first time, but they should walk away from the 
test knowing why they failed and what they should work on. It 
cannot be stressed enough that passing someone who does not 
really grasp the concepts is not &quot;being nice&quot; to them. If someone 
cannot adequately emote channel or play the role of an Accepted, 
she should not be raised. If she is passed without meeting the 
accepted standards and then demonstrates that lack in public it 
will not only make the guild as a whole look bad, but result in 
possible embarrassment and/or ridicule for the student. Aes 
Sedai should be respected (or feared), not laughed at behind 
their backs.

    <exdesc keyword="advanced2">
      <description>&amp;cPose:&amp;n
Pose is like an emote, except that it does not start with the 
character&apos;s name. It is useful for variety. It is important, however, 
that one always identify herself in the pose. Avoid things like: 
 
&amp;Cpose Nodding slowly, she smiles at the man. &amp;n
 
Make it clear who is doing the pose, such as: 
 
&amp;ypose Nodding slowly, Jane smiles at the man. &amp;n
 
 
&amp;cCemote:&amp;n
Cemote is a command for channeling emotes. Where pemote 
has two parts, cemote has three. The first part is an emote seen 
by other female channelers. The second is a pose seen by male 
channelers. The third is a pose seen by non-chans. In most 
situations this is way too slow and cumbersome to use in RP. 
Much like pemote, it is useful for dealing with people who have 
trouble keeping their IC and their OOC separated. An example 
would be a room with several women in it and one or more 
Asha&apos;man. One one embraces the one power. If the Asha&apos;man is 
played by a poor RPer, he will likely zero in on exactly the woman 
who embraced, even though all he could really tell would be that 
someone had embraced, not who. Cemote is ideal for these 
situations. Example: 
 
Jane&apos;s player types: 
&amp;Ccemote embraces Saidar, slowly being enveloped by the golden 
glow.|Your skin tingles slightly in that tell-tale indication that a 
woman is channeling nearby. &amp;n
 
Other female chans in the room would see: 
&amp;yJane embraces Saidar, slowly being enveloped by the golden 
glow. &amp;n
 
Male chans would see: 
&amp;yYour skin tingles slightly in that tell-tale indication that a woman is 
channeling nearby. &amp;n
 
Non-chans would see nothing, as the third part of the cemote was 
not added. ICly, they would notice nothing anyway. An example 
of a cemote that includes all three parts: 
 
&amp;Ccemote weaves flows of Air to stir up a light breeze in the plaza, 
blowing from east to west.|Your skin tingles to indicate a woman 
is channeling nearby as a light breeze springs up in the plaza, 
blowing from east to west.|A light breeze springs up in the plaza, 
blowing from east to west. &amp;n
 
Other female chans in the room would see: 
&amp;yJane weaves flows of Air to stir up a light breeze in the plaza, 
blowing from east to west. &amp;n
 
Male chans would see: 
&amp;yYour skin tingles to indicate a woman is channeling nearby as a 
light breeze springs up in the plaza, blowing from east to west. &amp;n
 
Non-chans would see: 
&amp;yA light breeze springs up in the plaza, blowing from east to west. &amp;n
 
&amp;cChanneling for Non-Chans:&amp;n
If no other chans are in the RP, there is little need for always 
describing the flows or the glow of Saidar. They can&apos;t see them 
anyway. It is important, however, to still avoid using closed 
emotes. An example: 
&amp;yJane frowns at Joe, her hands on her hips and her foot tapping 
impatiently. Suddenly the air shimmers around him as she 
attempts to wrap him with the One Power. &amp;n
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="advemote">
      <description>&amp;cAdvanced Emote Channeling&amp;n
The purpose of this OOC lesson is to improve the quality and 
entertainment value of the student&apos;s channeling emotes. Some of 
these principles apply to all types of RP, but some are specific to 
channeling. The lesson should expose the student to the 
following concepts: 
 
&amp;cDetail:&amp;n
One simple method for improving emotes is to add minor details. 
This helps the audience visualize the scene better and also helps 
avoid ambiguity. Adding hand gestures or facial expressions to 
an emote is simple, but it adds greatly to the scene. An extra 
quality that can be noted in channeling emotes is the glow of 
Saidar. It brightens as one draws more of the Power and dims as 
she draws less. Do not confuse detail with verbosity. Some 
people feel that a long emote equals a good emote. This is not 
entirely accurate. More detail in an emote is good. Just adding 
garbage to pad the length of an emote is not good. Avoid putting 
a dozen actions into one emote simply to increase the length. 
Example of a long, bad emote: 
&amp;yJane weaves a fireball at Joe. Jane weaves a lightning bolt at 
Joe. Jane tosses another fireball from each hand at Joe. Jane 
tries to gentle Joe. &amp;n
 
There is no detail in that emote, just several actions. An example 
of a detailed emote without too much action: 
&amp;yJane embraces Saidar and spins out a thick thread of Air to loop 
around the handle of the kettle. The golden glow around her 
brightens, her brow furrowing in concentration, as she draws in 
more of the One Power to lift the kettle off the stove. She 
gestures casually towards the table as the kettle begins to float 
towards it. &amp;n
 
This is much preferable to something like: 
&amp;yJane channels air to lift the kettle. &amp;n

&amp;cPemote:&amp;n
Pemote is one of our emote-like commands that can be used to 
spruce up our RP. It is a personal emote or targetted emote. It is 
used to send one emote to the target and a separate emote to 
the rest of the room. It is useful for channeling emotes, such as 
Healing, where the target receives much more information than 
the rest of the observers. In non-channeling emotes, it is useful 
for such things as kicking an overly talkative companion in the leg 
beneath the table. For example, if one typed: 
 
&amp;Cpemote Joe weaves flows of Air, Water and Spirit together into a 
complex skein. She places her hands on your head and passes 
the weave throughout your body, causing a chill to ripple through 
you as the wounds begin to knit closed.|places her hands on 
Joe&apos;s head and passes a complex skein of Air, Water and Spirit 
through his body, healing his wounds. &amp;n
 
Joe would see: 
&amp;yJane weaves flows of Air, Water and Spirit together into a 
complex skein. She places her hands on your head and passes 
the weave throughout your body, causing a chill to ripple through 
you as the wounds begin to knit closed. &amp;n
 
The rest of the room would see: 
&amp;yJane places her hands on Joe&apos;s head and passes a complex 
skein of Air, Water and Spirit through his body, healing his 
wounds. &amp;n
 
In most situations, pemote is not very useful. It is a lot of extra 
typing. When it is useful is when dealing with people who have 
trouble separating what they see from what their characters see. 
In a non-channeling example, Jane&apos;s player types: 
 
&amp;Cpemote joe frowns deeply, but remains silent, as she kicks you in 
the ankle beneath the table.|frowns deeply but says nothing. &amp;n
 
Joe would see: 
&amp;yJane frowns deeply, but remains silent, as she kicks you in the 
ankle beneath the table. &amp;n
 
The rest of the room sees: 
&amp;yJane frowns deeply but says nothing. &amp;n
 
There are many poor RPers that if this had been done as an 
emote, would have suddenly ICly known that Jane surreptitiously 
kicked Joe. They can be gotten around with pemote.

      <description>&amp;cBasic Weave Improvisation&amp;n

This OOC lesson should teach the student how to work out on 
her own how to emote weaves not specifically taught in the 
syllabus. Examples would be freezing water or putting out a fire. 
All the possible weaves can&apos;t be covered in this lesson. That -is- 
sort of the point of the lesson. 
 
The simplest solution that still satisfies the conditions of the 
problem is usually the best solution. Molding clay is a good 
example. One could channel water to moisten the clay and make 
it easier to work. Then one could use Fire to warm it and make it 
more malleable. Then once it is moist and warm enough, one 
could use flows of Air to manipulate it. The simplest solution, 
however, would be just to use flows of Earth. 
 
Something else to consider, and even emphasize, during this 
lesson is the student&apos;s own strengths and weaknesses in the One 
Power. In the previous example of molding clay, Earth would be 
the ideal power to use. However, there are cases where the 
student is totally inept at weaving Earth, but perhaps has a strong 
affinity for weaving Air. Sometimes the simplest solution doesn&apos;t 
work because the student&apos;s strengths and weaknesses with the 
One Power do not allow it to. 
 
Another emphasis of the lesson should be encouraging the 
student to consider the information in the Flow Theory lesson 
when constructing multiple thread weaves. 
 
Another topic that should be covered is splitting of flows. It is 
made rather clear early on in the series that it is very difficult for 
most Aes Sedai to do multiple things at once. Since every last 
novice seems to think that she is the next Caraighan Maconar, 
doing two weaves at once should be possible, but not at first. A 
young novice would have enough trouble dealing with one 
weave. At any event, even a full Sedai who does four things at 
once should be made horrendous fun of in order to encourage 
her to never do something so stupid again. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="acting2">
      <description>&amp;cBe confident.&amp;n
Try to always act sure of yourself. In the books, Aes Sedai rarely 
have to channel to impose their will. Issue suggestions in such a 
way that it is clear that although they are in the polite form of a 
request, they are most definitely orders. Act mildly surprised if 
your commands, suddenly transformed into incredibly reasonable 
suggestions, are not followed. Make it clear from your attitude, 
not your words, that not obeying you is merely an act of 
childishness. Try to never outwardly show fear. There were many 
scenes in the books of Aes Sedai calmly, nonchalantly facing 
Asha&apos;man. Then, once they were alone, quickly confiding in their 
sisters that those men made them want to scream in terror. To 
paraphrase a quote from a bad western movie, &apos;Nothing unsettles 
a man more than you standing your ground and looking him in the 
eye when every ounce of common sense says you should be 
running like hell.&apos; If this confidence annoys someone to the point 
that he points out exactly how outmatched you are, simply smile 
mysteriously as if you know something he does not. Perhaps 
even confirm that he is correct and smile even more. 
&amp;yThe Asha&apos;man sneers disdainfully at the small woman and spits 
out in an arrogant tone,&apos;I have you shielded, Aes Sedai. There is 
no way you can free yourself.&apos; &amp;n
 
&amp;yJane&apos;s cheek dimples as an amused smile slowly spreads across 
her face. She presses tentatively against the shield once, then 
stops, her smile growing even more amused. Softly, she 
replies, &apos;It would certainly seem that you have the upper hand.&apos;
She seems barely able to suppress a chuckle. &amp;n
 
Inside, Jane is likely thinking to herself, &apos;Oh light! Someone 
please help me!!!&apos; Years of Aes Sedai training enables her to 
outwardly keep her calm, even if she does feel like wetting 
herself. 
 
&amp;cTake charge.&amp;n
Aes Sedai are important. They are revered, respected and even 
feared. They are used to being listened to and of being in charge. 
Use this. Certainly, you would not do this if you are hiding your 
identity, but if you are in a situation where you are already known 
to be Aes Sedai and there is turmoil, you are not only allowed, 
but almost expected, to step in and handle the situation. Also, 
never explain yourself or your actions unless you absolutely must. 
Express annoyance if you do have to explain. Even then, do not 
fully explain. It is hard to be mysterious if you tell everyone 
exactly what you are up to all the time. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="acting">
      <description>&amp;cActing the Part&amp;n
It should be impressed upon the student that Aes Sedai are 
viewed as mysterious, confident, cryptic, regal and wise. The 
following tips are just examples of little tricks one can use to try to 
portray a character who has more life experience and knowledge 
than it would ever be possible for a player to gain. Each player 
will, or should, develope her own personal style. These are just 
some, not all, of the possible ways one can attempt to appear 
Sedai-like. 
 
&amp;cLie without lying.&amp;n
Be extremely careful to never lie. Aes Sedai are world famous for 
making people believe totally incorrect things without ever lying. 
 
One of the easiest methods of doing this is to simply not correct 
someone else when they make a false statement. Allowing them 
to continue to believe something you know to be untrue is not 
lying. Having someone else lie for you is another tried and true 
lesson. Some think that warders are vital more for this than for 
the protection their swords offer. Ordering someone to tell a lie is 
not lying yourself. 
&amp;yJoe steps forward and gestures towards Jane as he says, &apos;Her 
name is Liersa.&apos; &amp;n
 
A more advanced form of this concept is convincing, or having 
someone else convince, another Aes Sedai that something is true 
when it is not. An Aes Sedai can be wrong, but she cannot speak 
statements she knows to be untrue. In the books, many Rebel 
Sedai are spreading the lies that the Red Ajah helped Logain rise 
to power as a false Dragon. They are not violating their Oaths, 
because they believe it, having been told by someone they think 
cannot lie. 
 
Avoid directly answering questions. If someone asks your name 
and you wish them not to know it, do not respond with &apos;I am 
-whoever-.&apos; Giving someone permission to do something is not 
lying, so you could respond, &apos;You may call me -insert whatever
pseudonym you like-.&apos; Feel free to ignore questions posed to you 
and then make unrelated statements. An example from the books 
would be when Moiraine was asked why she was in the Two 
Rivers. The truthful answer to the question would have been, &apos;I 
am seeking the Dragon Reborn.&apos; She ignored that question 
however and simply made the statement, &apos;I am interested in old 
stories.&apos; Since she cannot lie, it is a true statement that she is 
interested in old stories. Had she answered the question with that 
statement by saying something such as, &apos;I am here for the sole 
purpose of learning the old stories of your region.&apos; That would 
have been a lie. 
 
Preparation is one of the keys. If you are going on a mission, the 
secrecy of which is vital, have a secondary goal as well. For 
example, if you are going to Cairhien to spy on the Dragon 
Reborn, do more than one thing with the trip. There is a world 
famous library in the city. Plan to visit it. Then, when asked why 
you are in the city, you can truthfully respond, &apos;I plan to visit the 
Royal Library.&apos;
 
Make a habit of answering in such a manner even when you are 
not trying to misdirect. If people spend a lot of time carefully 
considering your exact wording on every statement, there is more 
possibility of the important ones slipping through. Even if you are 
simply in the garden to look at the flowers, couching it in evasive 
terms will help in the long run, and make you seem more like an 
Aes Sedai. &apos;Aren&apos;t these flowers lovely?&apos; The suspicious will 
naturally assume that you are hiding some other agenda by the 
evasive answer. It helps keep them off balance. 
 
If there is simply no way to truthfully respond to an uncomfortable 
question with misdirection, do not answer. Ignore it and respond 
with a question of your own. For example, if you are trying to 
steal the crown jewels and are asked, &apos;Why are you here in the 
palace?&apos; You could respond, &apos;Have you seen my ink pen?&apos; 
Questions are never lies. And of course, there is always, &apos;I am an 
Aes Sedai, child. I am not here to be interrogated by such as 
you.&apos;

      <description>&amp;cPost-Raising Aes Sedai Lecture&amp;n
There are some bits of knowledge that women simply are not 
entrusted with until they attain the shawl. 

&amp;cIgnoring Heat and Cold:&amp;n
Aes Sedai are rarely seen to sweat. It takes great stress to 
disturb their concentration enough to cause them to lose control 
to that point. They also do not seem to be touched by the cold. It 
is not a thing of the power, simply a trick of the mind. Exactly how 
this is done is never explained, but that matters little. One doesn&apos;t 
need to know how to do it, just how to emote it. 
&amp;yJane turns her cool gaze on the man who is sweating and 
nervously shifting his weight from one foot to the other. She 
arches an eyebrow at him, her own face dry, the heat seemingly 
not affecting her. Imperiously, she asks,&quot;Is there any particular;reason you are nervous?&quot; &amp;n

&amp;cThe Kin:&amp;n
Many of the girls who come to the Tower aren&apos;t suitable for 
raising to the shawl and are sent away with a warning never to 
channel again. There are also girls who aren&apos;t accepted for 
training because they are considered too old, and there are girls 
who run away. Whilst tracking down runaways, Aes Sedai 
discovered a secret group of women known only as the Kin, who 
took in such girls. They have their base in Ebou Dar and focus 
their talents on Healing. They believe firmly that their secret is still 
intact and Aes Sedai are ignorant of their presence, but infact the 
Kin are simply ignored. It is considered better to have the women 
grouped together and guided than alone in the world. That is 
really the extent of what the Aes Sedai know of the Kin. Most of 
the information on them in the books is stuff that most Aes Sedai 
simply would not believe. (We can be damn arrogant sometimes.) 

&amp;cBeing Turned:&amp;n
The ability to channel is a great tool to be used against the 
Shadow in service to the Light. It is also a weakness. This is not 
normally told to Aes Sedai until after they are raised to the Shawl, 
but it is possible for thirteen dreadlords channeling through 
thirteen myrrdraal to turn a channeler to the Shadow against his 
or her will. 

If anyone notices anything blatant that should be known by Aes 
Sedai but that is not represented anywhere in the syllabus, she 
should inform the GLs of that. She will be rewarded with quest 
points. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="restricted">
      <description>&amp;cRestricted Aes Sedai Weaves&amp;n

These weaves are rediscovered lost Talents or newly discovered 
abilities for the most part. Some of them are things that some Aes 
Sedai know, but have not bothered to share with others. The GLs 
will be the final arbiters on whether one can obtain these weaves. 

&amp;KTravelling:&amp;n This is a complex weave of Spirit that requires great 
strength in the one power to use. Fewer than one Aes Sedai in 
ten has the ability to form a gate of useable size. Luckily, there 
are over four hundred full Aes Sedai in Salidar, so most of the 
player characters can be among that small percentage that does 
have the strength. We have no book reference for the Tower, but 
the percentage should be the same. The rules on obtaining this 
weave differ slightly in the two guilds. One should speak to the 
GL of her particular guild for specifics on acquiring the weave. 
This intricate weave of spirit is used to form a similarity. Basically, 
the spot occupied by the weave is altered to make it more and 
more similar to the destination one is trying to reach until they are 
the same spot, at which point, the gateway will open. One must 
know the departure point very well in order to Travel from it. This 
familiarity requires several hours in the place, although the time 
will vary slightly from person to person and is reduced a good 
deal (about half) by holding the Power the entire time. The edges 
of the gateway are incredibly sharp and will cut through anything 
in their way or that passes through them. Therefore, it is very 
dangerous to gate into a highly populated area. 
&amp;yJane weaves threads of Spirit into a complex weave as she 
concentrates on her destination. Abruptly, a slash of light appears 
and rapidly widens into a sharp-edged hole in the air through 
which can be seen a quiet forest glade. &amp;n

&amp;KInvisibility:&amp;n This weave is a screen of Air and Spirit used to bend 
light around the target causing it to be unseen. It should be noted 
that the weave is anchored to a place, not a person, and provides 
invisibility only if the person does not move out of the protected 
area. 
&amp;yJane weaves a screen of Air laced with Spirit and gradually 
reshapes it into a dome over the campsite, rendering the small 
group invisible to all outside the weave. &amp;n

&amp;WHeal Gentling/Stilling:&amp;n If one delves a person who has been 
gentled or stilled, she will something inside them that seems to 
have been cut, leaving a gap. If the ends are held with Spirit, the 
gap can be bridged with Fire, restoring the link and allowing the 
person to channel again. This description is purposely vague, as 
the current MUD policy requires that a person apply for this ability 
and that they have already previously been approved for an 
Affinity for Healing. Part of the application process requires that 
the person show strong understanding of the ability. It would 
hardly be fair to the application process to provide all the 
information for the weave here. 

&amp;YEavesdropping:&amp;n A proving thread of Air slightly enhanced with 
Spirit forms a conduit for conducting sound. It can be slipped 
under the edge of a door and then the end formed into a sort of 
parabolic shape to catch the sounds or attached to a window to 
pick up the vibrations from the room. Alternately, it can be 
attached to a ward against eavesdropping instead of a window. 
The person who wove the ward would have to be very much 
occupied with other things to not notice this last type of 
eavesdropping, though. Some Aes Sedai have different 
variations on this weave. Moiraine, for example, uses a small 
gemstone as a focus for the weave. 
&amp;yJane weaves a slender thread of Air lightly touched with Spirit 
and presses it against the pane of the window. A frown of 
concentration creases her brow as she listens to the conversation 
in the other room. &amp;n
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="common2">
      <description>&amp;YL&amp;Wig&amp;wh&amp;Wt&amp;Kn&amp;Win&amp;wg&amp;W:&amp;n The Aes Sedai who know this weave likely only learn 
the form of it and do not understand the science involved, but the 
weave is composed of Air laced liberally with Fire. The Air is used 
to stimulate air molecules and build up static. Fire is used to 
greatly increase the energy in this process. The difficulty of this 
weave varies depending on the existing conditions. Most women 
lack the strength to do this out of a cloudless sky, although one 
with a strong Talent for Cloud Dancing would find it less difficult. 
Even if conditions are stormy, this is one of those operations that 
is quite fatiguing. This weave can be devastating against closely 
packed units of troops, not just for the destructive ability, but also 
for the panic it can cause. Against single targets, it is much less 
useful, as it is not very accurate and extremely difficult to aim with 
precision. 
&amp;yJane leans out over the parapet, eyes narrowing as she surveys 
the besieging troops. Weaving thick flows of entwined Fire and 
Air, she calls a forked bolt of lightning down into the thickest 
concentration of milling Trollocs, closing her eyes just as she 
completes the weave to avoid the flash. As she releases Saidar, 
she seems almost to deflate, shoulders sagging wearily, the 
thunder and screams of the troops drowning out her tired sigh. &amp;n


&amp;WT&amp;wo&amp;Wk&amp;we&amp;Wn&amp;w:&amp;n This is a weave of Spirit used to keep track of a target. It 
requires giving them an item, metal seems to work best, and 
weaving Spirit through both the item and the target to form an 
affinity. After this, as long as the target keeps the item, the Aes 
Sedai can sense the target&apos;s general direction and distance, 
much as one can with one&apos;s warder. As a side effect of the 
weave, most targets will have an unconscious tendency to keep 
the item with them. 
&amp;yJane hands Joe a small, intricately engraved silver medallion and 
says,&quot;I would like for you to have this.&quot; As he takes the item, she 
sends thin, complexly woven threads of Spirit through both the 
medallion and the man, forming a sort of bond between the three 
of them. &amp;n
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="common">
      <description>&amp;cCommon Aes Sedai Weaves&amp;n
\c00The purpose of this document is to list some of the more common 
weaves that would be taught to Aes Sedai after they are raised to 
the shawl. While most Accepted, especially the more advanced 
ones, would have the skill and facility to learn these weaves, they 
are not taught to them for various reasons. The combat weaves 
are not taught to them because they have not sworn the Oaths 
yet. Some of them are simply not needed by women cloistered in 
the Tower and unable to roam the world on their own and yet 
others require a certain level of responsibility. 


&amp;RGentle/Still:&amp;n This is a Spirit weave very similar to the Shield 
weave. The difference is that instead of being a blunt wedge of 
Spirit, the gentling weave is tightened to a sharp edge and 
instead of just pushing the target away from the One Power, it 
permanently cuts them off from it. It takes a massive strength 
advantage to successfully use this weave against someone. In 
practice, it is unlikely that a single player character can ever 
successfully use this weave against another. Tower Tradition 
calls for a circle of thirteen to perform all gentlings or stillings. 
&amp;yJane draws in more power from the twelve women linked to her 
and stares down at the bound and shielded man kneeling in the 
center of their circle. With an almost sympathetic look on her 
face, she weaves thick flows of Spirit, gradually tightening them 
until they form a wedge with a razor-like sharp edge. In a motion 
similar to a striking viper, she brings the weave down sharply on 
the man&apos;s connection to tainted Saidin, forever severing him from 
the Source. &amp;n

&amp;WMask of Mirrors:&amp;n This weave causes the illusion that the weaver 
is growing. It should be used sparingly as it is incredibly unsubtle. 
The only real use of this weave is to frighten and impress and 
remind people that the weaver is indeed an Aes Sedai and 
therefore a force to be reckoned with. It should be noted that 
other uses of Saidar will see the weave, spoiling the illusion for 
them. 
&amp;yJane weaves a complex shell of Air and Spirit around herself. 
Gradually she adds strength to the weave, expanding it, creating 
the illusion that she is growing until she appears to be close to 
fifty feet tall and staring the guard on the wall straight in the eye. &amp;n

&amp;RF&amp;Yi&amp;Rr&amp;Ye&amp;Rb&amp;Ya&amp;Rl&amp;Yl&amp;R:&amp;n This weave consists of a thin shell of Air, formed into a 
hollow sphere to contain a mass of jumbled-up flows of Fire. The 
entire construct is sent hurtling towards the target, and upon 
reaching a close enough proximity, the Air is tightened up to bring 
it into close association with the Fire, thereby bringing about a 
concussive blast of flame and heat sufficient to burn a cluster of 
attackers and throw them violently about. Due to the fairly 
complex nature of the weaving, and to its concussive traits, it is 
best used at a distance to give time to weave it properly and to 
avoid injury to oneself. 
&amp;yJane weaves a chaotic jumble of threads of Fire surrounded by a 
hollow shell of Air. She hurls it down the slope at the charging 
Trollocs, her fist tightening in time with the shell of Air just as the 
weave reaches the creatures. The flaming missile suddenly 
erupts into a concussive burst of flame, the blast knocking 
several of the trollocs over and burning many others. &amp;n

      <description>&amp;cMachin Shin&amp;n

After the breaking of the world, a group of male Aes Sedai took 
refuge from the taint inside the Ogier stedding. After a while, the 
call of Saidin became too much for them and they left the 
stedding. In exchange for giving them sanctuary, these male Aes 
Sedai gave the Ogier a valuable gift, the Ways. Grown from the 
One Power in a way no longer understood, the Ways connected 
all the known stedding. These Ways were separate from the 
pattern. Even when the Ways connected two areas which were 
separated by the shattering of the land, the Ways remained 
unchanged. These Aes Sedai also gave the Ogier the Talisman 
of Growing, a ter&apos;angreal which could be used to grow the Ways 
to other stedding as they were discovered after the Breaking. 

For nearly two thousand years the Ogier used the Ways to move 
between stedding. The Ways were well lighted, and covered with 
a thick grass, and the islands within the Ways were also filled 
with large fruit trees which could be enjoyed by travelers. The 
Ways were a beautiful place in tune with nature, much like the 
Ogier stedding they connected. 

All that changed around the time of the War of the Hundred 
Years. The Ways darkened, and the living things disappeared. 
The stone itself became pitted and decayed. Travelers 
sometimes entered the Ways and never came out, or came out 
drastically changed. 

One of the most terrifying discoveries during this deterioration 
was that of Machin Shin, the Black Wind. Those who are touched 
by the Black Wind lose their minds and their souls. None know 
for certain where Machin Shin came from but there are two likely 
possibilities: that it is a product of the taint on Saidin which was 
used to create the Ways, or that it is a parasite living off the 
Ways. 

Fire can be used against Machin Shin, but the black wind cannot

      <description>&amp;cMashadar&amp;n

To explain the evil that is mashadar its easiest to consider what
created it. 

Roughly two hundred years after the Breaking of the World the 
Compact of the Ten Nations was formed. Society flourished in the 
hopes of regaining the wonders of the Age of Legends, and one 
of the nations in this compact was Aridhol. For hundreds of years 
the Compact held, and these nations flourished, until the Trollocs 
came howling out of the Blight at around 1000 AB. 

A man named Mordeth came to Aridhol at this time, gaining the 
ear of King Balwen Mayel. The king thought perhaps Mordeth 
had the solution, use the tactics of the Shadow against the 
Shadow. The people of Aridhol hardened and became isolated. It 
became a place to be avoided by even their former allies. The 
people of Aridhol abandoned the Light, their hatred and suspicion 
spawning the evil that is Mashadar. 

As Balwen withered, Mordeth became the true power in Aridhol. 
Prince Caar, the son of King Thorin of Manetheren, came to try 
and win Aridhol back to the Compact. Mordeth had Caar 
imprisoned as a Darkfriend, but he escaped and fled. When an 
army from Manetheren came to avenge Caar, they found nothing 
living within the city. The evil the folk of Aridhol had created had 
destroyed them. From then on the city would be called Shadar 
Logath. 

Mashadar is some sort of physical manifestation of the evil nature 
of the city. No enemy had come to Aridhol but Aridhol itself. 
Suspicion and hate had given birth to something that fed on that 
which created it, something locked in the bedrock on which the 
city stood. 

Physically, Mashadar is a slightly glowing fog. It moves through 
the city as aimlessly as a worm burrows through the earth, its 
touch bringing death. It is not sentient. As a hint of how strong the 
evil of Mashadar is, Moraine believed that the whole of the White 
Tower working together could not kill or neutralize the evil of 
Mashadar in Shadar Logath. Even Trollocs will not enter the city 
without Myrddraal to force them, and something fierce to drive the 
Myrddraal.

    <exdesc keyword="link">
      <description>&amp;cLinking&amp;n

Linking is a method where Aes Sedai can combine their 
strengths. It is not very efficient, but in cases where raw strength 
is important, it can be very useful. After scouring the web for 
theories and models on the workings of the One Power, the 
author has discovered that the consensus seems to be that about 
thirty percent of the total strength of the linked members is lost. 
To clarify, the total strength seems to be the leader of the circle 
plus around seventy percent of the total of the rest of the circle. 

In order to link, one person must lead the circle. She begins by 
embracing the source. Any others who are to join the circle 
prepare to embrace, but hold themselves just at the point of 
readiness, not actually embracing. The leader of the circle then 
embraces through them, drawing them into the link. Up to thirteen 
women can join in this method. A circle of thirteen would be 
strong enough to easily shield or gentle even the Dragon. 

It is important to note that only the leader of a circle can do any 
active channeling. The other members are essentially helpless, 
only able to point out things to the leader that need her attention. 
Feelings experienced while linked are similar to those in the 
bond, although there are some differences. If a member of the 
link is injured, it will be felt by the other members of the link. If a 
member is rended unconscious, the shock will almost certainly 
shatter the link, likely rendering other members of the link 
unconscious as well. If a member of the link is killed, it would be 
unlikely for any members to remain conscious, and the trauma 
could conceivable kill another of the weaker members.

    <exdesc keyword="tying">
      <description>&amp;cKnotting:&amp;n
Knotting or tying a weave is a method whereby a weave can be 
left in existance without the need for the weaver to maintain it. 
The name comes from the fact that the threads of the One Power 
used in the weave are tied into knots so the structure will support 
itself. In most cases, the knots are rather simple, although it is 
possible to tie more elaborate knots to prevent someone else 
from untying to weave or at least to make it more difficult for 
them. In roleplay, this is very simple. You just do it. A couple of 
examples: 
&amp;yJane channels flows of Air, spinning them into a tighly spun plate 
to form a hard barrier to shelter the small alcove from random 
arrows. Deftly she ties the weave off and turns to concentrate on 
the wounded man huddling beside her. &amp;n
Or
&amp;yJane smiles grimly as the shield of Spirit slides into place, 
separating the Accepted from the True Source. Her smile turns to 
a frown of concentration as she ties the weave in an elaborate 
knot. As she releases Saidar, she turns to the other student and 
says,&quot;Practice untying weaves. That shield should keep you busy 
and out of trouble for hours.&quot; &amp;n

&amp;cUnknotting:&amp;n
This consists of using flows of Spirit to knock or pick apart the 
knot holding a weave in place. One method is to use the fine 
thread of Spirit to untie the knot, or pick it apart much like one 
would use his fingernails on a knot in a piece of string. Another 
method is to insert a thin thread of Spirit inside the knot and &quot;flex&quot; 
it, shattering the knot. The second method only works on simple 
knots. A complex knot would require slowly and carefully untying 
it. It should be noted that one can only untie weaves she can see. 
A woman would be unable to unknot a weave made of Saidin, or 
one made by a man and a woman linked. Examples: 

&amp;yJane examines the knotted weave for a moment, then embraces 
Saidar. She spins out a very fine thread of Spirit and slowly 
worms it inside the knot. Once it is fully inside, she pulses more 
strength into the thread, expanding it as if flexing a muscle hard. 
The knot shatters and the weave it held unravels. &amp;n
Or
&amp;yJane channels, snaking out a fine thread of Spirit and uses it to 
slowly pick apart the knot on the Airwall weave. As she finally 
works the knot apart, she steps back and folds her hands 
together at her waist, smiling serenely as she watches the weave 
dissipate. &amp;n

    <exdesc keyword="weather">
      <description>&amp;cWeather Control&amp;n
Aes Sedai do not normally interfere with the weather unless there 
is dire need, as any change will have repercussions and far-
reaching, unpredictable effects. For example, if the weather were 
manipulated to bring rain to one region in need of it, another 
region would likely suffer an unnatural dry spell. The problem is a 
bit more serious than that, though. It is not predictable enough for 
the decision to be about trading the prosperity of one region for 
that of another. Changing the weather to provide favorable 
prevailing winds to speed the Amyrlin&apos;s journey upriver, could 
easily cause unwanted droughts or flooding in totally unexpected 
places - paraphrased from a partially remembered example from 
The Great Hunt. 

Manipulating the weather is very fatiguing. It is a slow process 
sometimes requiring hours of weaving flows of Air high into the 
atmosphere. If one does not have a natural facility for this, it can 
take several women linked or working in conjunction. Part of the 
difficulty is that great care must be taken. The affects the change 
will have on other weather is a disturbing enough prospect, but 
careless or hasty manipulation can result in accidents that cause 
violent storms. 
&amp;RNOTE:&amp;n Because of the non-interference trend, much of the facility 
with weather control or Cloud Dancing, as the Talent is 
sometimes called, has been lost. An example of this from the 
series would be how amazed Elayne was at how much more the 
Windfinders knew of working with weather than the Aes Sedai. 
Also, although women will still be taught the weaves, affecting the 
weather is impossible right now. The influence of the Dark One 
has the world stuck in a perpetual summer drought. There is little 
need to go into more detail on the weaves involved in this 
particular ability when one considers that the ability simply cannot 
be used at this current time and, even if it could be, since the 
process is so time-consuming, it would most likely be RP that is 
done out of the scene.

      <description>&amp;cWhite Tower Political Relations&amp;n
This list explains the relations the White Tower has with other 
groups that exist on the mud. Obviously this won&apos;t be true for all 
Aes Sedai, but is the Tower&apos;s general stance on these groups. 

&amp;GThe Rebel Tower:&amp;n Uneasy. The rebels are currently staying in 
the small town of Salidar, under the leadership of the false 
Amyrlin, Egwene al&apos;Vere. They are not to be trusted, specifically 
those who were raised to the shawl in the town and have not 
sworn the Three Oaths on the Oath Rod. Any true Aes Sedai 
may return to her rightful place in the Tower, and will be forgiven. 
The false Aes Sedai will be put back in novice white. 
&amp;KAsha&apos;man:&amp;n Hostile. These men have a liking for kidnapping and 
bonding Aes Sedai, but are supposedly kept under control by the 
Dragon Reborn, Rand al&apos;Thor. They patrol in Caemlyn often. It is 
a very, very bad idea to channel in the presence of one. As they 
are male channelers, they are utterly repulsive to most Aes Sedai 
for the simple reason that we know what the taint is, and what it 
has done to the world in the past. Important Caemlyn Note: The 
Dragon Reborn, Rand al&apos;Thor is in control of the city in the 
Queen&apos;s absence. He has an edict in place stating that any 
woman who wishes to be allowed to channel should identify 
herself to the Queen&apos;s Guard and wear visible identification 
(shawl/ring), or run the risk of being arrested by the Asha&apos;man. 
&amp;WChildren of the Light:&amp;n Foe. A whitecloak will stop at nothing to 
see an Aes Sedai, whom they call &apos;witches&apos;, dead. They feel the 
same about warders. Avoid at all costs, although most 
whitecloaks won&apos;t be foolish enough to try arresting an Aes Sedai 
in public. 
&amp;mNobility:&amp;n Most nobles respect Aes Sedai, but many cannot be 
trusted as they are deeply involved in the game of houses. 
&amp;YH&amp;yu&amp;Yn&amp;yt&amp;Ye&amp;yr&amp;Ys&amp;y o&amp;Yf&amp;y t&amp;Yh&amp;ye&amp;Y H&amp;yo&amp;Yr&amp;yn&amp;Y:&amp;n Will often be nosy for information about 
the Horn. They are NOT to know where the horn is, or who 
sounded it. Tell them nothing at all, other than the simple history 
that most hunters are already well versed in. 
&amp;RDragonsworn:&amp;n Hostile. A group of fanatics that follows the 
&apos;prophet&apos; and preaches the ways of the Dragon Reborn, and the 
evils of Aes Sedai. This prophet, Masema, is delusional and 
should not be trifled with. 
&amp;rBand of the Red Hand:&amp;n A large group of mercenaries led by 
Matrim Cauthon, a childhood friend of the Dragon Reborn. He is 
known to be strongly ta&apos;veren. Little else is known of them. 
&amp;yAiel:&amp;n People from across the Spine of the World. They have high 
respect for Aes Sedai in their history. The Shaido, however, are 
outright hostile. 
&amp;rSeanchan:&amp;n Foe/Rumor. Little firm information is known, but 
rumor says that they use the One Power in battle. Treat 
tentatively. 
&amp;yOgier:&amp;n Most are friendly and also respect Aes Sedai, but beware 
of those who actually wield weapons. 
&amp;GTinkers:&amp;n Harmless. They are followers of the pacifistic Way of 
the Leaf. They are also known as the Travelling People. They 
move around the countryside in their garishly painted wagons 
seeking the song.

    <exdesc keyword="ajah">
      <description>
&amp;RThe Red Ajah:&amp;n This ajah is responsible for tracking down men 
who can channel and bringing them to the tower for gentling. 
Sisters of the Red Ajah do not take Gaidin, and often have very 
little trust for men in general. Most of them believe that a man 
who can channel and doesn&apos;t turn himself over for gentling is a 
darkfriend. There are no Red sisters in Salidar. 
&amp;BThe Blue Ajah:&amp;n A Sister of this ajah will dedicate her life to a 
specific cause. There are no sisters of the Blue Ajah in the White 
Tower. Their banners have been torn down and their color 
removed from the dresses of Accepted and the stole of the 
Amyrlin. 
&amp;WThe White Ajah:&amp;n Sisters of this ajah devote themselves to the 
study of logic and reason. Although it is not universal, the 
stereotypical White will be cold and distant. Many think that 
emotion interferes with logical, rational decisions. 
&amp;KThe Grey Ajah:&amp;n The province of this ajah is mediation. The 
Sisters of the Grey are sent to negotiate treaties, end wars and 
prevent conflicts. They are typically well versed in diplomacy and 
the laws of many nations. 
&amp;YThe Yellow Ajah:&amp;n The Sisters of this ajah are all interested in 
Healing and the study of disease and ailments. Although talented 
Healers can be found in other ajahs, the absolute best are in the 
Yellow. All of its members are above average with the Talent. 
However, it is the interest, not the Talent, that defines the ajah. 
&amp;yThe Brown Ajah:&amp;n The Brown ajah dedicates itself to study and 
research. They are interested not only in history, but also 
artifacts. Most of the women who study ter&apos;angreal are from the 
Brown. The stereotypical Brown seems lost in thought much of 
the time and is less concerned with her appearance than would 
by typical of a member of another ajah. Wool dresses are much 
more common than silk. 
&amp;gThe Green Ajah:&amp;n The Green is also called the Battle Ajah. All 
Ajahs will stand against the Shadow at the Last Battle, but the 
Green devotes itself to preparing for it. They prepare not only for 
the last battle, but they fought against the Dreadlords in the 
Trolloc Wars. This is the only ajah whose members take more 
than one warder each. Women of other ajahs typically consider 
Greens to be flirtatious. 

If the student wishes additional information on any particular Ajah, 
she should seek out an experienced member of that Ajah to 
question either ICly or OOCly.

    <exdesc keyword="accrules">
      <description>&amp;cAccepted Rules, Behavior and Etiquette&amp;n

Accepted must curtsey to, respect and obey all Aes Sedai. 

Just as when Novices, Accepted should use common sense and 
discretion when dealing with males of any rank. Chatting about 
the weather in a public place is perfectly acceptable. Canoodling 
in a private corner of the garden is not. 

Accepted can supervise Novices in chores such as kitchen work 
or outside labor, and assign chores and duties to Novices when 
there isn&apos;t an Aes Sedai or the MoN to do it. 

Accepted should aid the Aes Sedai in any kind of work they do, 
and help instruct Novices - both lessons on channelling and 
lectures. 

Tower Accepted can leave the Tower without permission, but 
should ask if they wish to leave Tar Valon. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="angreal">
      <description>&amp;cAngreal:&amp;n
Angreal are objects that allow a channeler to safely draw more 
of the One Power than she normally can. In addition to 
increasing how much power she can hold, an angreal acts as a 
buffer to help prevent overdrawing. Angreal are specific to either 
Saidar or Saidin. If one can be used by a woman, then it will be 
useless to a man and vice versa. The angreal provided in the 
guild equipment are entirely OOC. If one would like information 
on acquiring an IC angreal, she should speak to the IMM GL for 
the current policies and status of items of the Power. 

In order to use an angreal, a woman would embrace almost as 
normal, except that she would draw Saidar through the angreal 
instead of directly. In the books, it is never really described more 
clearly than this. In roleplay, this is incredibly simple. An 
example: 
&amp;yJane holds the small heartstone rose in the palm of her hand 
and embraces the One Power, drawing Saidar through the rose. 
The golden glow springs up immediately around her, much 
brighter than usual as she holds well more Power than she can 
unaided.&amp;n 

Identifying angreal is not complex. If a woman trained in 
channeling touches a female angreal, she will instantly know its 
nature. There is no known way for her to identify a male 
angreal, however. 

&amp;cSa&apos;angreal:&amp;n
Sa&apos;angreal are similar to angreal, but much more powerful. A 
Sa&apos;angreal would allow a woman to hold as much more power 
than an angreal as an angreal would allow her to hold over 
being unaided. They are used in exactly the same manner. 

&amp;cTer&apos;angreal:&amp;n
Instead of aiding a channeler in using the Power, ter&apos;angreal are 
designed to perform specific tasks. Some of them work only for 
men, some only for women, some for both, and some do not 
require channeling ability at all. An incredibly wide range of 
functions can be performed with ter&apos;angreal. This causes it to be 
extremely dangerous to tinker with one if its function is not 
understood. Women have been injured, stilled or even killed by 
experimenting on strange ter&apos;angreal.

    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="shielding">
      <description>&amp;cThe Shield Weave&amp;n
This is a rather simple weave of Spirit shaped into a wedge and 
pushed between the target and her connection to the One 
Power. If the target is caught unawares, this is not a very 
difficult task to accomplish. If she resists, it is quite a difficult 
task, requiring a strength advantage in the One Power. If the 
target is embracing the source, it is that much harder still. 
&amp;yJane weaves thick flows of Spirit into a wedge-shaped construct 
and shoves it at Lou Ann&apos;s connection to the Source, attempting 
to seperate her from it. &amp;n

Just as it requires a large advantage in strength to shield 
someone who is embracing, one must also be much stronger 
than one&apos;s opponent to break a shield that is being maintained. 
When dealing with male channelers, one woman is rarely able 
to shield a man. An average Aes Sedai could not shield an 
average Asha&apos;man unaided. Tradition in the Tower calls for a 
circle of thirteen to shield a man and a circle of six to maintain 
that shield. In practice, these numbers are rarely needed. 
However, there is no way for an Aes Sedai to judge a man&apos;s 
strength without trying to shield him. Since the taint makes male 
channelers so dangerous, Tradition leaves no room for error. 
Thirteen linked Aes Sedai are capable of shielding any man. 
Once the shield is in place, a circle of six is capable of holding 
that shield on any man. In most cases, non-bookie player 
characters will be dealing with other non-bookie player 
characters. It is the consensus among the channeling GLs of 
this MUD that because of the average strength difference and 
because of the inefficient strength gain from linking, a circle of 
four Sedai should be able to shield an Asha&apos;man. It might be 
possible with three, but this would be a close thing. It must be 
emphasized that this is assuming average, non-bookie player 
characters. Because of the inefficiency of linking, the strength of 
the women involved has much less impact on the number 
needed than the strength of the man. 

Conversely, from numerous examples in the books, one man is 
typically sufficient to shield an Aes Sedai. This hardly seems fair 
on the surface of it. However, thirteen of the weakest Aes Sedai 
can shield the Dragon Reborn out of hand. In those very rare 
instances where a man is not strong enough to shield a female 
opponent, he cannot link with another man to overcome her.

    <exdesc keyword="wards2">
      <description>&amp;cTrap Wards&amp;n
A trap ward is a framework of Spirit holding some other weave 
that is set to release when a certain condition occurs. Two 
examples from the books are the ward Siune Sanche had on 
her letter box when she was Amyrlin and the prank that Siuane 
and Moiraine played on one of their teachers when they were 
students in the Tower where they rigged a ball of water to drop 
on the Sister&apos;s head when she entered her apartment. This is 
likely the most complex type of warding. Exactly how it is set up 
depends on a variety of things. What triggers it? What happens 
when it is triggered? The way the weave is formed depends 
upon these answers. In a case of a box or door opening being 
the trigger, it is likely that the weave is done in three parts. In 
the exampe of the box, inside the box would be the framework 
of Spirit that holds the Fire weave. The second part is the Fire 
weave itself. The third part would be a weave of Spirit attached 
to the lid such than when the lid opens, the two weaves of Spirit 
cease touching each other, which releases the Fire weave to do 
it&apos;s set function. The same principle would apply to the trap on 
the doorway. A ward could also be set up to release a weave 
when a person passed through the warding. This would require 
a detection ward to sense the presense of the person and then 
the framework of Spirit to hold the &quot;trapped&quot; weave. For the 
most part these wards are ineffective against channelers of the 
same gender unless they are low power weaves and are 
attached to the other side of an opaque surface such as the lid 
of a box or the back of a door. Otherwise, they would be seen 
and easily avoided. 
&amp;yJane carefully refolds the letter and drops it into the ornate ivory 
case. Embracing, she quickly weaves a small web of Spirit into 
the bottom of the box. Holding that weave, she channels 
threads of Fire, as well, into a construct designed to incinerate 
the the papers in the case, but with the web of Spirit carefully 
interposed to prevent the fire weave from completing. She ties 
both weaves off deftly, leaving a loose end on the Spirit weave 
in a slip knot pattern, such that if she tugged on it, the entire 
thing would unravel. She fixes a simple thread of Spirit to the 
inside of the lid and gently lowers it, attaching that thread to the 
loose end just before the lid closes. &amp;n

    <exdesc keyword="wards">
      <description>&amp;cWards&amp;n
Wards are weaves used to keep things out or warn of their 
presense. They can also be used as traps. The three main 
types of ward covered here are detection, barrier and trap. 

&amp;cDetection Wards:&amp;n
The construction of a detection ward is dependent on what 
types of things are being detected. If one is setting up a ward to 
warn when living things contact it, then the weave will be made 
of pure Spirit. If one wanted to make an elaborate ward that 
would alert her to the presense of armored soldiers, Spirit would 
still be required for the framework of the weave and to detect 
the person, but Earth would also be required to pick up the 
presense of the metal. It is possible to refine the lifeform 
detection and narrow it down. Wards can be made to warn of 
Shadowspawn or humans. Use of Saidar should be detectable, 
as well. It is theoretically possible to narrow it down to being 
able to set up a ward to warn if a woman capable of channeling 
approaches. In fact, all of this is just theory and guesswork 
since Robert Jordan does not go into much detail or description 
when his characters weave wards. 
&amp;yJane concentrates and spins out thin threads of Spirit in a 
complex web, straining to extend it to cover the entire campsite, 
perhaps an area thirty feet in radius. As she ties off the weave 
and releases Saidar, she says with fatigue evident in her 
voice, &apos;We will be warned now if anyone attempts to surprise us 
in our sleep.&apos; &amp;n

&amp;cBarrier Wards:&amp;n
This is almost the opposite of a detection ward. Instead of being 
receptive to the presense of a certain creature or material, the 
polarity of the weave is reversed, causing it to repulse such 
things. For the most part, this is only useful for dealing with 
vermin. Aes Sedai commonly use it to keep rats and such out of 
any dwelling they may occupy. It would require a great deal of 
power to repulse anything larger. Basically this particular weave 
just generates an unpleasant sensation that causes the rats to 
avoid the warded area. An intelligent creature, such as a Fade, 
would be able to persevere through the discomfort unless the 
weave was of sufficient magnitude to kill, in which case the 
Fade would sense it from a goodly distance, rending the ward 
more of a large glowing arrow pointing out the weaver than an 
actual useful defensive weave. As with the detection ward, a 
barrier ward that keeps out living things would be compused of 
Spirit. Theoretically, it should be possible to create a ward that 
would repulse non-living objects as well, such as arrows. In 
practice,this would be next to impossible or at least so difficult 
as to make a simple shield of Air a much more feasible option. 
One practical example of a ward that repulses non-living things 
is the barrier against eavesdropping. Examples: 

&amp;yJane&apos;s eyes narrow in concentration as she weaves threads of 
Spirit into a grid pattern which grows to cover the ground level 
of the entire Inn. Her nose wrinkles slightly in further 
concentration as she carefully tunes the vibrations of the weave. 
After several long moments, she smiles in satisfaction and ties 
the weave off. Turning to the tavern keeper, she says 
softly, &quot;Thank you for your assistace, Master Brill. Your 
establishment shall be troubled by vermin no more.&quot; &amp;n
Or
&amp;yJane sighs in exasperation and then embraces the Source. As 
soon as the soft glow of Saidar surrounds her, she begins 
weaving a conical shell of Air and Spirit around herself and Sue. 
The air shimmers around them briefly before Jane says,&quot;What I 
have to tell you, Sister, is not for public consumption.&quot; &amp;n

      <description>&amp;yRend Earth:&amp;n Massive flows of Earth can be used to cause the 
ground to heave and open beneath a target&apos;s feet, much as in 
an earthquake. This is very fatiguing for most women as they do 
not have much strength in Earth. -&amp;RNOTE: As with any hostile 
weaving, care must be taken to avoid conflicts with the Oaths&amp;n-
&amp;yJane sinks thick flows of Earth into the ground in front of her, 
sending them towards the line of charging trollocs. The ground 
suddenly gapes open into a jagged ditch in front of the 
shadowspawn. As the first victims trip, screaming in rage, into 
the crevasse, she releases Saidar and staggers as if exhausted. &amp;n

&amp;yMend:&amp;n A piece of broken crockery or metal can be melded back 
together using flows of Earth. -&amp;RNOTE: Using this weave to 
repair a weapon, while not technically a direct violation of the 
second of the three oaths, is against Tower Tradition.&amp;n-
&amp;yJane holds the two broken halves of the flower pot together and 
channels thin threads of Earth into them, causing the edges to 
soften and flow together. When she releases the weave, she 
studies the pot for a moment, then mutters,&apos;Not perfect, but it 
will hold.&apos; &amp;n

&amp;CF&amp;Wi&amp;Cn&amp;Wd &amp;CW&amp;Wa&amp;Ct&amp;We&amp;Cr&amp;n: Thin, probing flows can be used for finding 
underground sources of water. Of course, this is not a 
guaranteed thing. If the water is very deep or not very plentiful, 
it will be difficult to find. There also may not be any water close 
enough to detect. If a source is found, and if one is strong in 
Earth as well and the source found is not terribly deep, one 
might be able to create a small well to bring the water to the 
surface. 

&amp;WF&amp;Ko&amp;Wg&amp;K:&amp;n Flows of Air and Water can be used to create a thick fog, 
useful for confusing pursuit or aerial observation. 


&amp;GEnhance Plant Growth:&amp;n This is the Spirit weave that is used to 
keep the gardens of Tar Valon blooming even in this hideous 
drought. It can be used to make plants flourish in any weather. 
&amp;yJane weaves fine threads of Spirit into the rose. Rapidly, the 
wilting fades away, replaced by a healthy sheen. &amp;n

      <description>&amp;cAccepted Weave List&amp;n

The purpose of this document is to list some more intermediate 
weaves or uses for the One Power that would be likely taught to 
Accepted so that the guild can have standard examples of how 
these should be done. The list is not all inclusive. That would 
likely not be possible. It is a rough guideline of the things an 
Accepted should learn. 

&amp;WR&amp;we&amp;Wf&amp;wr&amp;We&amp;ws&amp;Wh&amp;w:&amp;n This is a spirit weave used to wash away fatigue. The 
subject must be touched, as with all Healing weaves. It is 
dangerous if overused, as it only removes the feeling of fatigue, 
instead of actually replenishing one&apos;s reserves. 
&amp;yJane raises up on her toes and extends her right hand to touch 
Joe on the forehead. She spins a complex web of Spirit which 
she then passes through his body, causing all signs of his 
exhaustion to vanish. &amp;n

&amp;WH&amp;Ce&amp;Wa&amp;Cl&amp;Wi&amp;Cn&amp;Wg&amp;C:&amp;n This is a complex web of Water, Spirit and Air. It is 
woven into a gauze-like weave that is passed through the 
patient&apos;s body. Once this weave is learned, one&apos;s ability with it is 
determined purely by her talent for Healing. The talent is a 
sliding scale, ranging from those who can only heal bruises to 
those who are able to fan the slightest spark of life back to full 
health. Although the talent seems to have a wide range, the 
effects of the weave are more of a toggle switch than a scale. If 
the patient&apos;s wounds are within the ability of the channeler to 
Heal, then the patient is fully healed by the weave. If the wound 
is beyond the channeler&apos;s ability, the patient is not healed at all. 
The wound in Rand&apos;s side is an exception to this rule. This is 
such an exception that it has visibly shocked every Aes Sedai to 
encounter it, even through their fabled serenity. Unless the 
slight delay would risk the patient&apos;s life, it is a good idea to Delve 
him or her first. There are more details in the description of the 
Delve weave below. 
&amp;yJane grasps Joe&apos;s head firmly in her hands. She channels flows 
of Air, Water and Spirit, weaving them into a complex, gauze-
like structure which she moves throughout his body. As the 
weave passes through him, the flesh behind it writhes as the 
wounds knit closed. &amp;n

&amp;WDelve&amp;n: Thin probing flows of Spirit are used to search through a 
patient and diagnose any injuries. It is generally better to delve 
the subject before Healing to determine the extent of the injuries 
so that the weave may be better directed or even to determine if 
the injuries are within the abilities of the channeler to Heal. After 
emoting the delve weave, it is a good idea to discuss the injury 
with the patient OOCly through tells, or some other channel, and 
negotiate the success or failure of the subsequent Healing 
weave. 
&amp;yJane probes throughout the patient&apos;s body with fine threads of 
Spirit, grimly assessing the extent of his injuries. &amp;n

&amp;yOpen Lock:&amp;n Threads of Earth are used to manipulate the 
mechanisms in a lock and cause it to open. 
&amp;yJane grasps the padlock in her right hand, brow furrowing in 
concentration as she weaves thin threads of Earth into it. After a 
moment, she smiles in satisfaction and gives the lock a tug. Her 
smile widens slightly as it pops open. &amp;n

      <description>&amp;WTrollocs:&amp;n About 8-10 feet tall, these creatures combine elements 
of man and animal. They have the heads of various types of 
animals and birds, and some have hoofed feet as well. They 
use crude weapons and can be killed by a trained swordsman or 
by the One Power. They are generally both stupid and cowardly, 
and they usually need a smarter and stronger leader to keep 
them in line and force them into action. This leader is frequently 
a Myrddraal. 
&amp;WMyrddraal: &amp;nAlso known as Halfmen, the Eyeless, Fades, Lurks, 
Shadowmen, or Fetches, all Fades look the same. They are 
taller than the average man, with pasty white skin and no eyes. 
They dress all in black. Their clothing does not move in the 
wind. They can feel use of the One Power. Their main weapon 
is a black sword that has been forged in Thakandar. Wounds 
from these blades do not heal properly. Without the help of a 
talented Healer the wounded certainly die. Myrddraal are difficult 
to kill with steel and may require the use of the One Power, but 
they will not cross running water by choice. Fades have no 
reflection other than a misty form. Their gaze causes physical 
fear in a person. They often link with their patrol of Trollocs and 
use that link to direct and force them into action. The best way 
to defeat a patrol of Trollocs is to find the Myrrdraal in command 
and kill it. This will kill or disable all the trollocs linked to that 
fade. A Fade will not die instantly and can thrash for hours after 
it&apos;s death. They do not die completely until the setting of the sun. 
There is some uncertainty over a skill by which they can fade 
into and out of shadows. 
&amp;WDraghkar:&amp;n These large winged, flying creatures are frequently 
used as assassins and scouts for the Dark. They are not very 
intelligent and do not fight well. Their main attack is to use a 
song that entices their victims to come closer as if in a daze. 
Once the victim is in range, the Draghkar gives them a kiss. 
This kiss drains the soul and then life. Those who have been 
rescued once the kiss has begun would have been better off 
dead. 
&amp;WDarkhounds:&amp;n These hounds are as large as ponies and 
frequently used to track specific victims. They have the usual 
abilities of dogs, and can be confused by some of the same 
tricks such as crossing water. They travel in packs of 8-10, and 
are the source of legends of the Wild Hunt. Their paws do not 
leave prints in dirt or mud although they can melt pawprints into 
stone. There is a scent of sulfur about them which can alert one 
to their presence and their saliva is an immensly corrosive and 
powerful poison. In recent times a new breed of Darkhound has 
been reported abroad in thw world, one that apparently can be 
slain only with the One Power. Stories tell of the beasts being 
cut to pieces with power-wrought weapons only to have their 
hacked parts melt and reform into whole, living hounds: 
&amp;WGrey Men:&amp;n Once human, these assassins gave up their souls to 
the Dark One in exchange for the ability to pass unnoticed by 
even the most alert guards. Their appearance is so ordinary that 
the mind simply doesn&apos;t register their presence, but once 
discovered they can be killed in the same way as any other 
shadowspawn. 
&amp;WRats and Ravens:&amp;n Often spies for the dark one. One of the good 
things about having an Aes Sedai stay at an Inn is that she will 
often rid the place of vermin. 

While not being related to the Dark One or shadowspawn 
directly, the following sections concern things known to be 
similarly evil -

      <description>&amp;cLectures:&amp;n
The student should read the following lectures or have them 
taught to her. It is not really important if the teaching is done as 
roleplay or explained OOCly. The important part is that the 
student absorb the material. 
Accepted rules --- &amp;c&amp;caccrules&amp;n&amp;n

The Forsaken --- &amp;cforsaken&amp;n

&amp;cChanneling:&amp;n
The student should read and become familiar with the material 
in the Readings section. If there is any part with which she has 
trouble, she should request to have the lessons taught to her. A 
student should also feel free to ask a higher ranking member for 
clarification on anything she does not understand.

The student should have the following lessons taught to her. 
&amp;cNature of the Bond &amp;n
&amp;cCombat Channeling &amp;n

&amp;cOOC Test:&amp;n First the student will be tested in an out of character 
interview. She will be required to show competence with 
emoting the weaves covered in the earlier section, as well as 
being required to answer technical questions about them. She 
will also be responsible for either knowing the material in the 
lectures or at least being able to reference it quickly enough to 
answer questions or form emotes based on questions about 
them. Anything covered in the syllabus is fair game for 
questions. If the student does not pass, she will have to wait 
one real life week before she may request to be tested again. 
During this time, she is free to request that any of the earlier 
lessons be retaught to her. This will be a very stringent test. The 
reason is that Aes Sedai should meet high standards. There are 
also many lessons that are not learned until after one attains the 
shawl. Since there are no tests after being raised to the shawl, it 
must be made certain that those who pass to that point do not 
need further testing.

&amp;cIC Test:&amp;n Next, if the student passes the OOC test, she will be 
required to roleplay her taking of the Three Oaths oaths.html 
on the Oath Rod. After being raised, she may opt to roleplay out 
the seeking of her Ajah. This is not required, and in many cases 
may not be possible due to inactivity of the particular Ajah. 

If the student fails either test, she will have to wait one real 
week before she may request to be tested again. As with the 
Novice Syllabus, she may use this week to retake any of the 
lessons she wishes. If she passes, she will be raised to Aes 
Sedai with all the appropriate changes in guild equipment and 
guild skills associated.

      <description>&amp;cDetecting Female Channelers&amp;n

As the student&apos;s ability with the One Power grows, she will 
gradually reach a point where she is able to sense the same 
ability within other women. This ability would not likely show up 
until the student is fully competent with embracing and releasing 
the One Power. In game terms, a student is set with the code 
skill for this, test, when she is raised to Accepted. 

It is easier to sense the ability in one who is trained. It is also 
possible to gain a rough idea of the person&apos;s strength in the One 
Power relative to one&apos;s own. For those who are untrained, it is 
possible to get an idea of their potential strength. One can also 
tell if the young girl is teachable or if she has the spark inborn. 
The books never discuss exactly how this is done. They can just 
tell. 

This is not a very long range ability. If a woman is not holding 
the Power, another woman would not be able to sense the 
ability in her at more than five or six feet(approx. two meters) 
away. If one is not paying close attention, it is difficult to tell at 
more than arm&apos;s length. 

Use of the One Power can be sensed much further away, 
depending on how much is used. Since women trained in the 
use of Saidar can see a glow around other women who are 
holding the Power, then she would be able to notice another 
woman in her line of sight channeling as far away as she could 
see her. If line of sight is not possible, the exact range of 
detection is harder to determine. As a rough guide, if someone 
is channeling in a building the size of an inn, and the amount 
channeled is not purposely miniscule, another woman trained in 
channeling should be able to detect it.

      <description>&amp;yEarth (masculine/passive) - &amp;n
Earth is used for manipulating solids. It is passive, forming a 
foundation for other flows to build upon or react with. It controls 
cohesion, being used to reinforce and strengthen or to weaken 
and crumble. 
&amp;RFire&amp;n -- Dealt with in the fire discussion. 
&amp;WAir&amp;n -- Dealt with in the air discussion. 
&amp;CWater&amp;n -- These flows are complimentary, much as fire and air 
are. One is masculine and the other feminine, causing them to 
mesh well, while they are both passive which causes no 
conflicts. 
&amp;WSpirit&amp;n -- Various results. 

&amp;CWater (feminine/passive) - &amp;n

Much like earth, water controls cohesion, providing or 
undermining the structure of a weave. Because of the feminine 
nature, it is more likely to provide support than to be used 
destructively. It is also used to manipulate liquids. 

The way water reacts with the other flows has already been 
addressed in the sections for those various flows, with the 
exception of Spirit, which reacts in various different ways 
depending on how it is used and what is needed. 


&amp;WS&amp;wp&amp;Wi&amp;wr&amp;Wi&amp;wt &amp;W-&amp;n  

Spirit is neither masculine nor feminine. It can active passively 
or actively or even neutrally. It can act as a catalyst to increase 
the effects of other flows, or it can dampen them. Its realm is life 
energy and things dealing with the one power itself. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="flowtheory">
      <description>&amp;cFlow Theory&amp;n

The purpose of this presentation is to supply the student with a 
knowledge of how the different flows react with each other so 
that the channeler may more easily determine which flows to 
use in each weave. Since Robert Jordan was not consulted in 
this matter, it is all just opinion and speculation. Hopefully, it will 
be usefull to our guild.

Each of the five flows has attributes which determine how it 
reacts with the other flows. Aptitude with Fire and Earth is more 
common in men, so we will refer to these flows as masculine. In 
general, the use of Water and Air come more easily to women. 
We will label these as feminine. Fire and Air are more energetic 
flows, so will be referred to as active. Water and Earth embody 
the passive principle. Spirit is not masculine or feminine. It also 
seems to function in an active or passive role, depending on 
what is needed. 

&amp;RFire (masculine/active) - &amp;n

Fire is used to control heat energy, adding or removing it from a 
weave. Care should be taken when using Fire to remove heat, 
as drawing the energy into one&apos;s self is dangerous and very 
often fatal. It reacts with other flows as follows: 
&amp;WAir&amp;n -- These two flows tend to compliment and strengthen each 
other. Adding the two actives tends to make them even more 
active. The male/female aspects support each other. To burn 
strongly, a fire needs plenty of air. 
&amp;yEarth&amp;n -- The tension and conflict caused by both being male, but 
one active and one passive, can cause explosive reactions if 
twined closely. 
&amp;CWater&amp;n -- These two flows are diametrically opposite. Combining 
them can result in violent, energetic reactions. 
&amp;WSpirit&amp;n -- Combination with spirit can produce various effects. 

&amp;WAir (feminine/active) - &amp;n

Controls wind movements and can be used to manipulate 
objects as if an extra appendage. Where fire is heat energy, Air 
is kinetic energy. Interactions: 
&amp;RFire&amp;n -- Already dealt with under the fire discussion. 
&amp;yEarth&amp;n -- These are complete opposites, like fire and water. They 
react vigorously, although not as violently as would fire and 
water because the active principle in this reaction is feminine. 
&amp;CWater&amp;n -- Both are feminine, which can cause conflict. However, 
they can also support one another. The passive nature of water 
can provide a foundation for strengthening the actions of the air 
element. 
&amp;WSpirit&amp;n -- As always, combination with spirit can produce different 
results depending on how it is used.

      <description>&amp;yShape Stone:&amp;n Flows of Earth can be used to rearrange the 
composition of dirt, metal or stone in order to reshape it. 
Basically, it is sculpting using just the One Power. Size of the 
task affects the difficulty. Bending a sword blade would probably 
not be very hard, especially if you just make the metal soft and 
malleable in one small spot and then use flows of air for the 
actual bending. Rearranging a large boulder into a statue would 
be a good deal more difficult, and the One Power in no way 
guarantees artistic ability. 
&amp;yJane studies the marble plaque, a frown of concentration 
marring her Aes Sedai serenity. She carefully weaves light flows 
of Earth into the stone, gradually smoothing away the 
inscription. In mere moments, Joe&apos;s engraved protestations of 
undying love are no more. &amp;n

&amp;yDelve Ores:&amp;n Probing flows of earth are used to find and identify 
ores in the ground. The ability is very rare in women. 
&amp;yAfter several moments of carefully probing the closed box&apos;s 
contents with threads of Earth, Jane looks up and announces,&apos;It 
contains a piece of coal, a copper farthing and a silver mark.&apos; &amp;n

&amp;CDry:&amp;n Flows of water can be used to move moisture out of hair, 
clothing, etc. This is probably the most common use to which 
simple weaves of Water are put in the books. 
&amp;yJane weaves threads of Water carefully through Joe&apos;s drenched 
clothing, drawing the moisture out and causing it to gather in a 
pool at his feet leaving his fancy, silk coat dry, but ruined. &amp;n

&amp;CMove Water:&amp;n Flows of Water can be used to move liquid 
around. This is useful for gathering up a spill or stirring. 
&amp;yJane channels flows of Water into the puddle, causing it to 
gather up into a quivering ball about the size of her head. 
Gently, she lifts it with a cradling web of Air and slowly moves it 
to the window where she releases it, allowing it to splash onto 
the ground below. &amp;n

&amp;CCreate Water:&amp;n Flows of water can be used to coax moisture 
from the air. The difficulty would be determined by how humid 
the air is and how much water one is attempting to create. This 
would not be terribly easy, even under ideal circumstances. 
&amp;yJane concentrates and forms a web made of tendrils of Water, 
radiating to all corners of the room, but centered over her small 
tea cup. She uses the weave to gradually coax moisture from 
the air of the room, along the weave to the cup. After a few 
moments, droplets of water begin to fall from the center of the 
web into the cup, slowly filling it. &amp;n


&amp;YBall &amp;Wof &amp;YLight:&amp;n Air is used to form the hollow shell or ball. A fine 
thread of Fire is then looped inside the shell to produce the light. 
&amp;yJane holds her hands in front of her about a foot apart with the 
palms facing each other. She spins out a thread of Air and 
weaves it into a mesh-like ball in the middle of the space 
between her hands. Carefully, she inserts a thin filament of Fire 
into the hollow sphere and loops it, pulsing energy along the 
thread causing the entire construct to glow with a soft light. &amp;n

      <description>&amp;cNovice Level Weaves&amp;n
The purpose of this document is to list some simple weaves or 
uses for the One Power that would be likely taught to Novices 
so that the guild can have standard examples of how these 
should be done. The list is not all inclusive. That would likely not 
be possible. It is a rough guideline of the things a Novice should 
learn before being raised to Accepted. 

&amp;WHarden Air:&amp;n Flows of Air used to form a hard surface. This can 
be used for various things. Flows of air tightly woven into a hard 
disc can form a shield to deflect blows. The same type of barrier 
can be expanded out to form a wall. Offensively, hardened air 
can be formed into a club for use as a weapon. &amp;RNote: see the 
three oaths&amp;n. It can also be formed into a switch or whip-like 
construct. 
&amp;yJane channels flows of Air into a tightly spun disc. There is a 
slight shimmering in front of her as the air hardens just in time to 
deflect the incoming stone. &amp;n
&amp;WBind:&amp;n Bands of air can be used to immobilize a target or to hold 
objects in place. Combined with hardened air, it can be used to 
gag, blindfold or stop the ears of a target. 
&amp;yJane channels out thick bands of Air, attempting to loop them 
around Joe and pin his arms to his sides. &amp;n

&amp;WLift:&amp;n This is the most common use for Air. It is similar to bind, 
except that once the target is &quot;grabbed&quot; it is then lifted. Weight 
directly affects difficulty. The heavier the target and the higher it 
is lifted, the more power is required. Lifting a person is difficult, 
although it is doable, especially by someone who is strong 
enough to gate. However, lifting them more than a couple of 
yards would be a herculean task unless the person is small or 
the channeler is of Forsaken caliber strength. 
&amp;yJane wraps flows of Air tightly around the kettle. Slowly and 
carefully, she lifts it from the table, the glow of Saidar around 
her increasing in intensity as she begins to draw more deeply on 
the One Power. &amp;n

&amp;RHeat:&amp;n Thin flows of Fire are woven into an object to heat it. 
Excellent for heating water for tea. 
&amp;yJane channels thin threads of Fire, passing them through the 
kettle slowly and carefully until a thin stream of steam begins to 
rise from the spout. &amp;n

&amp;RFlame:&amp;n A single thread of Fire is looped or twisted at the end to 
concentrate it and produce a visible flame. 
&amp;yJane holds her hands cupped in front of her and channels a 
slender thread of Fire into the hollow formed by her fingers. She 
forms the thread into a loop and gradually increases the 
intensity of the flow until a small flame appears and flickers 
above her palms. &amp;n

&amp;RIgnite:&amp;n A single flow of Fire is inserted into the target, causing 
it to burst into flames. 
&amp;yJane adjusts her shawl more snugly about her shoulders and 
then focuses her attention on the fireplace. The glow of Saidar 
slowly envelopes her as she embraces the True Source. She 
spins out a thin thread of Fire into the heart of the largest piece 
of firewood. The thread thickens as she pours more strength 
into it until, after a moment, the log bursts into flames. &amp;n

&amp;RWarm Room:&amp;n This is a complex web of fine threads of Fire used 
to warm the air. This weave should not be tied off and left 
unattended, lest it get out of hand and start a fire. 
&amp;yJane&apos;s breath is visible in the chill air of her bedchamber as she 
concentrates on spinning out the fine tendrils of Fire until they 
reach all corners of the room. After just a few moments, the 
room is toasty warm. She releases the weave and finally slips 
out from beneath her heavy, down-filled comforter. &amp;n

    <exdesc keyword="gnr2">
      <description>Releasing the One Power is rather simple. One merely lets it go. 
The only difficulty is in wanting to let it go. That will be 
addressed more fully later when dangers of channeling are 
discussed. An example of releasing: 

&amp;yThe golden aura around Jane dims and then goes out as she 
releases Saidar with a soft sigh and a slightly wistful expression 
on her face. &amp;n

Channeling has some inherent dangers. Saidar is addictive. 
Holding the Power fills one with a sense of well-being and 
ecstasy. There is a sweetness to Saidar that causes one to 
want to draw more and more of it. There is a point where the 
pleasure starts to turn to pain. This is the limit of what one can 
safely hold. Drawing any more runs the risk of burning out, 
losing the ability to channel forever, or dying. This same 
sweetness that causes one to want to draw more deeply on 
Saidar also causes one to not want to part from it. If one does 
not gradually build up a tolerance, she could become addicted, 
wanting nothing but to hold Saidar. The extreme stages of this 
addiction lead to headaches, then comas, then death. This 
danger is one of the reasons that novices are not allowed to 
channel except under direct supervision during lessons. 

Channeling while fatigued is dangerous, as well. If tired, a 
channeler can lose control of the Power with results from merely 
losing their grasp to burning out and dying. Channeling while 
tired is further complicated by the fact that channeling is in itself 
a tiring activity, a deceptively tiring one. The rush that one feels 
from holding the Power makes it difficult to notice how much it is 
fatiquing her.

    <exdesc keyword="gnr">
      <description>&amp;cGrasp and Release&amp;n

Grasping and releasing the One Power is something a member 
of the Aes Sedai will do very often. In fact, it will be done so 
often as to become a very trivial part of one&apos;s channeling 
emotes. 

In Robert Jordan&apos;s world, it could take weeks or even months for 
a girl to become competent and embracing the One Power, 
depending on her natural aptitude for it and whether or not she 
had sparked. For most people, roleplaying these weeks or 
months of trying to embrace, but failing, is boring to say the 
least. If someone actually wants to roleplay such things, that is 
her decision. For most, however, this will be part of their 
character&apos;s assumed history. If the play can demonstrate a 
competence with emoting this, it will be assumed that her 
character has spent the necessary time and practice. She may 
request to be tested on this whenever she feels ready. If she 
passes, she will have her grasp and release skills set to 70%. 

In the books, many different relaxation and visualization 
techniques are described for getting into the proper state of 
mind to embrace Saidar. These can be useful if one is actually 
RPing the lesson. However, they will likley never be used 
outside this lesson. Since it is generally accepted that one 
should not put thoughts into one&apos;s emotes, there is little purpose 
to these techniques other than to give one background 
information and perhaps aid in the feel of Jordan&apos;s rich world. 
For the sake of brevity, only the rosebud technique will be 
discussed here. 

The student should visualize herself as a tightly closed rosebud 
with Saidar as the sun. She should imagine turning towards the 
sun and slowly opening her petals to soak in the sunlight, 
allowing Saidar to flow into her. The important concept in this is 
the passivity of the student. Saidar should never be forced. One 
has to surrender herself to Saidar to control it. Women do not 
grasp the one power, they embrace it. They do not force it to 
their bidding, they gently guide it while allowing it to do their 
bidding. This is all useful background material, but difficult to 
use in an emote. An emote should only include those things 
which can be sensed by the audience. The Wheel of Time world 
does not have telepathy, so the audience cannot sense that the 
student is imagining herself as a rosebud. Her facial 
expressions and posture can be seen. Any noises she makes 
can be heard. Other female channelers can feel her channel 
and see a soft golden glow around her when she holds the 
power. The intensity of the glow will increase or decrease with 
the amount of Power she holds. These are things that can be 
included in the emote. An example: 

&amp;yJane takes a deep breath. As she slowly releases it, her face 
takes on a serene expression, muscles relaxing and smoothing. 
For those women present who can channel, a soft, golden 
nimbus surrounds her as she is slowly filled with Saidar. &amp;n

      <description>&amp;cThe Three Oaths&amp;n

All Aes Sedai swear the three Oaths on the Oath Rod when 
they are raised to the shawl. As the Oaths are spoken there is 
said to be a feeling of the oaths &quot;settling&quot; into the Sedai and a 
tightening of the skin, along with a mild burning sensation. 
Rebel Aes Sedai raised since the split in the Tower do not hold 
the Rod when they swear, although they do still take the Oaths. 
They should still strive to live by them, as should Novices and 
Accepted. 

The Oaths:
To speak no word that is not true. 
To make no weapon for one man to kill another. 
Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against 
Darkfriends or Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of 
defending her own life, that of her Warder, or that of another 
Sister. 


The most important thing about the Oaths is why they are 
sworn. Each has a specific reason. By swearing to tell only the 
truth, Aes Sedai prove that they can be trusted, that if they 
make a promise, they will keep it. Aes Sedai have the ability to 
craft or enhance objects with the One Power. By swearing the 
second oath they reassure the rest of the nations that they will 
never be involved in the raising of armies or the propagation of 
war. An army of soldiers whose swords cannot be broken and 
shields would never dent would be at a massive advantage. The 
third oath assures the nations that the Aes Sedai are not an 
aggressive power. With the Power that broke the world at their 
beck and call, they would be unstoppable should they decide to 
expand their control. 

All women being trained to become Aes Sedai are expected to 
live as if they have already sworn these oaths, regardless of 
whether or not they are in the White Tower. In the White Tower 
a woman swears before the Amyrlin on the day she is raised the 
the shawl. In Salidar it is much the same, although the Oath 
Rod isn&apos;t present. 

On a practical note, one who sworn the Oaths on the Oath Rod 
is completely incapable of breaking them. The Oath Rod binds 
her to her word. However, there are ways to deceive without 
technically lying. For example: 
&amp;yJane gives the servant a level stare, then introduces calmly, 
&quot;You may address me as Lady Sara. Please tell your lord I wish 
to speak with him as soon as it&apos;s convenient.&quot; &amp;n

Note that she did not say that her name is Sara, merely that the 
servant could call her Sara.

      <description>However, these men, who had so recently been the strongest 
influences across worlds soon left the Ogier sanctuaries, unable 
to resist the call of the power and the need to channel it. The 
Nym, whose bodies were made of bark and leaf and who were 
brothers to the Ogier, slowly began to die out, their immortality 
gone at the end of the war. Only one of the Nym would survive 
the cataclysm, his task to guard a pure pool of Saidin known as 
the Eye of the World. The Aiel, (&quot;dedicated&quot; in the Old Tongue) 
once the servants of the Aes Sedai, pledged to peace, fled with 
the treasures of the Aes Sedai - objects given into Aiel trust for 
safe keeping, while the world broke around them. 

The death of Lews Therin Telamon came early in the Breaking. 
In his death throes he called down a mighty blast of power to 
smite himself where he stood on an endless rolling field of 
grassland. A great black mountain was created where he struck, 
the ground heaving it into existence, a mountain that would cast 
a shadow across a river and over an island that would be where 
the Aes Sedai began again. This mountain would be called 
Dragonmount, the place of the Dragon&apos;s rebirth, while the island 
would be named Tar Valon, the tower that guards, awaiting his 
coming. 

In the years that followed the White Tower of Tar Valon was 
formed, built by Elisane Tishar, first Amyrlin Seat. The influence 
of the Aes Sedai grew until few nations rulers were without Aes 
Sedai advisors, greatly due to the fact that all Aes Sedai now 
swore three oaths - to speak no word that is not true, to make 
no weapon for one man to kill another, and to use the One 
Power as a weapon against only Shadowspawn, or in the last 
defense of her life, the life of her Warder, or that of another Aes 
Sedai. These oaths were binding, and one who had sworn could 
NOT break them. 

The purpose of the Aes Sedai now is much the same as it was 
in the past - as a Servant of All. They are healers and guides, 
advisors kings and queens, keepers of lost knowledge, and 
each Ajah within the Tower has its own specific purpose.

    <exdesc keyword="history2">
      <description>Unfortunately, not even these new weapons were able to stop 
the advance of the Shadow, and city after city, country after 
country fell into darkness and despair. During the last two years 
of conflict Lews Therin proposed to the rest of the Aes Sedai 
that they pool their strength, to strike one massive blow at the 
heart of the conflict, the bore at Shayol Ghul. This plan 
managed to split the Hall of Servants into two armed camps, the 
supporters of Lews Therin, mostly consisting of men, while the 
others who argued that they should continue fighting as they 
had done before. 

Finally, Lews Therin decided to end The War of Power by his 
own means, without permission from the Hall. His band of Aes 
Sedai, now called the Hundred Companions, as well as a group 
of 10,000 military men, struck at the heart of the Shadow. As it 
happened all thirteen forsaken were at the bore holding a 
council of some sort. Lews Therin&apos;s attack caught them 
completely off-guard and before the forsaken could strike they 
were bound and sealed when Lews Therin and his Hundred 
Companions sealed the Bore on the prison. 

The ramifications of Lews Therin&apos;s actions would be immediately 
felt, as all who struck and sealed the Dark One were grabbed 
and smashed by the Dark One&apos;s counter-stroke. Instead of 
striking at the Aes Sedai themselves the Great Lord of the Dark 
tainted the male half of the True Source, effectively placing a 
curse upon the male Aes Sedai of madness and a death from 
rot. All the male channelers at the sealing went instantly insane 
turning what was a glorious victory into nothing but ashes. 

The consequences of the counter-stroke affected all male 
channelers, driving some immediately mad while others 
managed to handle the taint for a few years. Before the male 
Aes Sedai could die they smashed all around them, smashing 
whole cities and destroying miles of land around themselves in 
obliterating blasts of power. Then, what is now called the 
Breaking of the World began, for the very foundations upon 
which the world stood were changed, and this change was 
sudden, violent, and deadly. 

As the world began to break apart the people began to scatter 
to all ends of the planet in vain attempts to find shelter and 
peace, Lews Therin, fully wrapped in madness, returned to his 
home and began to destroy all around him, killing his wife, 
children, and all his friends who had been there through the war. 
Ever after this day he would be known as the Kinslayer, the man 
who broke the world, the Dragon of prophecy. The war was 
over, ten years of bloody, horrific, bitter struggle, completed and 
won for the Light, but the cost was tremendous. 

The Age of Legends would end in the following years, the 
glories and marvels of countless generations vanishing like a 
mirage as knowledge and technology disappeared - the lands 
began to shatter and people and hope began to die. The Ogier, 
the gentle giants that were only humanoid in shape but long 
lived unlike humans - allies of the Light throughout the war - 
vanished into their Steddings, peaceful abodes that offered 
protection from the madness and chaos of the outside world. 
Many male Aes Sedai went with the Ogier, the Steddings 
blocking the ability to channel, and these accursed men were 
able to live awhile without fear of a rotting death.

      <description>&amp;cThe History of the Aes Sedai&amp;n

The Age of Legends was a time of miracles, when all things 
were possible and both men and women served as Aes Sedai 
(&quot;Servant of All&quot; in the Old Tongue). During this prosperous age, 
one of the most powerful Aes Sedai was born and came to 
prominence; his name was Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon. 
He was unique beyond being Aes Sedai, for he was a Ta&apos;veren. 

The easiest method of describing Ta&apos;veren is to say that they 
are a focal point for the pattern. They often have no control over 
this and have even less control over their own actions than 
those who aren&apos;t Ta&apos;veren, and they can often appear to be very 
lucky in that things seem to go their way. It&apos;s not just that they 
are simply lucky, it&apos;s that the pattern forces events such that the 
Ta&apos;veren ends up where the pattern needs him. 

It is not known how long Lews Therin led the Aes Sedai before 
destruction occurred, but as Aes Sedai led lives more than 500 
years long it could be any significant amount of time. He ruled 
and the land prospered until a group of slighted Aes Sedai 
began to uproot some secrets that would affect all time - chiefly 
among these secrets was the existence of a power, equal in 
strength to the Creator, known as Shai&apos;tan, or the Great Lord of 
the Dark. This divinity had been sealed in a prison at the 
moment of creation, destined to lead an existence cut off from 
the world, with no influence or control. 

The event that was to begin the conflict between the forces of 
good and evil was the bore, the hole drilled by Lanfear and 
another Forsaken into the prison of the Dark One. This action 
caused the war to begin immediately for although Shai&apos;tan was 
still constrained in the prison his hand could reach out and affect 
the world. Lews Therin rallied the forces of the Light, it&apos;s 
backbone the Aes Sedai and it&apos;s regular troops as newly trained 
soldiers. No violent crime had been committed for a long period 
of time before the war, thus the need for troops was non-
existent, putting the Light at a distinct disadvantage at the 
beginning of the war. 

The Forsaken began to construct their own army, using powers 
from the Dark One and their own twisted skill, to form creatures 
of nightmarish aspect. Chiefly among these experiments were 
Trollocs, Myrddraal, Draghkar, Darkhounds, and Gray men. 
(see later lectures). 

The war began, the Light with the Aes Sedai and soldiers drawn 
from the land against the Shadow with all it&apos;s twisted evil. The 
war lasted a bloody ten years, desperate battle fought after 
desperate battle, the Light losing almost every confrontation. 
Slowly the Aes Sedai began to understand the full implications 
of their dilemma, and they began to construct objects of the 
power to aid them in their struggle. Known as Angreal, 
Ter&apos;angreal and Sa&apos;angreal, these objects allowed the wielder to 
draw more of the One Power, greatly increasing the wielder&apos;s 
effectiveness. They can generally be used by either a man or a 
woman but not both. Sa&apos;ngreal are stronger versions of angreal, 
and are less common. Both of these require that the channeler 
touch them while channeling, and they will allow the channeler 
to draw much more of the Source than they could otherwise. 
Ter&apos;angreal are made for a specific purpose, such as putting 
someone to sleep. There are many more ter&apos;angreal than the 
other two. Some of them can be used by men, some by women, 
some by either, and some do not require an ability to channel at 
all. The use and function of most ter&apos;angreal is unknown, and it 
can be extremely dangerous to experiment with these 
unknowns. Note - *angreals were made before the war, just far 
far less often, and with less intent to do harm.

      <description>&amp;cThe Amyrlin Seat&amp;n
The woman chosen to lead the White Tower is the Amyrlin 
Seat. She is not always the strongest Aes Sedai. The politics of 
the Hall of the Tower can play a very large role in determining 
who becomes Amyrlin. She is also known by the titles Watcher 
of the Seals(although they aren&apos;t currently in the Tower) and 
Keeper of the Flame. She is at least the equal of kings and 
queens. Any ruler would come to Tar Valon if requested by the 
Amyrlin Seat. The Amyrlin Seat herself is a member of all the 
Ajahs, while at the same time a member of none. She is to 
represent all their interests, holding no Ajah above any other. 
The Amrylin should be addressed as &quot;Mother&quot;. The current 
Amyrlin of the White Tower is Elaida a&apos;Roihan, raised from the 
Red Ajah. The current Amyrlin in Salidar is Egwene al&apos;Vere, 
raised from no Ajah. She was raised to Amyrlin while an 
Accepted. 
&amp;cThe Keeper of the Chronicles&amp;n
The Keeper of the Chronicles is second in power to only the 
Amyrlin. The Keeper serves as the Amyrlin&apos;s secretary, and 
speaks only for the Amyrlin Seat. Traditionally the Keeper 
comes from the same Ajah as the Amyrlin Seat but currently this 
isn&apos;t true. The Keeper in the White Tower is Alviarin Freidhen of 
the White Ajah.
&amp;c(Ajah Heads)&amp;n
The Head of an Ajah is a secret known only to those Aes Sedai 
within that Ajah. As leader of the Ajah, she technically outranks 
the other members. However, in public she would normally 
follow the same seniority rules as other Sisters in order to help 
conceal her identity from those outside the Ajah. Often, the 
Head will be a Sitter, but this is not always the case. 
&amp;cSitters&amp;n
Sitters are those Aes Sedai who sit in the Hall of the Tower and 
cast their votes in debates and issues facing the White Tower. 
There are usually 3 Sitters from each Ajah. A Sitter is normally 
deferred to by other Sisters. 
&amp;cMistress of Novices&amp;n
The Mistress of Novices is the Aes Sedai in charge of all 
aspects of Novice and Accepted life - their rota of chores and 
lessons, their rooms, and any punishments that need given. She 
keeps track of their behavior and progression through their 
lessons. The current Mistress of Novices in the White Tower is 
Jaiana Di&apos;ovranni-Alai Aneiya Riordan, of the Yellow Ajah.
&amp;cAes Sedai&amp;n
Aes Sedai are those women who have been raised to the shawl. 
They wear a shawl embroidered with the flame of Tar Valon, 
fringed in the color that represents their chosen Ajah, and the 
Great Serpent ring on the finger of their choice. They should be 
addressed as &quot;Aes Sedai&quot; by Novices, and &quot; Sedai&quot; by 
Accepted. Seniority is determined amongst the Sedai by a 
number of factors, such as strength in the One Power, how long 
the Sister was a Novice and how long she was an Accepted. 
&amp;cAccepted&amp;n
Accepted are those who have passed the testing in the ring 
Ter&apos;angreal, and are a step closer to becoming Aes Sedai. They 
wear simple dresses of white banded in the seven colors of the 
Ajahs, and the Great Serpent ring on the third finger of their left 
hand. Their time is spent more in study, and they have more 
control over their own studies and movements than do Novices. 
NOTE: Accepted of the White Tower no longer have a blue 
stripe on their dresses, as all symbols of the Blue Ajah have 
been eliminated from the Tower. Rebel Accepted do not pass 
through the testing ter&apos;angreal, as the rebels do not have access 
to it.
&amp;cNovices&amp;n
Novices are those who wish to train to become Aes Sedai. They 
wear simple dresses of white and are aren&apos;t allowed to wear 
jewellery of any kind or have weapons. They spend almost 
every hour of the day working, either doing chores -washing 
clothes in the laundry, scrubbing pots/preparing meals in the 
kitchen, sweeping the garden paths- or in lessons/studying. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="novrules">
      <description>&amp;cNovice Rules, Behavior and Etiquette&amp;n

Novices should curtsey to all Aes Sedai and Accepted, and be 
respectful at all times. This includes never interrupting when an 
Aes Sedai or Accepted is speaking, never turning away if they 
are being spoken to, and answering all questions straight away 
and truthfully. They can leave only when dismissed. 

Novices should use common sense and discretion when 
dealing with males of any rank. Chatting about the weather in a 
public place is perfectly acceptable. Canoodling in a private 
corner of the garden is not. 

A novice must never grasp Saidar without permission or 
supervision by an Aes Sedai or Accepted. 

Novices must never leave the Tower grounds without 
permission. 

There are other things that a novice will learn through time 
about both her attitude and behaviour. Before being raised to 
Accepted novices should know about composure, for example 
not looking at the ground constantly, acting with a little grace 
and decorum, having good table manners and neatness of 
appearance. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="novice">
      <description>&amp;wLectures
The student should read the following lectures or have them 
taught to her. It is not really important if the teaching is done as 
roleplay or explained OOCly. The important part is that the 
student absorb the material. 

Lectures: 
Novice rules --- read &amp;cnovrules&amp;n
Hierarchy --- read &amp;chierarchy&amp;n
History --- read &amp;chistory&amp;n
The Three Oaths --- read &amp;coaths&amp;n
Basic Old Tongue --- read &amp;cotongue&amp;n

Channeling:
The student should read and become familiar with the material 
in the Readings section. If there is any part with which she has 
trouble, she should request to have the lessons taught to her. A 
student should also feel free to ask a higher ranking member for 
clarification on anything she does not understand. 

Readings: 
Embracing and releasing --- read &amp;cgnr&amp;n
Simple weaves --- read &amp;c&amp;cnovweaves&amp;n&amp;n
Flow Interaction Theory --- read &amp;ctheory&amp;n
Detecting the ability to channel --- read &amp;ctest&amp;n

The student should have the following lessons taught to her. 
Technically, they can be taught by anyone of Accepted rank or 
higher. In practice, a student who is new to the concept of 
channeling roleplay would be better served to be taught the 
lesson by one of the more experienced members of the guild. 

Lessons: 
&amp;cBasic Weave Improvisation&amp;n
&amp;cAdvanced Emote Channeling&amp;n

Tests:
OOC Test: First the student will be tested in an out of character 
interview. She will be required to show competence with 
emoting the weaves covered in the earlier section, as well as 
being required to answer technical questions about them. She 
will also be responsible for either knowing the material in the 
lectures or at least being able to reference it quickly enough to 
answer questions or form emotes based on questions about 
them. Anything covered in the syllabus is fair game for 
questions. If the student does not pass, she will have to wait 
one real life week before she may request to be tested again. 
During this time, she is free to request that any of the earlier 
lessons be retaught to her. 

IC White Tower Test: If the student passes the OOC test, she 
will be required to roleplay her trip through the testing 
ter&apos;angreal. 

If the student fails the roleplayed test, she will be sent out of the 
Tower, as per the series. Considering the negotiated roleplay 
situation of the test, it is unlikely that someone will make it to the 
test and fail unintentionally. If she passes, which is the most 
likely result, she will be raised to Accepted with all the 
appropriate changes in guild equipment. Codewise, she will 
have her grasp and release skills set to 100, gain the test gskill 
at 100 and the stormshield gskill at 80.
