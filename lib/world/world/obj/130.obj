These are subranks that denote IC training, not IC rank or authority.
One would need to be at least Skilled subrank to become Dedicated or
Asha'man, although it should be exceedingly rare for an Asha'man to
not be of Fully Trained subrank. 

Failing any test on this syllabus requires a 2 day wait before
retesting.

There are no actual lessons in this subrank. The student should
read the following files and then request to be tested once he
feels he is familiar with the material. The test may be given by
anyone of trained subrank or better and it basically just requires
the student to demonstrate that he has grasped the material
presented in this subrank and that he is able to emote grasping
and releasing Saidin and entering and leaving the void.

&amp;GPURPOSE&amp;n

The Black Tower exists to provide training to those that wish to
channel in the service of the Lord Dragon. The training is harsh
and rigorous with emphasis placed on results instead of intentions
The training walks the edge of safety, pushing hard. Occasionally men
burn out or die from being pushed too hard or fast. This is the major
risk of this method. The benefit is that in just a few months time the
Black Tower has become a force to be reckoned with. 

The M'hael, Mazrim Taim, is the ultimate authority on the farm, having
been given that position by the Lord Dragon, himself. In the old 
tongue, M'hael is a word that simply means leader. His word is law and
can only be countermanded by the Lord Dragon. Second to the M'hael on
the farm is the Tsorovan'm'hael, or Storm Leader. Next comes the
Baijain'm'hael, which means Attack Leader. After this, in descending
order of rank are Asha'man, Dedicated and Soldiers. 

Regardless of rank, everyone trains every day. To increase the speed
with which one gains facility with the One Power, it is used for
everything. All chores are done using the Power. In fact, a recruit
will not be allowed a hot meal until he learns to use the Power to heat
it. In addition, time will be spent each day practicing with the sword
and with hand to hand fighting techniques. The ultimate goal of this
training is to produce finely honed weapons for the Lord Dragon to use
in his fight against the Shadow.

&amp;GVOID&amp;n

Channeling Saidin requires much concentration. It is a constant
struggle requiring the wielder to remain focused. The flame and the
void is a technique for maintaining concentration and avoiding
distractions. It is almost a necessity for controlling Saidin.

In order to form the Void, one concentrates on imagining a flame in his
mind. He then concentrates on feeding his stray thoughts and emotions
into this flame until nothing is left but a void. This is difficult at
first, but with practice the void can be formed almost instantly. Some
of the effects of being in the void are the ability to avoid pain and
other distractions as well as a distinctive emotionless quality. When
someone is in the void, his voice will tend to be cold and flat,
although it is possible to overcome this with enough practice.

For some, the void can be a difficult thing to RP. It is generally
accepted on Fang that one should not put his thoughts and emotions into
his emotes. Since the flame and the void is purely a mental trick, this
presents some problems in RP. It is generally considered best to just
roleplay the effects of being in the void. Some examples:

&amp;cJoe's face goes slack and his eyes cold as he assumes the void. His
voice comes out cold and flat as he says,&quot;Seize Saidin, Dedicated.&quot;&amp;n

&amp;cJoe's face, blank from the void, does not register any sign of pain as
the sword tip sinks deeply into his thigh.&amp;n

An example of how not to do it:

&amp;cJoe forms an image of a bright flame in his mind and slowly feeds his
emotions and stray thoughts into it. An expression of calm gradually
comes over his face as the flame burns away all distractions, then
fades away leaving only the empty void.&amp;n

The previous example is not necessarily a bad emote. It just goes
against the commonly accepted standards for RP on fang. It is generally
accepted that one should not describe his thoughts, since the audience
has no way of knowing these things.

The examples of the right way are not necessarily perfect, either. Each
student should develope his own style that he is comfortable with. The
important things to portray is that one usually appears emotionless
when in the void and that he is able to ignore pain and other
distractions while still being aware of them.

    <exdesc keyword="grasp">
      <description>
&amp;GGRASP&amp;n

Grasping and releasing the One Power is something a member of the Black
Tower will do very often. In fact, it will be done so often as to
become a very trivial part of your channeling emotes.

Once inside the void, one will notice a sort of shimmering or shining
just outside the void. This is Saidin. In order to grasp, one merely
reaches out with his mind and &quot;seizes&quot; this shining. Channeling Saidin
is a constant struggle. If one does not maintain control over it at all
times, he can find himself burned out or even killed. Saidin is not
very forgiving. This constant struggle to control the Power is one of
the reasons that it is incredibly dangerous to channel when fatigued.
This danger is further exacerbated by the fact that channeling itself
tends to fatigue one. It should be further noted that the taint lies
on Saidin like a foul oilslick. Each time one touches Saidin, he also
touches the taint. An example:

&amp;cJoe seizes Saidin, his mouth twisting slightly at the foulness of the
taint.&amp;n

There are many differences between the way a man channels and the way a
woman channels. We will only touch upon a few of them here. Whereas
women that channel can sense the ability in other women, a man can
only sense the ability in another man if that man is actually holding
the power. It takes a test to determine whether or not a man has the
ability to channel and this test requires his cooperation.
Additionally, female channelers will see a glow around another woman
that is holding the Power. Men are not surrounded by a glow when they
channel. Other male channelers will &quot;feel&quot; when a man is holding the
power, but they will not see it, although they will see his weaves
when he channels. A male channeler can tell how much of the power
another man is holding by how strongly he senses it. One similarity
between Saidin and Saidar is the sweetness, the addictive quality.
Even through the foulness of the taint, the feeling of vitality and
joy associated with wielding Saidin is so strong that one is usually
loathe to release it.

&amp;cJoe holds onto Saidin. A feeling of menace rolls off him in waves
sensed only by other men that can channel and grows stronger as he
pulls more of the One Power into himself.&amp;n

In order to release the One Power, a man must force it away from
himself, as if pushing it. This is as much a struggle as grasping to
start with. Strangely, the Power can slip from one's grasp
accidentally. It requires effort to keep grasping as well as effort to
release in a controlled manner. Losing one's grasp accidentally
carries a slight risk of burning out. An example:

&amp;cWith effort, Joe pushes Saidin away from himself, the aura of menace
around him fading as the Power leaves him.&amp;n

&amp;GFIVE&amp;n

The five threads or powers of Saidin are Fire, Earth, Spirit, Water and
Air. This lesson is just a very brief introduction to these five
threads with a little information on the uses of each. They will be
covered more fully later.

Fire controls heat and light energy. It is one of the threads in which
men are more likely to have strength. 

Earth controls cohesion and movement in solids. It is another thread
that men are likely to have a knack for. 

Spirit deals directly with aspects of the One Power and the fabric of
reality. Men and women are supposedly equally likely to have facility
with Spirit. 

Water controls cohesion and manipulation of liquids. Women are more
likely to have Water as their strength.

Air controls kinetic energy and wind movement. Women are more likely to
have Air as their strength.

If a student does not feel he fully grasps the material just from
reading it, he may request to be taught it.
Once these things are completed, the student is ready to be tested.
Anyone of Trained subrank or higher may give the test. The student
must demonstrate a good grasp of the material in the syllabus in
theory and in use. If the student needs more practice, he will not be
promoted. If the student does not pass, he may try again in two days
(real time). If the student does pass and is promoted, his grasp and
release will be set to 90. He will also gain Shield of Saidin at 80 and
Test at 100.

&amp;GTHEORY&amp;n

This is among the most involved lessons on the syllabus, and is one of
the most important. It will set the tone for the recipient's channeler
training for the rest of the time they are in the guild. This
information was taken from the old syllabus to promote consistency.
The lecture is divided into two parts: Flow Comparison, and Flow
Theory.

&amp;WFlow Comparison:&amp;n

&amp;RFire&amp;n/&amp;CAir&amp;n - common for masculine/ common for feminine, both are
embodiments of the active principle. 
&amp;yEarth&amp;n/&amp;BWater&amp;n - masculine/feminine, these embody the passive
principle. 
&amp;WSpirit&amp;n - neither masculine nor feminine, this flow is capable of
taking an active, passive, or static role depending on its usage in a
weaving.

Each of the five flows has attributes which determine how it reacts
with the other flows. Aptitude with &amp;RFire&amp;n and &amp;yEarth&amp;n is more common in
men, so we will refer to these flows as masculine. In general, the use
of &amp;BWater&amp;n and &amp;CAir&amp;n come more easily to women. We will label these as
feminine. &amp;RFire&amp;n and &amp;CAir&amp;n are more energetic flows, so will be referred
to as active. They add the energy, be it heat, light or kinetic, to
the weave. &amp;BWater&amp;n and &amp;yEarth&amp;n embody the passive principle. They provide
the structure, cohesiveness and solidity. &amp;WSpirit&amp;n is not masculine or
feminine. It also seems to function in an active or passive role,
depending on what is needed. It also seems to function as a catalyst
or dampener for the effects of other flows.

&amp;WFlow Theory:&amp;n

&amp;RFire&amp;n - controls heat flow, and interacts with other flows as follows:

[&amp;CAir&amp;n] strengthens and adds to the active nature of the flow as outlined
in the comparison section. The two flows are complementary. Fire can't
burn strongly without air. See applications elsewhere, in fireball
lesson. 
[&amp;yEarth&amp;n] produces tension/conflict when twined closely, becoming
volatile and potentially explosive or destructive. This is because
both of them are masculine, but one is passive and one is active.
Therefore conflict and heat are the result. 
[&amp;BWater&amp;n] produces tension/conflict, potentially resulting in possible
explosion or destruction. Once again, the conflict results from the
dichotomy between active and passive, with a different twist
originating from the presence of a male/female separation as well. 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] varying effects, depending on the weaving being attempted and
the flows present. 

&amp;CAir&amp;n - controls wind movements, can be used to manipulate things
physically with great ease... interactions as follows: 

[&amp;yEarth&amp;n] - conflicts vigorously, though perhaps not violently. 
[&amp;BWater&amp;n] - conflicts or supports depending on usage as both are
feminine, but one is active and one passive. 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] - again, varying effects 

&amp;yEarth&amp;n - manipulates solids, controls cohesion and disintegration...
interactions as follows: 

[&amp;BWater&amp;n] - Complementary flows, these can support one another 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] - varying effects

&amp;BWater&amp;n - manipulates liquids, controls cohesion and disintegration
(similar to &amp;yEarth&amp;n) 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] - varying effects

&amp;WSpirit&amp;n - life force, manipulates other flows, dampens or heightens the
effects of other flows, and can be used for shielding,etc.

This information is most useful when improvising with the one power,
weaving things that are not specifically covered elsewhere in the
syllabus. It is especially useful for the Emote Channeling lesson.

      <description>
&amp;RFIRE&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Fire thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WHeat&amp;n - thin flows of fire used to warm up something. Until this weave
is learned, the student eats his meals cold. An example: 

&amp;cJoe seizes Saidin and channels thin flows of fire into the basin of
water. After a very brief moment, steam begins to rise from the bowl.&amp;n

&amp;WFlame&amp;n - single thin flow of Fire with a twist or loop at the end to
concentrate the flow enough to induce a visible flame. An example:

&amp;cJoe holds out his hand, palm upwards, and channels a thin thread of
fire tightly twisted at the end. A small flame suddenly springs into
existance, dancing over his open hand.&amp;n

&amp;WTest&amp;n - uses the flame from the previous example to determine if a man
has the ability to channel. The subject must cooperate and concentrate
on the visible flame hovering over the testers hand. If the subject
can channel, after several moments the tester will feel something
similar to an echo from the subject. An example:

&amp;cJoe holds out his hand and channels, causing a small flame to dance
over his open palm. He instructs Bob to concentrate on the flame and
then cocks his head slightly as if listening for something. After
several moments, he nods slightly and lets the flame wink out. He
slowly lowers his hand to his side and says in a sad tone, &quot;You can
channel. May the Light protect you.&quot;&amp;n
&amp;WIgnite&amp;n - insert flow of Fire into target, and use to cause target to
burst into flames
 weave can be practiced up to equivalent of
firestorm code weave. An example: 

&amp;cJoe steps back from the fireplace and studies the wood stacked in it
for a moment. He seizes Saidin and channels, spinning out a thick
thread of Fire which he inserts into the largest log. He forces energy
into the wood and watches with a smug smile as it bursts into flame.&amp;n

As with any of the lessons, the student can request to have this taught
to him if he feels the need for extra explanation or training. The
Test weave is a special case in that if it is taught ICly, then the
student will be set with the gskill. He can also obtain the skill at
any time in this subrank by demonstrating to anyone with gskillset
ability that he has a firm grasp on the weave.

      <description>
&amp;yEARTH&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Earth thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WShape Stone&amp;n -use flows of Earth to rearrange the composition of dirt or
stone so as to shape it without touching it or using a chisel or other
tool. An example: 

&amp;cJoe stares down at the slab of rock with what appears to be a dog's
footprint in the center of it. His nose wrinkles slightly from the
smell of brimstone. Seizing Saidin, he channels a thread of earth into
the stone and slowly smooths away the darkhound's track.&amp;n

&amp;WErupt&amp;n - use Earth to cause a fountain of displaced earth - directly
beneath your opponent or your opponent's horse. An example: 

&amp;cJoe stands his ground, an arrogant sneer on his face and his fists on
his hips as the lancer bears down on him. Suddenly he spins thick,
tightly twisted flows of earth into the ground just ahead of the
horseman and watches with grim satisfaction as displaced dirt and
stone fountain skyward.&amp;n 

</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="spirit">
      <description>
&amp;WSPIRIT&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Spirit thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WDestroying Knots&amp;n - this consists of using flows of Spirit to knock/pick
apart the knot holding a weave in place. One method is to use the fine
thread of spirit to untie the knot, or pick it apart much like one
would use his fingernails on a knot in a piece of string. Another
method is to insert a thin thread of spirit inside the knot and &quot;flex&quot;
it, shattering the knot. Examples: 

&amp;cJoe examines the knotted weave for a moment, then seizes Saidin. He
spins out a very fine thread of Spirit and slowly worms it inside the
knot. Once it is fully inside, he puts more energy into the thread,
expanding it as if flexing a muscle hard. The knot shatters and the
weave it held unravels.&amp;n 

&amp;cJoe spins out a fine thread of Spirit and uses it to slowly pick apart
and untie the knot on the Airwall weave. As he finally works the knot
apart, he steps back with a triumphant grin and watch as the weave
fades away.&amp;n 

&amp;WShield&amp;n - Flows of Spirit, heavily formed into an axe-like construct to
be slammed between the victim and saidin or at his connection to
saidin if he is grasping already. An example: 

&amp;cJoe channels thick flows of spirit into a wedge shape and attempts to
slam it between Bob and his connection to Saidin.&amp;n 

&amp;WDelve&amp;n - Flows of Spirit used as a fine probe to determine the extent of
a patient's injuries. An example: 

&amp;cJoe places his hands on Bob's head and spins out fine flows of Spirit
to probe through his body to determine the exent of his injuries.&amp;n

</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="air">
      <description>
&amp;CAIR&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Air thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WAirshield&amp;n - single flow of Air twisted into a tightly-spun plate of
steel-hard air to deflect a blow. An example: 

&amp;cJoe glares at the charging soldier, Saidin held ready. As the man makes
his double-handed overhead slash down at Joe, he spins a thread of air
into a steel-hard plate and interposes it between his head and the
descending blade to deflect the blow with a loud clang.&amp;n 

&amp;WAirwall&amp;n - like Airshield, but more solid and tied off to allow it to
exist outside of the maker's control. An example: 

&amp;cJoe spins out thick flows of Air, weaving them tightly together to form
a solid, shimmering wall in front of him about five feet high and ten
feet across.&amp;n 

&amp;WAirblow&amp;n - smack someone with a hardened flow of Air, be it as hard and
thick as a fist, or like a whip. An example: 

&amp;cJoe channels flow of Air into a club-like construct and directs it at
the insolent peasant, attempting to crack it across the base of his
skull.&amp;n 

&amp;WBind&amp;n - use bands of Air to restrict someone's ability to move. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe spins out thick bands of air and tries to slip them around Bob in
an attempt to bind his arms to his sides and prevent his movement.&amp;n 

&amp;WGag&amp;n - stuff the victim's mouth with a flow of Air so he can't talk. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe lets out a sigh of exasperation at the woman's ceasless babbling.
With an irritated sounding mutter, he channels a flow of air into a
hardened mass about half the size of his fist and attempts to stop up
her mouth with it.&amp;n 

&amp;WDeaf&amp;n - block someone's ears with masses of hardened Air to impede
hearing. An example:

&amp;cJoe pauses his interrogation of the prisoner and wraps thick bands of
hardened air around him, blocking his ears. Then he turns to the
observing attack leader and says,&quot;Baijan'm'hael, I do not think he
knows anything.&quot;&amp;n 

&amp;WLift&amp;n - bands of Air like Bind, used to lift the victim or target.
Difficult, and requires a lot of the One Power. The more weight you
lift, and the higher you lift it, the more of the Power you need. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe wraps flows of Air around the stone and slowly lifts it. As the
large rock climbs higher into the air, a frown of concentration
appears on Joe's face and the menace of Saidin becomes stronger around
him as he draws more deeply on the One Power.&amp;n

&amp;BWATER&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Water thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WDry&amp;n - use Water to remove moisture from your clothing/hair/etc. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe reaches down and grasps the girl's forearm and pulls her from the
puddle. Once she is again firmly on dry ground, he seizes Saidin. He
channels thin flows of water to direct the moisture in the girl's hair
and clothing, causing it to puddle up around her on the ground.&amp;n

&amp;WCall Water&amp;n - move water around with flows of Water. An example: 

&amp;cJoe spins a thick thread of Water into the fountain and forms a wave
which he slowly rocks back and forth causing water to splash out onto
the cobblestones.&amp;n

&amp;GHEAL&amp;n

Flows of Water, Air, and Spirit woven into an intricate, gauze-like
mesh that is then run through the patient's entire body, healing
whatever injuries it encounters. The effectiveness of the weave is
determined by how much talent for Healing the weaver has. Some would
only have the ability to Heal bruises with it, while others could fan
the faintest spark of life back to full health. Most however will fall
somewhere in between. For most this will be able to heal simple
injuries. 

It is generally better to delve the subject first to determine the
extent of the energies so that you may better direct the weave or even
determine if the injuries are within your talents. After delving, you
could oocly discuss the injuries with the patient, through tells or
osays so that they can inform you how badly they are hurt. 

According to Damer Flinn, Asha'man Healing hurts compared to the
Healing the Aes Sedai use. Some other differences in the sensation is
that instead of a wave of cold passing through the patient's body, it
is a wave of heat. This is not a pleasant warmth, but enough heat to
be very uncomfortable or even slightly painful. 

An example: 

&amp;cJoe places his hands on the injured man's head and weaves flows of
Water, Spirit and Air into a fine mesh. He then moves the weave
throughout the patient's body from head to toes, the weave seeking out
and repairing any damage it finds along the way, the flesh ripping and
knitting in a wave as the weave passes through.&amp;n

&amp;GFORMS&amp;n

These are included for completeness. This is the general interpretation
of the forms used on Dragon's Fang. Or it was the last time that this
author played a Warder Instructor. If any of them are out of date,
please let me know and I will have them changed. In general, forms are
not terribly useful in emote fighting. Some of them may occasionally
be of use, however. They are provided here so that Black Tower members
will have access to the same forms interpretation used elsewhere on
the MUD. 

&amp;WArc of the Moon&amp;n: (defense and riposte) - A high, left to right
horizontal parry, designed to knock aside an incoming downward or
diagonal attack, followed immediately by a return slash aimed across
the throat from right to left. Can also be performed kneeling, in
which case counterslash aims for stomach or chest. 

&amp;WThe Bee Stings&amp;n: (Disarm) Twine your sword with your opponents, sliding
yours down his blade until your point pricks his hand, followed by a
quick snap of your weapon. Notes: Places you in close proximity to
your opponent. Should not be used during dual weapon combat. 

&amp;WThe Bell Rings&amp;n: Brute force disarm. Strike your opponent's weapon a
ringing blow, forcing it from from his grasp. Notes: Do not attempt
this against a stronger foe, or one with a two handed weapon. May
damage your own weapon as well as your opponent's. 

&amp;WBoar Rushes Down the Mountain&amp;n: (all-out attack) Rushing ahead with many
slashes and stabs, barreling and whirling. Generally, it seems like a
wild attack, but is quite well controlled. Notes: Used to press an
advantage, don't lose control. Countered by: Cat Dances on the Wall

&amp;WBundling Straw&amp;n: (defense - counterattack) Sword held parallel to body,
point up, and moves horizontally across the body, used to parry.
Immediately after parrying, the sword slashes downward at the
attacker's stomach and legs, moving in the opposite direction as
before. 

&amp;WCat Dances on the Wall&amp;n: (defense) Walk forward and backward along an
imaginary wall, keeping feet in a straight line, parrying the whole
while. Each parry is supposed to be light and fast, only powerful
enough to sufficiently block the blow, to avoid tiring. This form
Counters: Boar Rushes Down the Mountain 

&amp;WCat on Hot Sand&amp;n: (defense) Leap to avoid an attack, parrying once to
meet a second attack. Move is left, right, and/or back, but never
forward, as forward motion can get you impaled. Combines the concepts
of dodging and parrying into one technique. This form is the counter
to Parting the Silk. 

&amp;WThe Creeper Embraces the Oak&amp;n: (close attack) Parry an incoming attack,
sending it to the left if right-handed or the right if left-handed.
Step forward, close to your opponent, and drop the hilt of your blade
to waist height so it's point up. Proceed to make an upward thrust
aimed to pierce beneath his chin, and then follow up with a draw cut
aimed down the chest. Repeat in alternating fashion if needed, or
disengage by stepping back into a guard position. Note: Good timing is
essential for success. 

&amp;WDandelion in the Wind&amp;n: (evasion) - sway to avoid incoming thrusts to
the head or upper torso, moving to one side or another and stepping
backward to open distance between you and your opponent. 

&amp;WThe Falcon Stoops&amp;n: (counterattack) Though not a defense form, this is
commonly used after a parry as a counterattack. Start with a quick
fake to the side of the head (this should prevent the opponent from
moving closer or attacking) and immediately follow with a step forward
and a diagonal slash down the opponent's torso. 

&amp;WFolding the Fan&amp;n: (sheathing move) Flourishing sheathing move. Make it
as flowery and impressive as possible. 

&amp;WThe Grapevine Twines&amp;n: (disarm) Tap opponent's blade (versus a thrust),
followed by leaning into opponent's sword arc, before the opponent can
recover from the tap, twine your sword with his, then snap your wrist.

&amp;G2.FORMS&amp;n

&amp;WHeron Spreads His Wings&amp;n: (attack) Both arms are quickly spread out and
up, to about 30 degrees above horizontal. The blade should be aimed to
slash upward from the groin to the throat. It is important to bring
your defense back up quickly. 

&amp;WHeron Wading in the Rushes&amp;n: (attack - balance training) Rise up to
stand balanced on the ball of your left foot, with your right leg
lifted so that your knee is up on a level with your waist and your
pointed right toes are brushing the inside of your left knee. Lift
your sword above your head, holding it so that its tip is pointed
ahead of you, parallel to the ground. Place your left hand near the
handguard, and place your right hand on the pommel of the swordhilt
for leverage. The attack com s when you step forward with your right
foot and make a stabbing attack at your imagined opponent's chest,
using your sword like the bill of a huge bird of prey. 

&amp;WKingfisher Takes a Silverback&amp;n: (low attack) A short, quick slash to the
outside of the opponents knee. Almost all of the sword's motion should
be caused by the wrists instead of the arm. This is a good maneuver to
do as a counterattack, as the opponent's own motion makes the strike
more harmful. 

&amp;WLeaf on the Breeze&amp;n: (defense - counterattack) Half-spin (feet not
moving) with three quick parries followed by spinning back and a short
slash. Counters: Lightning of the Three Prongs 

&amp;WLightning of the Three Prongs&amp;n: (attack) Three fast thrusts to the head.
These thrusts are very quick and controlled: putting too much power
behind the attack will pull you out of position. First thrust to the
left, then to the right, then to the center. Counter: Leaf on the
Breeze 

&amp;WLizard in the Thornbush&amp;n: (opportunity attack) A lunging thrust to the
opponent's throat, followed by a quick step back and a diagonal slash
across the torso. Note: Commonly used against multiple opponents to
take one of them out quickly. 

&amp;WLow Wind Rising&amp;n: (seated unsheathing attack) While seated, draw the
blade and immediately slash at a standing foe's throat, then follow
with a downward slash. Note: A mix between Flame Before the Whirlwind
and Parting the Silk. 

&amp;WMoon Over Water&amp;n: (defense) Trace a wide arc from one side to the other,
sword pointing mostly up. Can be used either fast or slow, depending
on the circumstances. Can block more than one frontal attack at a
time. 

&amp;WParting the Silk&amp;n: (attack) Fast, strong horizontal cut (neck) followed
by a downward diagonal slash (shoulder to opposite hip). First strike
can be countered by a backward leap, but may leave open to second
strike. Notes: This form can be countered by: Cat on Hot Sand 

&amp;WRibbon in the Air&amp;n: (defense) Begin with a light parry to one side,
holding the sword vertical, point up. Immediately after, a strong
parry is thrown to the other side, while the body is turned to follow
the sword, keeping the back foot stationary and moving the front so
that the body moves about 90 degrees, like a door swinging open. This
form Counters: Stones Falling Down the Mountain 

&amp;WRiver Undercuts the Bank&amp;n: (low attack) Drop to one knee, fast
horizontal slash, sweeping at the opponent's knees. Designed to take
advantage of a high defense. Best Countered by: Swallow Rides the Air 

&amp;WThe Rose Unfolds&amp;n: (unsheathing defense) Draw sword, and whip through a
tight arc from left to right (in case of left-handed practitioner,
reverse directions) across body, to deflect an incoming slash or
thrust. 

&amp;WStones Falling Down the Mountain&amp;n: (attack) A two-slash attack. The
first is a backhand slash to the opponent's temple, and the second is
performed by bringing the sword up, still going in the same direction
as the initial attack, and circling around to slash diagonally down
across the base of the neck. Note: This form can be countered by
Ribbon in the Air or Unfolding the Fan.

&amp;G3.FORMS&amp;n

&amp;WStones Falling From the Cliff&amp;n: (surprise attack) - leap forward, making
a single downward slash at your opponent's head, neck, or shoulders,
employing your weight to power the blow. Distance is of primary
importance here, as you will be impaled on his blade if you are too
close when you make the leap. 

&amp;WStriking the Spark&amp;n: (attack or defense) A strong, sometimes two-handed,
strike aimed at the haft or base of the blade of an opponent's weapon.
(In the style of The Bell Rings) Attack: When aimed properly at the
place where the blade meets the hilt, this blow can break a sword if
your blade is better quality than your foe's. It is quite effective
when a steel sword is used against a wooden one. Defense: Aimed at the
hilt, this form can stop an incoming blow rather effectively, though
it usually doesn't lend itself well to making a counter strike
afterward. 

&amp;WThe Sun Rises&amp;n: (attack or defense) A long upward slash. Attack:
designed to use the tip of the blade to slash at the chest of an
unarmored opponent. Defense: used against downward attacks, but is
relatively slow for a defensive form, and should not be used out of
position. 

&amp;WThe Swallow Rides the Air&amp;n: (defense) Step both feet away from the
incoming attack while bringing the blade down to deflect the blow. The
sword should be held vertically, point down, at the end of the parry.
Counters: Water Flows Downhill, River Undercuts the Bank, and other
low strikes. 

&amp;WThe Swallow Takes Flight&amp;n: (defense - counterattack or defense) A parry,
sword held vertically (point up) done while turning the body away from
the attack. Counterattack: Follow with a rising backhand slash aimed
at the side of the head or the neck. Defense: Follow instead with
another parry, holding the sword diagonally downward, while stepping
away again. 

&amp;WThistledown Floats on the Whirlwind&amp;n: (attack) A jumping, spinning cut
to the neck. Jump toward your opponent and spin backwards (clockwise
if right-handed, counter-clockwise if left) and slash as you come
down. Note: Distance and surprise are vital. If you are too close to
your opponent, you will not get the force behind the blow and you will
be left wide open to a fast counterattack. 

&amp;WUnfolding the Fan&amp;n: (defense) This is a circular parry. For a
right-handed practitioner, the sword starts at about the 10 or 11
o'clock position and moves clockwise (a left handed practitioner
starts at 1 or 2 'clock). This parry, if properly timed, will knock
away downward and diagonal attacks. It is best used in combination
with other forms and maneuvers. Counters: Stones Falling Down the
Mountain (either or both strikes). 

&amp;WWatered Silk&amp;n: (attack) The form starts with a crouch accompanied by a
slash across the abdomen, and is immediately followed with a strong
thrust to the heart, making sure to hold the sword parallel to the
ground, as having the blade at the wrong angle will lesson the
effectiveness of the blow and could possibly cause you to lose the
grip on your weapon. Notes: Best countered by Falling Leaf 

&amp;WWater Flows Downhill&amp;n: (defense - counterattack) Step to one side
quickly and crouch, while thrusting the blade at the opponent's groin.
Note: Timing is very important This form is best countered by Cat on
Hot Sand, or Swallow Rides the Air

&amp;G4.FORMS&amp;n

&amp;WWhirlwind on the Mountain&amp;n: (attack) A spinning backhand slash (the spin
should be clockwise for a right-handed practitioner) aimed at the
opponent's neck. Properly judging the distance between you and your
foe is vital, as is making sure that you bring your head around to
face your opponent before the rest of your body gets there, especially
the blade. As well, keep in mind that this form presents a wide
opening against a prepared foe. 

&amp;WWood Grouse Dances&amp;n: (defense - repeated counterattack) Start by
sidestepping an incoming attack, going to your right (if
right-handed). As the foot hits the ground, thrust. If the attack
fails to land, repeat by going to the opposite side (left, if right
handed). Continue to alternate to press an advantage.

&amp;RRolling Ring Group Tactic&amp;n

As one could guess from the title, this is not a weave, but a tactic.
It is a method for a large number of men channeling in conjunction to
wreak a great deal of damage to enemy forces. It would require at the
very least three men to perform. 

Working together, several men would form a semi-circle (or a full
circle if there were enough men and the circumstances merit it). Each
man would channel flows of fire and earth twisted together in a thick
braid to form his section of the circle and cast the weave into the
ground in front of him, sending it outward in waves in time with the
other men. It is important that the men work in rhythm, much like a
rowing crew. 

The results of this tactic are that the ground ripples away from the
men in a wave much like a wave in the ocean or the ground in an
earthquake. Mingled in with the heaving and rolling ground are gouts
of fire and molten rock which fountain up at random intervals. Someone
else describes it as a tidal wave of superheated, flaming dirt.
Against a tightly packed formation, this tactic is devastating. 

Although this is certainly the most spectacular thing men are taught to
do in the Black Tower, it has only limited usefulness. It is effective
only against close range, tightly packed formations. It is invaluable
in those situations, but these things do not occur very often in our
roleplay.

&amp;CDOME OF AIR&amp;n

Each of the at least three participants weaves an Airshield, and they
butt them against each other into a single solid dome of Air. Due to
the nature of RP on the MUD, this is not a tactic that will see much
use. Mostly it would be of use to protect large groups against volleys
of arrows or other long-range attacks.

&amp;GSKILLED SYLLABUS WEAVES&amp;n

&amp;RExplode&amp;n:

Fire and Earth, twisted together on one another into a lance-like
construct. Applied to a live target, it will cause the victim to
explode rather messily. Applied to rock, it causes rock to explode,
slinging razor-like shards that necessitate the use of an Airshield
weave to avoid danger of injury. An example: 

&amp;cJoe weaves Fire and Earth together into a lance-like construct that he
spears into the heart of the boulder. Immediately, he follows by
spinning a flow of Air into a steel-hard plate in front of him, just
in time to protect himself from the shards of rock sent flying by the
exploding stone.&amp;n 

&amp;RFireball&amp;n:

This weave consists of a thin shell of Air, formed into a hollow sphere
to contain a mass of jumbled-up flows of Fire. The entire construct is
sent hurtling towards the target, and upon reaching a close enough
proximity, the Air is tightened up to bring it into close association
with the Fire, thereby bringing about a concussive blast of flame and
heat sufficient to burn a cluster of attackers and throw them
violently about. Due to the fairly complex nature of the weaving, and
to its concussive traits, it is best used at a distance to give time
to weave it properly and to avoid injury to oneself. 

&amp;RShaft of Fire&amp;n:

This weave is designed for distances closer than those that a fireball
would lend itself to. A tube is woven out of flows of Spirit, and used
to act as a conduit to guide and contain massive flows of Fire,
directing them towards the opposition, much in the manner of a modern
flamethrower.

&amp;KTAINT&amp;n

When Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions sealed the Dark One and the
Forsaken back into the prison, Saidin was tainted by the Dark One's
counterstroke. 

Saidin is like a clear, pure pool, but the taint lies atop it like a
slick of oil or the scummy film on a stagnant pond. Saidin is still
pure beneath that film, but it cannot be touched without reaching
through the taint and touching it as well. Every time a man channels
Saidin he brings more of the taint into himself. 

Because of this taint, every man who channels will eventually become
mad unless he is captured and gentled(permanently cut off from the One
Power). If he continues to live after the madness, the very advanced
stages of the taint include a rotting alive affect, similar to
leprosy. 

Each man resists taint differently. Some go mad in a matter of days,
while others have channeled for as much as a decade without
succumbing. Regardless of how long it takes, eventually it is
inevitable. The price of touching tainted Saidin is madness and death.

In game terms, it is up to each person to decide how tainted his
character is. The vast range of time it can take for someone to give
in to the madness makes it incredibly difficult to come up with a fair
system for determining it. It is also somewhat contrary to good RP to
just arbitrarily force someone to play his character as being
taint-mad. Use your own best judgement and discretion in regards to
the taint in your RP.

&amp;GTACTICS&amp;n

There is a time and a place for the best use of each weave. The purpose
of this lecture is to give some examples of situations for which
certain weaves are best suited. This cannot possibly cover all
situations which may arise. Instead it is intended to give a general
idea. 

Fireball produces a concussive blast and has good range. This makes it
ideal for breaking up formations or discouraging or eliminating
charges. 

Lightning is a rather impressive, long range attack that does not
really have a lot of accuracy. It lends itself to large or tightly
packed formations some distance away. It has the added value of being
loud and frightening. A good first strike weave for breaking up a unit
and totally demoralizing or terrifying it. 

Shaft of Fire is good for mid range combat. Situations where the enemy
is too close for the blast of a fireball to be safely used, but too
far away for easy selection of individual targets. This weave allows
you to hose fire across the front ranks of an enemy unit, likely
injuring or killing many of them. 

Explode is multi-purpose, but mostly of use against fairly close range
targets. If the enemy is close enough for easy selection of individual
targets, the weave is ideal for blowing heads off. It can be flicked
quickly from target to target allowing for easy disintegration of a
nearby unit. If that unit is too close or has a very strong morale,
the weave is good for use against any solid rock or metal target in
their midst to send deadly shrapnel flying through the unit.

&amp;GTRAINED SYLLABUS WEAVES&amp;n

&amp;yCone of Silence&amp;n:

This is a warding against sound, either to keep sound out or to keep it
inside. Flows of Air, Earth, and Spirit are laced into a tapestry-like
pattern that can be knotted in place or held for the duration of its
needed time. 

&amp;YL&amp;Wi&amp;Yg&amp;Wh&amp;Yt&amp;Wn&amp;Yi&amp;Wn&amp;Yg &amp;WB&amp;Yo&amp;Wl&amp;Yt&amp;n:

Flows of Water and Fire are extended towards the target, placed closely
together so as to produce tension that will provide the potential for
a lightning bolt. The bolt is 'thrown' by using a thin flow of Spirit
to bridge between the Water and Fire, closing the gap between them and
bringing about a massive electrical discharge. 

&amp;YBall of Light&amp;n:

The practitioner weaves a hollow shell of Air, and fills it with a few
twisted strands of Fire to produce an incandescence that provides
light. Depending on how thick the flows are, the light can be dim or
bright enough to tie off in midair as the light source for a small
battle. 

&amp;CVoice Amplification&amp;n:

Tendrils of Air, laced with Fire to activate them and allow them to
conduct and amplify sound are woven in rays extending outward from the
practitioner, producing the effect of a loudspeaker. Useful in the
extreme for large-scale lessons, for relaying battle commands, and for
being intimidating in general.

&amp;RP&amp;ra&amp;Ri&amp;rn&amp;W:&amp;n

Flows of Spirit lightly touched with tendrils of fire are woven into a
complex mesh. When this weave touches the victim, it affects the nerves
such that they feel extreme, agonizing pain.

&amp;WTRAVELLING&amp;n

Travelling Weave lesson may be given anytime the student has the IC and
code strength for it. 

Pure Spirit is channeled into a spear-like construct and used to punch
a hole in the Pattern, leading from one place to another. You must
know the place you are in before you can Travel to another place,
unless you are only going such a short distance that you can see your
destination. It generally takes a few hours to learn a place well
enough to Travel from it. Although this varies slightly from person to
person. The time can be greatly lessoned, approximately halved, if the
One Power is held the entire time one waits. 
The edges of the gateway are incredibly sharp, able to apparently cut
through anything. It is therefore vital that you do not gate into a
high traffic area. In Caemlyn we have a room set aside in the Golden
Bowl for ICly gating. 

Contrary to the impression that one might glean from the way the weave
works in code on the MUD, a gateway does not automatically close when
the weaver steps through. It stays open as long as he holds the weave,
regardless which side he is on. 

An example of the weave: 

&amp;cJoe seizes Saidin and channels thick flows of Spirit into a
spear-shaped weave which he seemingly stabs directly into the pattern,
boring a hole to his destination. A vertical slash of light appears
and rapidly widens into a hole in the air through which can be seen
the cellar of the Golden Bowl.&amp;n 

While RPing the lesson, the instructor should teach the student the
weave in code, as well. This may require notifying the Imm GL to have
the proper special skill flag set on the student.

The student should read the following lessons and become familiar with
the material presented in them.

&amp;b   *&amp;nFlow Theory and Comparison(&amp;Wread theory&amp;n)
&amp;b   *&amp;nHeal Weave(&amp;Wread heal&amp;n)
&amp;b   *&amp;nSword Forms(&amp;Wread forms&amp;n)

The student should receive the following OOC lessons:

&amp;b   *&amp;nEmote Channeling
&amp;b   *&amp;nAdvanced Emote Channeling

Student should do the following RP sessions:

&amp;b   *&amp;nA sword spar(one-on-one)
&amp;b   *&amp;nA channeling spar(one-on-one)

If a student does not feel he fully grasps the material just from
reading it, he may request to be taught it.

Once these things are completed, the student is ready to be tested.
Anyone of Trained subrank or higher may give the test. The student
must demonstrate a good grasp of the material in the syllabus in
theory and in use. If the student needs more practice, he will not be
promoted. If the student does not pass, he may try again in two days
(real time). This test is important as passing it signifies competence
with basic channeling, if not necessarily knowledge of advanced
weaves. One of Skilled subrank should be a force to be reckoned with
by anyone outside the Black Tower. If the student does pass and is
promoted, his grasp and release will be set to 100 and he will gain 
Enh. Spell Damage and Rolling Ring at 80.

      <description>&amp;GTRAVELLING&amp;n

Travelling Weave lesson may be given anytime the student has the IC and
code strength for it. 

Pure Spirit is channeled into a spear-like construct and used to punch
a hole in the Pattern, leading from one place to another. You must
know the place you are in before you can Travel to another place,
unless you are only going such a short distance that you can see your
destination. It generally takes a few hours to learn a place well
enough to Travel from it. Although this varies slightly from person to
person. The time can be greatly lessoned, approximately halved, if the
One Power is held the entire time one waits. 
The edges of the gateway are incredibly sharp, able to apparently cut
through anything. It is therefore vital that you do not gate into a
high traffic area. In Caemlyn we have a room set aside in the Golden
Bowl for ICly gating. 

Contrary to the impression that one might glean from the way the weave
works in code on the MUD, a gateway does not automatically close when
the weaver steps through. It stays open as long as he holds the weave,
regardless which side he is on. 

An example of the weave: 

&amp;cJoe seizes Saidin and channels thick flows of Spirit into a
spear-shaped weave which he seemingly stabs directly into the pattern,
boring a hole to his destination. A vertical slash of light appears
and rapidly widens into a hole in the air through which can be seen
the cellar of the Golden Bowl. &amp;n

While RPing the lesson, the instructor should teach the student the
weave in code, as well. This may require notifying the Imm GL to have
the proper special skill flag set on the student.

This is the highest rank many in the Black Tower will achieve.
Due to the political nature of the rank of Asha'man, sponsor-
ship by Mazrim is needed to advance to it, or it must be proven
to the satisfaction of the Guildleader that the player in 
question has performed some event that would qualify him
for promotion even without Mazrim's sponsorship(this is
very rare and hard to prove; killing a Dreadlord may not
even be enough to qualify.)

      <description>Dedicated[Junior] SYLLABUS WEAVES

&amp;YLightning Bolt&amp;n:

Flows of Water and Fire are extended towards the target, placed closely
together so as to produce tension that will provide the potential for
a lightning bolt. The bolt is 'thrown' by using a thin flow of Spirit
to bridge between the Water and Fire, closing the gap between them and
bringing about a massive electrical discharge. 

&amp;WCone of Silence&amp;n:

This is a warding against sound, either to keep sound out or to keep it
inside. Flows of Air, Earth, and Spirit are laced into a tapestry-like
pattern that can be knotted in place or held for the duration of its
needed time. 

&amp;WBall of Light&amp;n:

The practitioner weaves a hollow shell of Air, and fills it with a few
twisted strands of Fire to produce an incandescence that provides
light. Depending on how thick the flows are, the light can be dim or
bright enough to tie off in midair as the light source for a small
battle.

&amp;CVoice Amplification&amp;n:

Tendrils of Air, laced with Fire to activate them and allow them to
conduct and amplify sound are woven in rays extending outward from the
practitioner, producing the effect of a loudspeaker. Useful in the extreme 
for large-scale lessons, for relaying battle commands, and for
being intimidating in general. 

&amp;RPain&amp;n:

Flows of Spirit lightly touched with tendrils of fire are woven into a
complex mesh. When this weave touches the victim, it affects the nerves
such that they feel extreme, agonizing pain.

      <description>&amp;GDOME OF AIR GROUP TACTIC&amp;n

Each of the at least three participants weaves an Airshield, and they
butt them against each other into a single solid dome of Air. Due to
the nature of RP on the MUD, this is not a tactic that will see much
use. Mostly it would be of use to protect large groups against volleys
of arrows or other long-range attacks.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="ring">
      <description>&amp;GRolling Ring Group Tactic&amp;n

As one could guess from the title, this is not a weave, but a tactic.
It is a method for a large number of men channeling in conjunction to
wreak a great deal of damage to enemy forces. It would require at the
very least three men to perform. 

Working together, several men would form a semi-circle (or a full
circle if there were enough men and the circumstances merit it). Each
man would channel flows of fire and earth twisted together in a thick
braid to form his section of the circle and cast the weave into the
ground in front of him, sending it outward in waves in time with the
other men. It is important that the men work in rhythm, much like a
rowing crew. 

The results of this tactic are that the ground ripples away from the
men in a wave much like a wave in the ocean or the ground in an
earthquake. Mingled in with the heaving and rolling ground are gouts
of fire and molten rock which fountain up at random intervals. Someone
else describes it as a tidal wave of superheated, flaming dirt.
Against a tightly packed formation, this tactic is devastating.

Although this is certainly the most spectacular thing men are taught to
do in the Black Tower, it has only limited usefulness. It is effective
only against close range, tightly packed formations. It is invaluable
in those situations, but these things do not occur very often in our
roleplay.

      <description>&amp;GNATURE OF THE TAINT&amp;n

When Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions sealed the Dark One and the
Forsaken back into the prison, Saidin was tainted by the Dark One's
counterstroke. 

Saidin is like a clear, pure pool, but the taint lies atop it like a
slick of oil or the scummy film on a stagnant pond. Saidin is still
pure beneath that film, but it cannot be touched without reaching
through the taint and touching it as well. Every time a man channels
Saidin he brings more of the taint into himself. 

Because of this taint, every man who channels will eventually become
mad unless he is captured and gentled(permanently cut off from the One
Power). If he continues to live after the madness, the very advanced
stages of the taint include a rotting alive affect, similar to
leprosy. 

Each man resists taint differently. Some go mad in a matter of days,
while others have channeled for as much as a decade without
succumbing. Regardless of how long it takes, eventually it is
inevitable. The price of touching tainted Saidin is madness and death. 

In game terms, it is up to each person to decide how tainted his
character is. The vast range of time it can take for someone to give
in to the madness makes it incredibly difficult to come up with a fair
system for determining it. It is also somewhat contrary to good RP to
just arbitrarily force someone to play his character as being
taint-mad. Use your own best judgement and discretion in regards to
the taint in RP.

    <exdesc keyword="heal">
      <description>&amp;GHEAL&amp;n

Flows of Water, Air, and Spirit woven into an intricate, gauze-like
mesh that is then run through the patient's entire body, healing
whatever injuries it encounters. The effectiveness of the weave is
determined by how much talent for Healing the weaver has. Some would
only have the ability to Heal bruises with it, while others could fan
the faintest spark of life back to full health. Most however will fall
somewhere in between. For most this will be able to heal simple
injuries.

It is generally better to delve the subject first to determine the
extent of the energies so that you may better direct the weave or even
determine if the injuries are within your talents. After delving, you
could oocly discuss the injuries with the patient, through tells or
osays so that they can inform you how badly they are hurt. 

According to Damer Flinn, Asha'man Healing hurts compared to the
Healing the Aes Sedai use. Some other differences in the sensation is
that instead of a wave of cold passing through the patient's body, it
is a wave of heat. This is not a pleasant warmth, but enough heat to
be very uncomfortable or even slightly painful. 

An example:

&amp;cJoe places his hands on the injured man's head and weaves flows of
Water, Spirit and Air into a fine mesh. He then moves the weave
throughout the patient's body from head to toes, the weave seeking out
and repairing any damage it finds along the way, the flesh ripping and
knitting in a wave as the weave passes through. &amp;n

      <description>&amp;GSOLDIER[SKILLED] WEAVES

&amp;RExplode&amp;n:

Fire and Earth, twisted together on one another into a lance-like
construct. Applied to a live target, it will cause the victim to
explode rather messily. Applied to rock, it causes rock to explode,
slinging razor-like shards that necessitate the use of an Airshield
weave to avoid danger of injury. An example: 

&amp;cJoe weaves Fire and Earth together into a lance-like construct that he
spears into the heart of the boulder. Immediately, he follows by
spinning a flow of Air into a steel-hard plate in front of him, just
in time to protect himself from the shards of rock sent flying by the
exploding stone.&amp;n

&amp;RFireball&amp;n:

This weave consists of a thin shell of Air, formed into a hollow sphere
to contain a mass of jumbled-up flows of Fire. The entire construct is
sent hurtling towards the target, and upon reaching a close enough
proximity, the Air is tightened up to bring it into close association
with the Fire, thereby bringing about a concussive blast of flame and
heat sufficient to burn a cluster of attackers and throw them
violently about. Due to the fairly complex nature of the weaving, and
to its concussive traits, it is best used at a distance to give time
to weave it properly and to avoid injury to oneself. 

&amp;RShaft of Fire&amp;n:
This weave is designed for distances closer than those that a fireball
would lend itself to. A tube is woven out of flows of Spirit, and used
to act as a conduit to guide and contain massive flows of Fire,
directing them towards the opposition, much in the manner of a modern
flamethrower.

      <description>&amp;GFORMS 4&amp;n

&amp;WWood Grouse Dances&amp;n: (defense - repeated counterattack) Start by
sidestepping an incoming attack, going to your right (if
right-handed). As the foot hits the ground, thrust. If the attack
fails to land, repeat by going to the opposite side (left, if right
handed). Continue to alternate to press an advantage. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="forms3">
      <description>&amp;GFORMS 3&amp;n

&amp;WStones Falling From the Cliff&amp;n: (surprise attack) - leap forward, making
a single downward slash at your opponent's head, neck, or shoulders,
employing your weight to power the blow. Distance is of primary
importance here, as you will be impaled on his blade if you are too
close when you make the leap.

&amp;WStriking the Spark&amp;n: (attack or defense) A strong, sometimes two-handed,
strike aimed at the haft or base of the blade of an opponent's weapon.
(In the style of The Bell Rings) Attack: When aimed properly at the
place where the blade meets the hilt, this blow can break a sword if
your blade is better quality than your foe's. It is quite effective
when a steel sword is used against a wooden one. Defense: Aimed at the
hilt, this form can stop an incoming blow rather effectively, though
it usually doesn't lend itself well to making a counter strike
afterward. 

&amp;WThe Sun Rises&amp;n: (attack or defense) A long upward slash. Attack:
designed to use the tip of the blade to slash at the chest of an
unarmored opponent. Defense: used against downward attacks, but is
relatively slow for a defensive form, and should not be used out of
position. 

&amp;WThe Swallow Rides the Air&amp;n: (defense) Step both feet away from the
incoming attack while bringing the blade down to deflect the blow. The
sword should be held vertically, point down, at the end of the parry.
Counters: Water Flows Downhill, River Undercuts the Bank, and other
low strikes. 

&amp;WThe Swallow Takes Flight&amp;n: (defense - counterattack or defense) A parry,
sword held vertically (point up) done while turning the body away from
the attack. Counterattack: Follow with a rising backhand slash aimed
at the side of the head or the neck. Defense: Follow instead with
another parry, holding the sword diagonally downward, while stepping
away again.

&amp;WThistledown Floats on the Whirlwind&amp;n: (attack) A jumping, spinning cut
to the neck. Jump toward your opponent and spin backwards (clockwise
if right-handed, counter-clockwise if left) and slash as you come
down. Note: Distance and surprise are vital. If you are too close to
your opponent, you will not get the force behind the blow and you will
be left wide open to a fast counterattack. 

&amp;WUnfolding the Fan&amp;n: (defense) This is a circular parry. For a
right-handed practitioner, the sword starts at about the 10 or 11
o'clock position and moves clockwise (a left handed practitioner
starts at 1 or 2 'clock). This parry, if properly timed, will knock
away downward and diagonal attacks. It is best used in combination
with other forms and maneuvers. Counters: Stones Falling Down the
Mountain (either or both strikes).

&amp;WWatered Silk&amp;n: (attack) The form starts with a crouch accompanied by a
slash across the abdomen, and is immediately followed with a strong
thrust to the heart, making sure to hold the sword parallel to the
ground, as having the blade at the wrong angle will lesson the
effectiveness of the blow and could possibly cause you to lose the
grip on your weapon. Notes: Best countered by Falling Leaf 

&amp;WWater Flows Downhill&amp;n: (defense - counterattack) Step to one side
quickly and crouch, while thrusting the blade at the opponent's groin.
Note: Timing is very important This form is best countered by Cat on
Hot Sand, or Swallow Rides the Air 

&amp;WWhirlwind on the Mountain&amp;n: (attack) A spinning backhand slash (the spin
should be clockwise for a right-handed practitioner) aimed at the
opponent's neck. Properly judging the distance between you and your
foe is vital, as is making sure that you bring your head around to
face your opponent before the rest of your body gets there, especially
the blade. As well, keep in mind that this form presents a wide
opening against a prepared foe.

      <description>&amp;GFORMS 2&amp;n

&amp;WHeron Spreads His Wings&amp;n: (attack) Both arms are quickly spread out and
up, to about 30 degrees above horizontal. The blade should be aimed to
slash upward from the groin to the throat. It is important to bring
your defense back up quickly. 

&amp;WHeron Wading in the Rushes&amp;n: (attack - balance training) Rise up to
stand balanced on the ball of your left foot, with your right leg
lifted so that your knee is up on a level with your waist and your
pointed right toes are brushing the inside of your left knee. Lift
your sword above your head, holding it so that its tip is pointed
ahead of you, parallel to the ground. Place your left hand near the
handguard, and place your right hand on the pommel of the swordhilt
for leverage. The attack com s when you step forward with your right
foot and make a stabbing attack at your imagined opponent's chest,
using your sword like the bill of a huge bird of prey. 

&amp;WKingfisher Takes a Silverback&amp;n: (low attack) A short, quick slash to the
outside of the opponents knee. Almost all of the sword's motion should
be caused by the wrists instead of the arm. This is a good maneuver to
do as a counterattack, as the opponent's own motion makes the strike
more harmful. 

&amp;WLeaf on the Breeze&amp;n: (defense - counterattack) Half-spin (feet not
moving) with three quick parries followed by spinning back and a short
slash. Counters: Lightning of the Three Prongs 

&amp;WLightning of the Three Prongs&amp;n: (attack) Three fast thrusts to the head.
These thrusts are very quick and controlled: putting too much power behind 
the attack will pull you out of position. First thrust to the
left, then to the right, then to the center. Counter: Leaf on the
Breeze 

&amp;WLizard in the Thornbush&amp;n: (opportunity attack) A lunging thrust to the
opponent's throat, followed by a quick step back and a diagonal slash
across the torso. Note: Commonly used against multiple opponents to
take one of them out quickly.

&amp;WLow Wind Rising&amp;n: (seated unsheathing attack) While seated, draw the
blade and immediately slash at a standing foe's throat, then follow
with a downward slash. Note: A mix between Flame Before the Whirlwind
and Parting the Silk.

&amp;WMoon Over Water&amp;n: (defense) Trace a wide arc from one side to the other,
sword pointing mostly up. Can be used either fast or slow, depending
on the circumstances. Can block more than one frontal attack at a
time. 

&amp;WParting the Silk&amp;n: (attack) Fast, strong horizontal cut (neck) followed
by a downward diagonal slash (shoulder to opposite hip). First strike
can be countered by a backward leap, but may leave open to second
strike. Notes: This form can be countered by: Cat on Hot Sand 

&amp;WRibbon in the Air&amp;n: (defense) Begin with a light parry to one side,
holding the sword vertical, point up. Immediately after, a strong
parry is thrown to the other side, while the body is turned to follow
the sword, keeping the back foot stationary and moving the front so
that the body moves about 90 degrees, like a door swinging open. This
form Counters: Stones Falling Down the Mountain 

&amp;WRiver Undercuts the Bank&amp;n: (low attack) Drop to one knee, fast
horizontal slash, sweeping at the opponent's knees. Designed to take
advantage of a high defense. Best Countered by: Swallow Rides the Air

&amp;WThe Rose Unfolds&amp;n: (unsheathing defense) Draw sword, and whip through a
tight arc from left to right (in case of left-handed practitioner,
reverse directions) across body, to deflect an incoming slash or
thrust.

&amp;WStones Falling Down the Mountain&amp;n: (attack) A two-slash attack. The
first is a backhand slash to the opponent's temple, and the second is
performed by bringing the sword up, still going in the same direction
as the initial attack, and circling around to slash diagonally down
across the base of the neck. Note: This form can be countered by
Ribbon in the Air or Unfolding the Fan.

      <description>&amp;GFORMS&amp;n

These are included for completeness. This is the general interpretation
of the forms used on Dragon's Fang. Or it was the last time that this
author played a Warder Instructor. If any of them are out of date,
please let me know and I will have them changed. In general, forms are
not terribly useful in emote fighting. Some of them may occasionally
be of use, however. They are provided here so that Black Tower members
will have access to the same forms interpretation used elsewhere on
the MUD. 

&amp;WArc of the Moon&amp;n: (defense and riposte) - A high, left to right
horizontal parry, designed to knock aside an incoming downward or
diagonal attack, followed immediately by a return slash aimed across
the throat from right to left. Can also be performed kneeling, in
which case counterslash aims for stomach or chest. 

&amp;WThe Bee Stings&amp;n: (Disarm) Twine your sword with your opponents, sliding
yours down his blade until your point pricks his hand, followed by a
quick snap of your weapon. Notes: Places you in close proximity to
your opponent. Should not be used during dual weapon combat. 

&amp;WThe Bell Rings&amp;n: Brute force disarm. Strike your opponent's weapon a
ringing blow, forcing it from from his grasp. Notes: Do not attempt
this against a stronger foe, or one with a two handed weapon. May
damage your own weapon as well as your opponent's. 

&amp;WBoar Rushes Down the Mountain&amp;n: (all-out attack) Rushing ahead with many
slashes and stabs, barreling and whirling. Generally, it seems like a
wild attack, but is quite well controlled. Notes: Used to press an
advantage, don't lose control. Countered by: Cat Dances on the Wall 

&amp;WBundling Straw&amp;n: (defense - counterattack) Sword held parallel to body,
point up, and moves horizontally across the body, used to parry.
Immediately after parrying, the sword slashes downward at the
attacker's stomach and legs, moving in the opposite direction as
before. 

&amp;WCat Dances on the Wall&amp;n: (defense) Walk forward and backward along an
imaginary wall, keeping feet in a straight line, parrying the whole
while. Each parry is supposed to be light and fast, only powerful
enough to sufficiently block the blow, to avoid tiring. This form
Counters: Boar Rushes Down the Mountain 

&amp;WCat on Hot Sand&amp;n: (defense) Leap to avoid an attack, parrying once to
meet a second attack. Move is left, right, and/or back, but never
forward, as forward motion can get you impaled. Combines the concepts
of dodging and parrying into one technique. This form is the counter
to Parting the Silk. 

&amp;WThe Creeper Embraces the Oak&amp;n: (close attack) Parry an incoming attack,
sending it to the left if right-handed or the right if left-handed.
Step forward, close to your opponent, and drop the hilt of your blade
to waist height so it's point up. Proceed to make an upward thrust
aimed to pierce beneath his chin, and then follow up with a draw cut
aimed down the chest. Repeat in alternating fashion if needed, or
disengage by stepping back into a guard position. Note: Good timing is
essential for success.

&amp;WDandelion in the Wind&amp;n: (evasion) - sway to avoid incoming thrusts to
the head or upper torso, moving to one side or another and stepping
backward to open distance between you and your opponent. 

&amp;WThe Falcon Stoops&amp;n: (counterattack) Though not a defense form, this is
commonly used after a parry as a counterattack. Start with a quick
fake to the side of the head (this should prevent the opponent from
moving closer or attacking) and immediately follow with a step forward
and a diagonal slash down the opponent's torso. 

&amp;WFolding the Fan&amp;n: (sheathing move) Flourishing sheathing move. Make it
as flowery and impressive as possible.

&amp;WThe Grapevine Twines&amp;n: (disarm) Tap opponent's blade (versus a thrust),
followed by leaning into opponent's sword arc, before the opponent can
recover from the tap, twine your sword with his, then snap your wrist.

      <description>&amp;GFlOW THEORY AND COMPARISON&amp;n

This is among the most involved lessons on the syllabus, and is one of
the most important. It will set the tone for the recipient's channeler
training for the rest of the time they are in the guild. This
information was taken from the old syllabus to promote consistency.
The lecture is divided into two parts: Flow Comparison, and Flow
Theory.

&amp;WFlow Comparison:&amp;n

&amp;R&amp;RFire&amp;n&amp;n/&amp;C&amp;CAir&amp;n&amp;n - common for masculine/ common for feminine, both are embodiments of the active principle. 
&amp;y&amp;yEarth&amp;n&amp;n/&amp;B&amp;BWater&amp;n&amp;n - masculine/feminine, these embody the passive
principle. 
&amp;W&amp;WSpirit&amp;n&amp;n - neither masculine nor feminine, this flow is capable of
taking an active, passive, or static role depending on its usage in a
weaving.

Each of the five flows has attributes which determine how it reacts
with the other flows. Aptitude with &amp;R&amp;RFire&amp;n&amp;n and &amp;yEarth&amp;n is more common in men, so we will refer to these flows as masculine. In general, the use
of &amp;BWater&amp;n and &amp;CAir&amp;n come more easily to women. We will label these as
feminine. &amp;RFire&amp;n and &amp;CAir&amp;n are more energetic flows, so will be 
referred to as active. They add the energy, be it heat, light or kinetic, 
to the weave. &amp;BWater&amp;n and &amp;yEarth&amp;n embody the passive principle. They 
provide the structure, cohesiveness and solidity. &amp;WSpirit&amp;n is not 
masculine or feminine. It also seems to function in an active or passive 
role, depending on what is needed. It also seems to function as a catalyst
or dampener for the effects of other flows.

Flow Theory:

&amp;RFire&amp;n - controls heat flow, and interacts with other flows as follows:

[&amp;CAir&amp;n] strengthens and adds to the active nature of the flow as outlined
in the comparison section. The two flows are complementary. &amp;RFire&amp;n can't
burn strongly without &amp;CAir&amp;n.  See applications elsewhere, in Fireball
lesson.  [&amp;yEarth&amp;n] produces tension/conflict when twined closely, 
becoming volatile and potentially explosive or destructive. This is because
both of them are masculine, but one is passive and one is active.
Therefore conflict and heat are the result. 
&amp;n 
[&amp;BWater&amp;n] produces tension/conflict, potentially resulting in possible
explosion or destruction. Once again, the conflict results from the
dichotomy between active and passive, with a different twist
originating from the presence of a male/female separation as well. 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] varying effects, depending on the weaving being attempted and
the flows present. 

&amp;CAir&amp;n - controls wind movements, can be used to manipulate things
physically with great ease... interactions as follows: 

[&amp;yEarth&amp;n] - conflicts vigorously, though perhaps not violently. 
[&amp;BWater&amp;n] - conflicts or supports depending on usage as both are
feminine, but one is active and one passive. 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] - again, varying effects 

&amp;yEarth&amp;n - manipulates solids, controls cohesion and disintegration...
interactions as follows: 

[&amp;BWater&amp;n] - Complementary flows, these can support one another 
[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] - varying effects

&amp;BWater&amp;n - manipulates liquids, controls cohesion and disintegration
(similar to &amp;yEarth&amp;n) 

[&amp;WSpirit&amp;n] - varying effects

&amp;WSpirit&amp;n - life force, manipulates other flows, dampens or heightens the
effects of other flows, and can be used for shielding,etc.

This information is most useful when improvising with the one power,
weaving things that are not specifically covered elsewhere in the
syllabus. It is especially useful for the Emote Channeling lesson.

The Black Tower exists to provide training to those that wish to
channel in the service of the Lord Dragon. The training is harsh
and rigorous with emphasis placed on results instead of intentions
The training walks the edge of safety, pushing hard. Occasionally men
burn out or die from being pushed too hard or fast. This is the major
risk of this method. The benefit is that in just a few months time the
Black Tower has become a force to be reckoned with.

The M'hael, Mazrim Taim, is the ultimate authority on the farm, having
been given that position by the Lord Dragon, himself. In the old 
tongue, M'hael is a word that simply means leader. His word is law and
can only be countermanded by the Lord Dragon. Second to the M'hael on
the farm is the Tsorovan'm'hael, or Storm Leader. Next comes the
Baijain'm'hael, which means Attack Leader. After this, in descending
order of rank are Asha'man, Dedicated and Soldiers. 

Regardless of rank, everyone trains every day. To increase the speed
with which one gains facility with the One Power, it is used for
everything. All chores are done using the Power. In fact, a recruit
will not be allowed a hot meal until he learns to use the Power to heat
it. In addition, time will be spent each day practicing with the sword
and with hand to hand fighting techniques. The ultimate goal of this
training is to produce finely honed weapons for the Lord Dragon to use
in his fight against the Shadow.

    <exdesc keyword="void">
      <description>&amp;GVOID&amp;n

Channeling Saidin requires much concentration. It is a constant
struggle requiring the wielder to remain focused. The flame and the
void is a technique for maintaining concentration and avoiding
distractions. It is almost a necessity for controlling Saidin.

In order to form the Void, one concentrates on imagining a flame in his
mind. He then concentrates on feeding his stray thoughts and emotions
into this flame until nothing is left but a void. This is difficult at
first, but with practice the void can be formed almost instantly. Some
of the effects of being in the void are the ability to avoid pain and
other distractions as well as a distinctive emotionless quality. When
someone is in the void, his voice will tend to be cold and flat,
although it is possible to overcome this with enough practice.

For some, the void can be a difficult thing to RP. It is generally
accepted on Fang that one should not put his thoughts and emotions into
his emotes. Since the flame and the void is purely a mental trick, this
presents some problems in RP. It is generally considered best to just
roleplay the effects of being in the void. Some examples:

&amp;cJoe's face goes slack and his eyes cold as he assumes the void. His
voice comes out cold and flat as he says,&quot;Seize Saidin, Dedicated.&quot;

Joe's face, blank from the void, does not register any sign of pain as
the sword tip sinks deeply into his thigh.&amp;n

An example of how not to do it:

&amp;cJoe forms an image of a bright flame in his mind and slowly feeds his
emotions and stray thoughts into it. An expression of calm gradually
comes over his face as the flame burns away all distractions, then
fades away leaving only the empty void.&amp;n

The previous example is not necessarily a bad emote. It just goes
against the commonly accepted standards for RP on fang. It is generally
accepted that one should not describe his thoughts, since the audience
has no way of knowing these things.

The examples of the right way are not necessarily perfect, either. Each
student should develope his own style that he is comfortable with. The
important things to portray is that one usually appears emotionless
when in the void and that he is able to ignore pain and other
distractions while still being aware of them.

    <exdesc keyword="grasp">
      <description>\c00&amp;GGRASP AND RELEASE&amp;n

Grasping and releasing the One Power is something a member of the Black
Tower will do very often. In fact, it will be done so often as to
become a very trivial part of your channeling emotes.

Once inside the void, one will notice a sort of shimmering or shining
just outside the void. This is Saidin. In order to grasp, one merely
reaches out with his mind and &quot;seizes&quot; this shining. Channeling Saidin
is a constant struggle. If one does not maintain control over it at all
times, he can find himself burned out or even killed. Saidin is not
very forgiving. This constant struggle to control the Power is one of
the reasons that it is incredibly dangerous to channel when fatigued.
This danger is further exacerbated by the fact that channeling itself
tends to fatigue one. It should be further noted that the taint lies
on Saidin like a foul oilslick. Each time one touches Saidin, he also
touches the taint. An example:

&amp;cJoe seizes Saidin, his mouth twisting slightly at the foulness of the
taint.&amp;n

There are many differences between the way a man channels and the way a
woman channels. We will only touch upon a few of them here. Whereas
women that channel can sense the ability in other women, a man can
only sense the ability in another man if that man is actually holding
the power. It takes a test to determine whether or not a man has the
ability to channel and this test requires his cooperation.

Additionally, female channelers will see a glow around another woman
that is holding the Power. Men are not surrounded by a glow when they
channel. Other male channelers will &quot;feel&quot; when a man is holding the power, but they will not see it, although they will see his weaves
when he channels. A male channeler can tell how much of the power
another man is holding by how strongly he senses it. One similarity
between Saidin and Saidar is the sweetness, the addictive quality.
Even through the foulness of the taint, the feeling of vitality and
joy associated with wielding Saidin is so strong that one is usually
loathe to release it.

&amp;cJoe holds onto Saidin. A feeling of menace rolls off him in waves
sensed only by other men that can channel and grows stronger as he
pulls more of the One Power into himself.&amp;n

In order to release the One Power, a man must force it away from
himself, as if pushing it. This is as much a struggle as grasping to
start with. Strangely, the Power can slip from one's grasp
accidentally. It requires effort to keep grasping as well as effort to
release in a controlled manner. Losing one's grasp accidentally
carries a slight risk of burning out. An example:

&amp;cWith effort, Joe pushes Saidin away from himself, the aura of menace
around him fading as the Power leaves him.&amp;n

    <exdesc keyword="five">
      <description>&amp;nThe five threads or powers of Saidin are Fire, Earth, Spirit, Water and
Air. This lesson is an introduction to these five threads, along with
basic uses.

Fire controls heat and light energy. It is one of the threads in which
men are more likely to have strength.  For uses, see &amp;Wread fire&amp;n.

Earth controls cohesion and movement in solids. It is another thread
that men are likely to have a knack for.  For uses, see &amp;Wread earth&amp;n.

Spirit deals directly with aspects of the One Power and the fabric of
reality. Men and women are supposedly equally likely to have facility
with Spirit. For uses, see &amp;Wread spirit&amp;n.

Water controls cohesion and manipulation of liquids. Women are more
likely to have Water as their strength.  For uses, see &amp;Wread water&amp;n.

Air controls kinetic energy and wind movement. Women are more likely to
have Air as their strength. For uses, see &amp;Wread air&amp;n.

      <description>&amp;GFIRE&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Fire thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WHeat&amp;n - thin flows of fire used to warm up something. Until this weave
is learned, the student eats his meals cold. An example: 

&amp;cJoe seizes Saidin and channels thin flows of fire into the basin of
water. After a very brief moment, steam begins to rise from the bowl.&amp;n

&amp;WFlame&amp;n - single thin flow of Fire with a twist or loop at the end to
concentrate the flow enough to induce a visible flame. An example:

&amp;cJoe holds out his hand, palm upwards, and channels a thin thread of
fire tightly twisted at the end. A small flame suddenly springs into
existance, dancing over his open hand.&amp;n

&amp;WTest&amp;n - uses the flame from the previous example to determine if a man
has the ability to channel. The subject must cooperate and concentrate
on the visible flame hovering over the testers hand. If the subject
can channel, after several moments the tester will feel something
similar to an echo from the subject. An example:

&amp;cJoe holds out his hand and channels, causing a small flame to dance
over his open palm. He instructs Bob to concentrate on the flame and
then cocks his head slightly as if listening for something. After
several moments, he nods slightly and lets the flame wink out. He
slowly lowers his hand to his side and says in a sad tone, &quot;You can
channel. May the Light protect you.&quot;&amp;n

&amp;WIgnite&amp;n - insert flow of Fire into target, and use to cause target to
burst into flames
 weave can be practiced up to equivalent of
firestorm code weave. An example: 

&amp;cJoe steps back from the fireplace and studies the wood stacked in it
for a moment. He seizes Saidin and channels, spinning out a thick
thread of Fire which he inserts into the largest log. He forces energy
into the wood and watches with a smug smile as it bursts into flame.&amp;n

As with any of the lessons, the student can request to have this taught
to him if he feels the need for extra explanation or training. The
Test weave is a special case in that if it is taught ICly, then the
student will be set with the gskill. He can also obtain the skill at
any time in this subrank by demonstrating to anyone with gskillset
ability that he has a firm grasp on the weave.

    <exdesc keyword="earth">
      <description>&amp;GEARTH&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Earth thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WShape Stone&amp;n -use flows of Earth to rearrange the composition of dirt or
stone so as to shape it without touching it or using a chisel or other
tool. An example: 

&amp;cJoe stares down at the slab of rock with what appears to be a dog's
footprint in the center of it. His nose wrinkles slightly from the
smell of brimstone. Seizing Saidin, he channels a thread of earth into
the stone and slowly smooths away the darkhound's track.&amp;n

&amp;WErupt&amp;n - use Earth to cause a fountain of displaced earth - directly
beneath your opponent or your opponent's horse. An example: 

&amp;cJoe stands his ground, an arrogant sneer on his face and his fists on
his hips as the lancer bears down on him. Suddenly he spins thick,
tightly twisted flows of earth into the ground just ahead of the
horseman and watches with grim satisfaction as displaced dirt and
stone fountain skyward. &amp;n
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="air">
      <description>&amp;GAIR&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Air thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WAirshield&amp;n - single flow of Air twisted into a tightly-spun plate of
steel-hard air to deflect a blow. An example: 

&amp;cJoe glares at the charging soldier, Saidin held ready. As the man makes
his double-handed overhead slash down at Joe, he spins a thread of air
into a steel-hard plate and interposes it between his head and the
descending blade to deflect the blow with a loud clang. &amp;n

&amp;WAirwall&amp;n - like Airshield, but more solid and tied off to allow it to
exist outside of the maker's control. An example: 

&amp;cJoe spins out thick flows of Air, weaving them tightly together to form
a solid, shimmering wall in front of him about five feet high and ten
feet across. &amp;n

&amp;WAirblow&amp;n - smack someone with a hardened flow of Air, be it as hard and
thick as a fist, or like a whip. An example: 

&amp;cJoe channels flow of Air into a club-like construct and directs it at
the insolent peasant, attempting to crack it across the base of his
skull. &amp;n

&amp;WBind&amp;n - use bands of Air to restrict someone's ability to move. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe spins out thick bands of air and tries to slip them around Bob in
an attempt to bind his arms to his sides and prevent his movement. &amp;n

&amp;WGag&amp;n - stuff the victim's mouth with a flow of Air so he can't talk. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe lets out a sigh of exasperation at the woman's ceasless babbling.
With an irritated sounding mutter, he channels a flow of air into a
hardened mass about half the size of his fist and attempts to stop up
her mouth with it. &amp;n

&amp;WDeaf&amp;n - block someone's ears with masses of hardened Air to impede
hearing. An example:

&amp;cJoe pauses his interrogation of the prisoner and wraps thick bands of
hardened air around him, blocking his ears. Then he turns to the
observing attack leader and says,&quot;Baijan'm'hael, I do not think he
knows anything.&quot; &amp;n

&amp;WLift&amp;n - bands of Air like Bind, used to lift the victim or target.
Difficult, and requires a lot of the One Power. The more weight you
lift, and the higher you lift it, the more of the Power you need. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe wraps flows of Air around the stone and slowly lifts it. As the
large rock climbs higher into the air, a frown of concentration
appears on Joe's face and the menace of Saidin becomes stronger around
him as he draws more deeply on the One Power. &amp;n
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="spirit">
      <description>&amp;GSPIRIT&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Spirit thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WDestroying Knots&amp;n - this consists of using flows of Spirit to knock/pick
apart the knot holding a weave in place. One method is to use the fine
thread of spirit to untie the knot, or pick it apart much like one
would use his fingernails on a knot in a piece of string. Another
method is to insert a thin thread of spirit inside the knot and &quot;flex&quot;
it, shattering the knot. Examples: 

&amp;cJoe examines the knotted weave for a moment, then seizes Saidin. He
spins out a very fine thread of Spirit and slowly worms it inside the
knot. Once it is fully inside, he puts more energy into the thread,
expanding it as if flexing a muscle hard. The knot shatters and the
weave it held unravels. 

Joe spins out a fine thread of Spirit and uses it to slowly pick apart
and untie the knot on the Airwall weave. As he finally works the knot
apart, he steps back with a triumphant grin and watch as the weave
fades away. &amp;n

&amp;WShield&amp;n - Flows of Spirit, heavily formed into an axe-like construct to
be slammed between the victim and saidin or at his connection to
saidin if he is grasping already. An example: 

&amp;cJoe channels thick flows of spirit into a wedge shape and attempts to
slam it between Bob and his connection to Saidin. &amp;n

&amp;WDelve&amp;n - Flows of Spirit used as a fine probe to determine the extent of
a patient's injuries. An example: 

&amp;cJoe places his hands on Bob's head and spins out fine flows of Spirit
to probe through his body to determine the exent of his injuries.&amp;n

      <description>&amp;GWATER&amp;n

The purpose of this lecture is to demonstrate some basic uses of the
Water thread of the One Power in a consistant manner such that our
weaves will have some uniformity. 

&amp;WDry&amp;n - use Water to remove moisture from your clothing/hair/etc. An
example: 

&amp;cJoe reaches down and grasps the girl's forearm and pulls her from the
puddle. Once she is again firmly on dry ground, he seizes Saidin. He
channels thin flows of water to direct the moisture in the girl's hair
and clothing, causing it to puddle up around her on the ground.&amp;n

&amp;WCall Water&amp;n - move water around with flows of Water. An example: 

&amp;cJoe spins a thick thread of Water into the fountain and forms a wave
which he slowly rocks back and forth causing water to splash out onto
the cobblestones. &amp;n

      <description>This lesson should cover every secondary detail about wielding and using the One Power.

Tying a Weave - Applicable to such weaves as shields, the channeler can tie the whole weave into knots, effectively cutting off the need for the channeler to maintain the flows for that weave. The weave will stay tied only for a time-depending on the strength of the weave and knot.

Splitting Flows - With training, Asha'man will learn to split their flows, through force of will. This allows for numerous weaves and complex weaves to be possible. 

Male vs. Female - Males are generally stronger in the One Power, adept at Fire and Earth. Women   generally tend to have more dexterity in weaving threads, adept at Air and Water.

Thread Affinity - Men and women of this age generally express innate ability in the usage of one or two threads of the One Power.
</description>

    <exdesc keyword="Beginner">
      <description>\c03Begin with an introduction to the five threads of the One Power. The thread's flows can be seen extending from the channeler's body, while the observer grasps, by color and feel. One flow from the five types can be channeled as of now, until they learn to split their flows at a later lesson. Have the students gain a feel for each weave, and have them channel each until they are comfortable.

Fire  - The orange-red of a flame, in color. Used for burning, explosions, and in complex weaves.

Earth - The healthy brown of the soil, in color. Used for construction, destruction, and in complex weaves.

Air  - The light blue of the sky overhead, in color. Used for weather control, air manipulation, and in complex weaves.

Water - The dark blue of the oceans, in color. Used for weather control, water manipulation, and in  complex weaves.        

Spirit - The color of the purest white, that seems to pulse of its own life. Used as a building block for many complex weaves, and also to shield from the One Power.

After lesson, a high-collared black coat and a black-handled blade are given. Assignment of chores is up to you, but must involve all use of the One Power. Student is hereby considered an Asha'man Soldier.

      <description>\c03[Heal] - Air, Water, and Spirit used to form a &quot;complex weave&quot; over the wound, to heal it. Both the strength of the healer and the one being healed are needed for this to work. People healed by men feel violated by a cold touch, and both are usually fatigued afterwards. The Asha'man's is a rather crude form.

[Shield] - A weave of pure Spirit, placed over a person to shield them from grasping the One Power, or cutting their connection to it. Much harder to shield a person already grasping, and depends on strength.

[Fireball] - A flow of Fire molded into a ball and covered in a shell of Air, which in then sparks the creation of an everyday fireball.

[Airwall] - A flow of Air expanded and meshed out into a wall in front of you, held together by a frame made of Spirit. Can slow projectiles and weapons, and rare cases stop them altogether.

[Airblow] - A strong flow of Air, enough Saidin to solidify it, and physically direct it at someone to bash, invisible to the eye.'

[Gate] - Weave flows of Spirit on one point in the air to physically punch a whole in the pattern to your destination. You must know the location you are gating from well, as in spending at least a twenty minutes there, observing your surroundings. You can gate to any place, even those you have not been to before, because you can recognize thread locations, which make up the pattern, even though you don't know the real place.

[Test] - The test weave itself is a small amount of Fire used to create a flame. The person looks into a candle or flame for ten to fifteen minutes while concentrating. If that person has the ability to learn how to channel, or has the spark, the tester will feel a resonance signifying that that person can become a channeler.

[Wrap] - Circlets of Air tightened around either the wrists, or ankles, or both. Through force of will, you can constrict the ability to move arm, leg, or both.   

[Sliceweave] - Intertwined Fire and Spirit threads aimed at another weave in an attempt to slice it apart, rendering it useless.

[Explode] - Intertwined Fire and Earth threads aimed at any object cause it to explode violently-including live targets.

    <exdesc keyword="Formlist">
      <description>\c03[Unfolding the Fan]: (defense) This is a circular parry. For a right-handed practitioner, the sword starts at about the 10 or 11 o'clock position and moves clockwise (a left handed practitioner starts at 1 or 2 o'clock). This parry, if properly timed, will knock away downward and diagonal attacks. It is best used in combination with other forms and maneuvers. Counters: Stones Falling Down the Mountain (either or both strikes).

[Kingfisher Takes a Silverback]: (low attack) A short, quick slash to the outside of the opponent's knee. The wrists instead of the arm should cause almost all of the sword's motion. This is a good maneuver to do as a counterattack, as the opponent's own motion makes the strike more harmful.

[Bundling Straw]: (defense - counterattack) Sword held parallel to body, point up, and moves horizontally across the body, used to parry. Immediately after parrying, the sword slashes downward at the attacker's stomach and legs, moving in the opposite direction as before.

[The Falcon Stoops]: (counterattack) Though not a defense form, this is commonly used after a parry as a counterattack. Start with a quick fake to the side of the head (this should prevent the opponent from moving closer or attacking) and immediately follow with a step forward and a diagonal slash down the opponent's torso.

[Parting the Silk]: (attack) Fast, strong horizontal cut (neck) followed by a downward diagonal slash (shoulder to opposite hip). First strike can be countered by a backward leap, but may leave open to second strike. Notes: This form can be countered by: Cat on Hot Sand.

[Cat on Hot Sand]: (defense) Leap around, parrying, one parry per hop. Move is left, right, and/or back, but never forward. (This can get you impaled) Notes: Keep moving. This form is the counter to Parting the Silk.

[Lizard in the Thornbush]: (opportunity attack) A lunging thrust to the opponent's throat, followed by a quick step back and a diagonal slash across the torso. Note: Commonly used against multiple opponents to take one of them out quickly.

[Stones Falling From the Cliff]: (surprise attack) - leap forward, making a single downward slash at your opponent's head, neck, or shoulders, employing your weight to power the blow.  Distance is of primary importance here, as you will be impaled on his blade if you are too close when you make the leap.

      <description>\c03Explain why and how they should be loyal to the Black Tower, and the consequences for not.

The Black Tower is a haven for male channelers coming from Caemlyn after finding their goal in the general amnesty, issued by Rand al'Thor. The Black Tower is a place of learning for all. By learning to channel, you can prevent death and the deaths of others through misuse of the One Power. With this gift, we ask two things: Loyalty to the Black Tower, and to serve as an army of channelers for Tarmon Gaidin, the Last Battle. Recruits should be taught to keep quiet about the Black Tower and its location, a
d to never betray it. Use of the institution of the &quot;M'Hael&quot; is acceptable as a tool of fear as far as consequences are concerned.

    <exdesc keyword="M'Hael">
      <description>\c03This is designed to mold recruits into M'Hael fanatics at their early stage of development. =)  

The M'Hael is the law of the Black Tower. He should inspire fear and respect. The history of the M'Hael, as false dragon Mazrim Taim, whom raised havoc in Saldaea. Rumored to be almost as powerful as the Dragon Reborn himself, and has the duty of training all of the Black Tower for the Last Battle.

    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="Wilder">
      <description>\c03Explain the differences between the two, and how being taught is justified due to safety (Untrained channelers are a danger). Also determine which of the two the learner is, and make sure he knows that.

Wilder - There are a very few who are born with the ability to touch the True Source whether they wish it or not, though even they require teaching to fully use their gift. These are called wilders. While normally stronger in potential strength than others, their ability without training is minimal, for some grasping a few times uncontrollably. For others, weaving a flow of the One Power. And for others, it could blend in to what you do, for example, Nynaeve unconsciously using the One Power to aid her wh
le she tends people as a Wisdom. Channeling without training is extremely dangerous to your health, and causes many side effects. A great many wilders have a block, which is a handicap in their ability to grasp, due to denying they can channel, or just plain bad luck. The block comes in may forms, such as only being able to grasp and channel when angry, or only when your eyes are closed. 

Latent Channelers - These make up the majority of the channeling populace, which in turn make up 3 to 4 percent of the general population. These men have the innate ability to be taught how to grasp, and then how to channel, but without assistance, will never come to know the powers bestowed upon them.

    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="Asha'man">
      <description>\c03The Asha'man were gathered together from places all over the world. Male channelers formed into a military unit, to be used as weapons in the Last Battle, under Rand al'Thor.

Asha'man, the name taken by followers of the Dragon Reborn, men who have come to what is now being called the Black Tower in order to learn how to channel. Some have dreamed of channeling despite all the dire risks, while others remain only because passing the test for the ability to learn has itself started them on the road to channeling, and they now must learn to control it before it kills them. They train not only in using the One Power, but also in the use of the sword and in fighting with hands and 
eet. Unlike Aes Sedai, who go to great lengths to make sure that those they train are not allowed to move dangerously fast, the Asha'man are pushed hard from the beginning, most especially in learning to use the Power as a weapon. It is expected that a certain number of Asha'man Soldiers will die or be burned out attempting to learn. 

Recruit is hereby known as a Student of the Black Tower, and is given physical chores to attend to.
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="Neutral">
      <description>Aes Sedai - Be it the ones loyal to Elaida, or the rebels hiding somewhere, the majority scorn us, and the Red Ajah, which purpose is to find and gentle all males. While you might think this certifies an act of aggression, no Aes Sedai is to be harmed by an Asha'man.

Whitecloaks - Believe using the One Power is usurping the Creator's will. Overzealous and arrogant. To be left alone.

Darkfriends - Any who worship and further the cause of the Dark is an enemy of a weapon of the Light. They reside in all societies of Randland. Some may have even corrupted our very ranks. The must be discovered and eliminated if we are to win.

Seanchan - They seek to invade our lands, enslave our peoples, considered hostiles. Come from a land across the Aryth Ocean.

Dragonsworn - Rabid band of poor farmers that follow a false prophet whom promotes foul deeds such as razzings and stealing. Considered hostile and should be loathed.

    <exdesc keyword="Saidin">
      <description>\c03Saidin is like pure water. Tainted Saidin is oil mixed with that water. Taint is an oil slick. Men tend to lose control due to the taint, either dying in one bout of madness, usually causing many deaths around him, or slowly wasting away from the inside, his body rotting. It is rumored the M'Hael uses wine to passively remove these victims. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="Void">
      <description>\c03To learn how to grasp Saidin, first Asha'man must learn the exercise known as the Flame and the Void, which is used to clear the mind, and focus on the trial at hand. 

To accomplish the void, the teacher must ask the student to clear his mind, and picture a flame in his head. When that has been done, he must attempt to form an effigy of his thoughts, emotions, and feelings, and &quot;throw&quot; them into the flames, and let the fires consume all, until nothing is left, except the blackness called the Void. To be realistic, this should take numerous tries until one can accomplish this. After the Void has been established, then the teacher may move on to grasping and releasing Sai
in. While in the Void, one is sensitive to Saidin's beckoning, which takes on the appearance and feel of a pale green light in the back of your mind. 

To grasp Saidin, the teacher must imbue the student with the fact that Saidin does not come easy; it is a battle of wills. To wrest the green light to you, which then feels like oil-slicked water, is to maintain an iron will, while in the comfort of the Void. Once you win control of Saidin, the feel of holding true Life in your hands, and holding ice and death, will happen, both at the same time. The oil-slick taint can be felt meshed with the water of Saidin. This is now called grasping Saidin. While gra
ping Saidin, sight and hearing abilities are both increased. Students should be taught nothing more in this lesson, except how to release Saidin. Once again, it is a battle of wills; the student must learn to force Saidin away, to the back of his mind, until safely letting go of it.

      <description>Explain why and how they should be loyal to the Black Tower, and the consequences for not.

The Black Tower is a haven for male channelers coming from Caemlyn after finding their goal in the general amnesty, issued by Rand al'Thor. The Black Tower is a place of learning for all. By learning to channel, you can prevent death and the deaths of others through misuse of the One Power. With this gift, we ask two things: Loyalty to the Black Tower, and to serve as an army of channelers for Tarmon Gaidin, the Last Battle. Recruits should be taught to keep quiet about the Black Tower and its location, a
d to never betray it. Use of the institution of the &quot;M'Hael&quot; is acceptable as a tool of fear as far as consequences are concerned.

The M'Hael is the law of the Black Tower. He should inspire fear and respect. The history of the M'Hael, as false dragon Mazrim Taim, whom raised havoc in Saldaea. Rumored to be almost as powerful as the Dragon Reborn himself, and has the duty of training all of the Black Tower for the Last Battle.

    <exdesc keyword="Asha'man">
      <description>\c00\c03The Asha'man were gathered together from places all over the world. Male channelers formed into a military unit, to be used as weapons in the Last Battle, under Rand al'Thor.

Asha'man, the name taken by followers of the Dragon Reborn, men who have come to what is now being called the Black Tower in order to learn how to channel. Some have dreamed of channeling despite all the dire risks, while others remain only because passing the test for the ability to learn has itself started them on the road to channeling, and they now must learn to control it before it kills them. They train not only in using the One Power, but also in the use of the sword and in fighting with hands and 
eet. Unlike Aes Sedai, who go to great lengths to make sure that those they train are not allowed to move dangerously fast, the Asha'man are pushed hard from the beginning, most especially in learning to use the Power as a weapon. It is expected that a certain number of Asha'man Soldiers will die or be burned out attempting to learn.

Recruit is hereby known as a Student of the Black Tower, and is given physical chores to attend to.

    <exdesc keyword="Wilder">
      <description>\c03Explain the differences between the two, and how being taught is justified due to safety (Untrained channelers are a danger). Also determine which of the two the learner is, and make sure he knows that.

Wilder - There are a very few who are born with the ability to touch the True Source whether they wish it or not, though even they require teaching to fully use their gift. These are called wilders. While normally stronger in potential strength than others, their ability without training is minimal, for some grasping a few times uncontrollably. For others, weaving a flow of the One Power. And for others, it could blend in to what you do, for example, Nynaeve unconsciously using the One Power to aid her wh
le she tends people as a Wisdom. Channeling without training is extremely dangerous to your health, and causes many side effects. A great many wilders have a block, which is a handicap in their ability to grasp, due to denying they can channel, or just plain bad luck. The block comes in may forms, such as only being able to grasp and channel when angry, or only when your eyes are closed. 

Latent Channelers - These make up the majority of the channeling populace, which in turn make up 3 to 4 percent of the general population. These men have the innate ability to be taught how to grasp, and then how to channel, but without assistance, will never come to know the powers bestowed upon them. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="neutral">
      <description>Aes Sedai - Be it the ones loyal to Elaida, or the rebels hiding somewhere, the majority scorn us, and the Red Ajah, which purpose is to find and gentle all males. While you might think this certifies an act of aggression, no Aes Sedai is to be harmed by an Asha'man.

Whitecloaks - Believe using the One Power is usurping the Creator's will. Overzealous and arrogant. To be left alone.

    <exdesc keyword="Void">
      <description>\c03To learn how to grasp Saidin, first Asha'man must learn the exercise known as the Flame and the Void, which is used to clear the mind, and focus on the trial at hand. 

To accomplish the void, the teacher must ask the student to clear his mind, and picture a flame in his head. When that has been done, he must attempt to form an effigy of his thoughts, emotions, and feelings, and &quot;throw&quot; them into the flames, and let the fires consume all, until nothing is left, except the blackness called the Void. To be realistic, this should take numerous tries until one can accomplish this. After the Void has been established, then the teacher may move on to grasping and releasing Sai
in. While in the Void, one is sensitive to Saidin's beckoning, which takes on the appearance and feel of a pale green light in the back of your mind. 

To grasp Saidin, the teacher must imbue the student with the fact that Saidin does not come easy; it is a battle of wills. To wrest the green light to you, which then feels like oil-slicked water, is to maintain an iron will, while in the comfort of the Void. Once you win control of Saidin, the feel of holding true Life in your hands, and holding ice and death, will happen, both at the same time. The oil-slick taint can be felt meshed with the water of Saidin. This is now called grasping Saidin. While gra
ping Saidin, sight and hearing abilities are both increased. Students should be taught nothing more in this lesson, except how to release Saidin. Once again, it is a battle of wills; the student must learn to force Saidin away, to the back of his mind, until safely letting go of it.

    <exdesc keyword="Beginner">
      <description>Begin with an introduction to the five threads of the One Power. The thread's flows can be seen extending from the channeler's body, while the observer grasps, by color and feel. One flow from the five types can be channeled as of now, until they learn to split their flows at a later lesson. Have the students gain a feel for each weave, and have them channel each until they are comfortable.

Fire  - The orange-red of a flame, in color. Used for burning, explosions, and in complex weaves.

Earth - The healthy brown of the soil, in color. Used for construction, destruction, and in complex weaves.

Air  - The light blue of the sky overhead, in color. Used for weather control, air manipulation, and in complex weaves.

Water - The dark blue of the oceans, in color. Used for weather control, water manipulation, and in  complex weaves.        

Spirit - The color of the purest white, that seems to pulse of its own life. Used as a building block for many complex weaves, and also to shield from the One Power.

----&gt; Draft into Asha'man [Soldier]. Assignment of Chores.

After last lesson, a high-collared black coat and a black-handled blade are given. Assignment of chores is up to you, but must involve all use of the One Power. Student is hereby considered an Asha'man Soldier.

    <exdesc keyword="Saidin">
      <description>Saidin is like pure water. Tainted Saidin is oil mixed with that water. Taint is an oil slick. Men tend to lose control due to the taint, either dying in one bout of madness, usually causing many deaths around him, or slowly wasting away from the inside, his body rotting. It is rumored the M'Hael uses wine to passively remove these victims. 
</description>
    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="Intermediate">
      <description>This lesson should cover every secondary detail about wielding and using the One Power.

Tying a Weave - Applicable to such weaves as shields, the channeler can tie the whole weave into knots, effectively cutting off the need for the channeler to maintain the flows for that weave. The weave will stay tied only for a time-depending on the strength of the weave and knot.

Splitting Flows - With training, Asha'man will learn to split their flows, through force of will. This allows for numerous weaves and complex weaves to be possible. 

Male vs. Female - Males are generally stronger in the One Power, adept at Fire and Earth. Women   generally tend to have more dexterity in weaving threads, adept at Air and Water.

Thread Affinity - Men and women of this age generally express innate ability in the usage of one or two threads of the One Power.

    <exdesc keyword="Heal">
      <description>Air, Water, and Spirit used to form a &quot;complex weave&quot; over the wound, to heal it. Both the strength of the healer and the one being healed are needed for this to work. People healed by men feel violated by a cold touch, and both are usually fatigued afterwards. The Asha'man's is a rather crude form.

    <exdesc keyword="Unfolding">
      <description>\c03[Unfolding the Fan]: (defense) This is a circular parry. For a right-handed practitioner, the sword starts at about the 10 or 11 o'clock position and moves clockwise (a left handed practitioner starts at 1 or 2 o'clock). This parry, if properly timed, will knock away downward and diagonal attacks. It is best used in combination with other forms and maneuvers. Counters: Stones Falling Down the Mountain (either or both strikes).

[Kingfisher Takes a Silverback]: (low attack) A short, quick slash to the outside of the opponent's knee. The wrists instead of the arm should cause almost all of the sword's motion. This is a good maneuver to do as a counterattack, as the opponent's own motion makes the strike more harmful.

These two forms are taught together because they are an example of forms put together to create a bigger attack, in this case a defense form, and then a counterattack form. 

In teaching the institution of blade forms, remember that they are only guides, and there to help.

    </exdesc>
    <exdesc keyword="Bundling">
      <description>\c03[Bundling Straw]: (defense - counterattack) Sword held parallel to body, point up, and moves horizontally across the body, used to parry. Immediately after parrying, the sword slashes downward at the attacker's stomach and legs, moving in the opposite direction as before.

[The Falcon Stoops]: (counterattack) Though not a defense form, this is commonly used after a parry as a counterattack. Start with a quick fake to the side of the head (this should prevent the opponent from moving closer or attacking) and immediately follow with a step forward and a diagonal slash down the opponent's torso.

    <description>A heartfelt apology lies here, hopeing to catch your eye.</description>
    <shortdesc>an apology</shortdesc>
    <actiondesc>I've never been very good at finding words.  Granted it is easier for
me in a place such as this than it would be were I to try to find them
in real life, but that's just because I can labor away at them until what
I have for the end result captures what it is I wish to say, and in the
exact tone I wish it to be stated.
&amp;n
Somehow I know that this won't be that easy.
&amp;n
Of all the things I've wished I could learn and come to understand in
this world is my heart.  Not the organ that beats within my chest, but
rather the part of me which feels.  The true heart.
&amp;n
Love and Hate, Jealousy and Affection, Concern and Apathy.  All of these
and more flow from this part that is within each of us.  Sometimes it
seems that they come with little or no warning, and with even less of a
reason.  I know, because I'm feeling something right now that I wish I
could just look at and say, &quot;Oh.  That's simple.  That's because ...&quot;
and everything would be in it's place.  Everything would make sense.
&amp;n
Of course, that won't happen.  It never does, nor do I feel it ever will.
That would make our time in this place less of a challenge.
&amp;n
Right now I'm feeling Fear.
&amp;n
Blood chilling, toe curling fear.  And to make matters worse, it's not a
single fear that I'm feeling, but multiple ones.  Crossing, and blending
as they course through my body.  My heart races, and tears well in my
eyes.  Each breath gets shorter in my lungs as I sit here, baffeled by
this inexplicable fear.
&amp;n
Slowly I sit and follow my emotions, tracing their quicksilver movements
through my body.  Trying to analyze every sensation or feeling as it
passes.  Fear, Trepidation, Sadness, Pain, Loss ... All stemming from
those twin fears that have been coursing through me this evening, and
still do even as I write this.
&amp;n
Why Fear?  Why can I feel fine... Completely normal one moment, and
the next be almost completely paralized by such fear?  Why am I
being plagued by this emotion?  There's no reason for it.
&amp;n
But that's a lie... I know it as I think it.
&amp;n
I fear myself.  My heart, the parts of me that are unkown and unknowable.
Those inner parts of me were emotions rage, uncontrollable by concious
thought or will power.  Unmeasurable by any scientific means.
&amp;n
I fear what I feel.  I fear how strongly such feelings will come,
and fear that I might not be able to control myself with such feelings
running through me.  Fear that I would lose myself, become someone else.
&amp;n
Someone other than the me who I am.  The me who stood before you and
called you Angel, smiling as you called me Demon.
&amp;n
And I discover the source of the other fear, twin to the first which
makes it's way through me in the same way.  It's a fear of looking into
your eyes and seeing that change in looks.  As you no longer look at me
and see me in that same way.  The light that dims from you eyes.
&amp;n
Which spurns on the fear of if it was ever there.  If not would it
have ever had the chance to spark and grow?
&amp;n
Or has everything else that's been flowing through my heart mearly
been a pipe dream?  A self delusion on such a scale as to be able
to freeze me in place, barely able to think for the fear that it might
be that way.
&amp;n
&amp;n
I offer this to you as an apology, and an explanation.  If you cannot
accept the former, at least I hope that you will understand the latter.
&amp;n
I've come to learn that no one can know their own heart. No matter
how hard you try to see every corner, from the limitless heights to
the bottomless depths things will remain unseen.
&amp;n
Even harder to see is the heart of someone else.  No matter how clsoe
they become, nor how far they open their heart to you, there will
always be even murkier depths in which lie the unknown.  One must
learn to trust in the other person to share with them what they know
and can see of their own hearts.

part of your heart that you've shared with me, and see a greater
unknown.  And I fear.
&amp;n
I do not even know if I should fear at this point we've reached, and
yet I do.
&amp;n
I hope that somewhere in the depths of your heart which seem so dark to me
You can find forgiveness for me.  However, if you cannot I understand.
Either way I hope that you take these words and at least find an
explanation.
&amp;n
With a deep abiding sorrow, sadness, and regret, I am sorry.
