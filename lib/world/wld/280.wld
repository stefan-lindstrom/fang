The street is paved with flat grey stones and the high stone wings of

Another road travels east, into the center of the city.
The Wall Road continues north and south for quite a ways.

      <roomdescription>This is the Eastern Gate of Aringill. Travelling west will take you onto
Aringill Street, through the center of town, and eventually exit on the
west side of the city. The actual East Gate has been boarded up and
several guards stand there to ensure people do not use it. Odd that
they will not let people exit that way, but they must have some reason.

with rotting boards and cobwebs from many spiders. A small engraving
can be seen in the south wall, but you aren&apos;t close enough to make
out what it says.

      <roomdescription>This used to be one of Aringill&apos;s shops, but it closed down due to lack
of customers. A faded sign on the wall reads- Fortuneteller.
If it had anything to do with Foretelling, that would explain the 
Dragon&apos;s Fang you saw scratched into the door when you were outside.

every type of horse. They range from colts to old horses and red to
black to gelding. A groom walks up to you and waits to see if
there is anything he can do for you.

      <roomdescription>You are standing in a large tower area. Signs saying to join the Legion
of the Dragon ( *-The best guild-* ) can be seen all over the place.
If you have come looking for a place to be your REAL self, this is the
place to do it. Please make sure you purge all remnants of OOC things
from your system before re-entering the city proper. The city
of Aringill thanks you for your cooperation.

are tied up here and sailors stand around carrying on conversations
about wind speeds and ocean currents. You hear someone say that
west of here is the main dock where boats can be chartered.
