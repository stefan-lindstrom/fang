      <roomdescription>On entering the Tower it becomes obvious that the walls inside are as
bright white as they are outside.  The floor, on the other hand, is
patterned by tiny tiles in different shades and tones representing each of
the seven Ajah&apos;s colors, arranged in an ornate patern that seems to run
throughout most of the Tower building.  South of this entryway lies a
huge, open hall - its greatness can only be guessed at, but from here the
domed, elaborately carved ceiling can be seen, amazingly held aloft
without a single pillar or support beam.  Many people are in the Hall,
common folk and hurrying girls in dresses of pristine &amp;Wwhite&amp;n.  Older girls
in dresses of &amp;Rr&amp;Ya&amp;Gi&amp;yn&amp;Wb&amp;bo&amp;Kw&amp;n-banded &amp;Kgrey&amp;n traverse the chamber too, and women
bearing the regal, ageless look of Aes Sedai - occasionally accompanied by
hard, stone-faced men.

see the whole of the Lobby, and the banners that decorate the walls in
colors representing each Ajah - &amp;RRed&amp;n, &amp;GGreen&amp;n, &amp;WWhite&amp;n, &amp;KGrey&amp;n, &amp;yBrown&amp;n, &amp;YYellow&amp;n and
even the absent &amp;bBlue&amp;n.  There&apos;s a monument here as old as the Tower itself
in honour of the legendary Elisane Tishar, founder of the Tower and the
first Amyrlin Seat.  The figure is such a familiar sight that most of the
Novices and Accepted hurrying past seldom give it more than a passing
glance.

      <roomdescription>This room is ornate, for it has belonged to generations of women who have
worn the stole.  A tall broad fireplace is built into one wall; fireplace
and hearth carved from &amp;Kg&amp;yo&amp;Yl&amp;Wd&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;n marble from distant Kandor, and the floor is
formed of polished, diamond shaped &amp;Rr&amp;re&amp;Rd&amp;Ks&amp;rt&amp;Ko&amp;rn&amp;Re&amp;n tiles, brought from the
Mountains of Mist.  Tall arched windows leading to a balcony, which
overlooks a small private garden, grace the wall opposite - although the
doors are seldom open.  The walls are panelled in &amp;Wp&amp;wa&amp;Wl&amp;we&amp;n stripped wood, hard
as iron and carved in the intricate shapes of fantastic beasts and birds.
These things have been in place since the room was first built, but each
Amyrlin brings furniture and decorations of her own - Elaida&apos;s writing
desk is immense, and before it sit a dozen &amp;ywooden&amp;n stools arranged in a
perfect semicircle.  The Amyrlin&apos;s throne-like chair is intricately
carved, and crested with an ivory &amp;WFlame of Tar Valon&amp;n, and above the
fireplace stands a sketched drawing of two men - one has a mouth and eyes
of flame, and the other is Rand al&apos;Thor.

cushions in front of it. Exactly opposite against the eastern wall
is a large, four postered bed made of cherry wood, its tops draped
with filmy burgundy silk. Near the head of the bed is a nightstand
of matching wood, holding a leatherbound journal and an oil lantern.
A soft, mauve colored, quilt covers the bed, along with burgundy
and mauve colored pillows. At the foot of the bed near the door
is an armoir that matches both the bed and the nightstand. The 
northern wall bears a fireplace of deep red stone, covering even
the floor just in front of it to prevent the carpet from being singed.

      <roomdescription>This room remains fairly bare apart from comfortable chairs and couches.
A weapons rack lies to one side, holding more than a few weapons, both
Gaidin and Sedai. Pillows line the chairs, and stuck auspiciously in
the middle of the room is a testimony to two Green Sisters said to be
the Archtype of their Ajah. One is the portrait of Caraighan Maconar,
the heroine of over one hundred adventures that are recorded in the 
White Tower Library. The other is a small statue in memory of Rashima
Kerenmosa, the Soldier Amyrlin who died with no fewer than 9 corpses
of dreadlords surrouding the bodies of herself and her five warders.

iron sits in it&apos;s center, surrounded by chairs of the same deep &amp;Kgrey&amp;n metal
polished to a dull gleam and softened with pale, plump cushions.  The back
wall holds a series of eight portraits, depicting each of the Amyrlin&apos;s
through history who have been raised from the Grey, the other two walls
decorated by framed copies of a number of successful treaties negotiated
by &amp;KGrey&amp;n Sisters.  Upon the floor in dark and light grey tiles lies the
ancient, almost forgotten symbol of the Aes Sedai, and, on a second
glance, the room seems peaceful rather than sparse.

overlooked where cleaning and dusting is concerned. Here only, will
you find rare documents left over from the Age of Legends. Here only

The branches of an ancient willow sag against the hard walls of

bone, and as novices sink elbow deep to scour layers of grime from the
dishes, others rinse the soapy pots and pans, then put them away.  In an
ever going cycle Laras, Mistress of the Kitchens, constantly calls for a
girl to fetch this or that, or sends girls over to heap yet more dirty
dishes onto the pile.  There is hardly time to think here, just the
endless array of pots and pans, cutlery and plates, baking tins and
breadboards that busy novices struggle to keep up with.

substance bubbles way, whitening up the greying or dirtiest of material.
Beneath the bubbling cauldrons are roaring fire pit&apos;s, kept burning by the

      <roomdescription>Inside the stable, the air is filled with the clean smell of fresh hay,
and healthy horses, barred light pouring in from the vents built into 
the roof of the barn. A long path runs down the middle of the barn,
between two rows of horse stalls, leading out to the fenced yard in
back. A man moves back and forth from a pile of hay in the back of
the barn to each of the stalls, cleaning out the old hay and replacing
it with new. Another man sits on a bench, oiling the leather straps
and bridles of the horses to keep them in good condition.

A wide ring of beaten ground runs around a large wooden pole mounted
deep into the soil. Attached to the pole is a sturdy length of rope,
to be tied to a horse while a trainer directs them to excercise. A
necessary requirement, as a Novice has no need for her mount until
either she is raised to Accepted, or dismissed from training.

The branches of an ancient willow sag against the hard walls of
the garden.  It could be a sad thing to see, it looks so old.  The
soil at the bottom of the trees, where the more eloquent plants
are kept, is very moist looking and seems to have been turned up
recently. The gardeners obviously take very diligent care of this 
garden, perhaps even receiving help from an Aes Sedai or two.

lined by flawlessly symmetrical &amp;mf&amp;Gl&amp;Wo&amp;Yw&amp;ge&amp;Cr&amp;Ws&amp;n of different colors in as many
shades as the eye can see.  The rest of the grove is just cleared ground

trees, &amp;yc&amp;ro&amp;yp&amp;rp&amp;ye&amp;rr&amp;n-tailed squirrels scamper, occasionally tempted to come
closer to the clearing when it&apos;s populated by only a few quiet visitors.

occasional Warders who pass by about their business, and a thick 
blanket of green grass extends to either side. To the north can be 
seen the tall hedge that shields the Warder Complex from the view 
of the novices lest they become distracted and neglect their studies.  
Faint sounds of wood on wood echo from that direction.  A few 
benches are in the area to the south that borders the garden, and 
they provide a pleasant area to rest.

      <roomdescription>The library is to the south of here at the end of a short cobblestone 
walkway that meanders between well-maintained flowerbeds.  A few 
steps lead up to the main door of the imposing structure, and on the 
threshold is a sturdy boot-scraper provided to keep mud and dirt out 
of the librarians&apos; hallowed preserves of books and parchments.  The 
entirety of this grand building is composed of shining white marble 
and reflects the sun&apos;s rays easily.  Eastward is a carefully 
maintained gravel path that leads off behind a screen of flowering 
shrubs.  A stray gust of wind brings a faint scent of horses.

the packed earth of a Stableyard.  Bales of hay are stacked in various 
places, along with a groaning wagon full of the combined efforts of the 
grooms and stable hands to keep the horses&apos; stalls within the stables 
clean.  A well is tucked neatly away in one corner to provide water to 
the facility, and a mounting block lies opposite it in the southwestern 
area of the yard.  There is another short path leading eastward from the 
yard to the east gate of the Tower grounds.

      <roomdescription>As you round the corner you see standing before you one of the 
largest buildings in the city, The Great Library of the Aes Sedai of
the White Tower of Tar Valon.  Constructed of marble, obsidian and
granite, both the splendor and the size of this immense structure
are second only to the grandeur and colossal size of the White
Tower itself.  The Great Library is renowned throughout the land as
the single greatest store of knowledge and information in the known
world. This majestic structure has vast storage space as well as
workrooms and offices.

forged by the Ogier Stonemasons of marble and granite, with a

the monumental structure above you and wonder for a twinkling
second what knowledge they possessed during the Age of Legends to
have built such a structure, and how much of that knowledge is really
housed within its walls.

standing four spans high and only slightly less broad.  During the day
they stand open to allow free entry to any of the Tower&apos;s residents, and
by night they&apos;re bolted shut, to protect the priceless objects inside.  
The foyer is huge, the floor made of &amp;rr&amp;wo&amp;Ws&amp;we&amp;R-&amp;Ws&amp;wh&amp;ro&amp;Wt&amp;n marble and the building
itself made with the same painstaking excellence employed by the Ogier
stonemasons who crafted the rest of the White Tower.  The library is very
much open-plan, and from the foyer you can see up to the second floor,
where the main body of books are kept.  &amp;KWrought iron&amp;n stairways stand both
east and west, and there&apos;s a desk here where borrowed books are signed in
and out.

scale - this room is less spacious, not quite as extravagantly presented
as the larger chamber.  Rather than a sunken tub theres a deep &amp;rc&amp;yo&amp;rp&amp;yp&amp;re&amp;yr&amp;n
bathtub resting before the stone fireplace, and on shelves against one
wall are piled towels and all the soaps and &amp;mp&amp;we&amp;gr&amp;wf&amp;mu&amp;gm&amp;me&amp;gd&amp;n oils a bather might
need.  On the back of the door hangs a hook holding a fluffy &amp;Wwhite&amp;n
bathrobe, and similar to through in the main chamber theres a low granite
bench nearby the tub.

      <roomdescription>Fluted columns of granite encircle the sunken tub thats placed in the
centre of the room in this spacious, steam filled chamber, the water kept
warm from glowing coals below the floor.  The tubs square, and large
enough for several people to share easily if needed.  &amp;KB&amp;wl&amp;Ka&amp;wc&amp;Kk&amp;n marble
polished like a reflecting mirror forms the floor, and one semi-circular
bench of polished &amp;Kgranite&amp;n flanks the bath.  A round window rimmed in &amp;Yg&amp;Wo&amp;Yl&amp;Wd&amp;n
bands like port holes of a ship grace two of the walls and overlook the
tower gardens below, but often the glass is misted with condensation too
thick for anybody to see through.  A large fireplace trimmed in polished
&amp;yb&amp;Yr&amp;ya&amp;Ys&amp;ys&amp;n lies along the furthest wall, and around the bath are &amp;ms&amp;gc&amp;Ke&amp;gn&amp;mt&amp;ge&amp;Kd&amp;n soaps,
sponges, bath oils, and a variety of &amp;ms&amp;gc&amp;Ke&amp;gn&amp;mt&amp;ge&amp;Kd&amp;n lotions.

high-placed alcoves carved into the stone, each holding a tiny glowing

hurrying about their chores.  Several of the girl&apos;s carry trays laden with
food, and others bundles of bedding and clothes headed for the washhouse.
There&apos;s a small back stairway here leading up towards the higher levels of
the Tower, a quicker route that bypasses the Lobby, and through the
always-open door to the east comes the scent of roasting meat and freshly
baked bread.  A door to the north leads outside, quite probably towards
the gardens, and westwards lies the laundry.

Lamps stand on tall stands around the room, casting flickering shadows on
the smooth stone walls.  In the very centre of the doom is a construct
made of three rounded, silver arches, each just tall enough to walk under,
sitting on a thick silver ring with their ends touching.  Silvery arches
and ring are all of one piece.  On a table nearby stands three large
silver chalices.

room you can see areas for all seven of the traditional Ajahs, although
the \c04Blue\c00 area seems somewhat ignored by the novices who dust
in here. About the stand are seven stone rings inlaid on the floor,

During a raising a member of each Ajah stands in their circle to witness
the making of a new Aes Sedai.

the tower gardens below, but often the glass is misted with condensation
too thickly for anybody to see through.  A large fireplace trimmed in

couch upholstered in a bright green and yellow flower pattern, as
well as a pair of matching chairs, with a low wooden table between.
Against the far wall is a small wooden desk, atop which rest some papers
and a few jars containing herbs, powers and pastes of some sort.  Above
the desk is a large picture window that, from this great height near the
top of the Tower, has a spectacular view of the city surrounding it. 
Next to the window is a bookshelf laden with more jars with varying
contents.
   The side wall turns a corner to form the other third of the room, a
small protrusion that is just big enough for a medium-sized bed covered
in plush quilts of a yellow fabric, as well as a wooden armoire and
nightstand.  Atop the stand is a glass oil lamp.  The room carries the
faint but pleasant odors of herbs and flowers, mingling in with the
airy look to create an atmosphere that is bright and cheery.

wall there is an ornate stone fireplace, wood resting in its hearth. Above the mantle
of the fireplace, high upon the wall, there is a mounted portrait of Katja Sedai with 
her Gaidin. Below is a small plaque reading: mother, her rock, her sword and her fire
(father). On either side of the large portrait there are charcoal drawings: one of 
Kalia with her twin brother, Silas, and the other of Kalia with Jeremiah, done right 
after they had been bonded.  Near the hearth is a fluffy green couch with a hand made 
quilt on its back, on the other wall is a painting of the woods, somewhere to the south,
signed simply Kalembar. Below, near the wall is a large four postered bed, thin, dark 
green silk draped around it.  Nearby you see an ornately carved dressing table with a 
soft seated wooden rocking chair in front of it. There are fresh roses in a vase upon 
another small table that bears a silver tea service as well, and a matching armoire 
nearby. Upon the wall above the dressing table you see a portrait of Kalia, smiling 
brightly with Ivlen standing at her side, her hand in his. Newly added to the main room
are hickory wood railings, and you can glimpse bronze ones around the tub, through the 
open door of the bathroom. Hidden in one of the corners of the room is a metal chair, 
bearing wheels and covered in supple dark green calfskin.

      <roomdescription>As you enter the room of a grey sister, you are overcome with the
feeling of peace and harmony.  The floor is tiled, but scattered 
throughout the room are delicately woven rugs of various luminous 
shades of grey.  The walls are hung with tapestries depicting great 
moments in the history of Aes Sedai, most with Kings and Queens 
kneeling to them.  The furniture has a sense of wealth, but also of 
simple elegance.  At one end of the large room is a work table, 
littered with papers, documents, books, pens and ink, and maps.  
Nearer to the bedroom you see a vanity table with combs and brushes 
neatly lined up.  The wardrobe is open and you can see dresses and 
gowns in every shade of grey and silver imaginable.  As you gaze into 
the bedroom, you see a large yet simple bad, adorned with silk 
blankets and beautiful pillows.  The whole room is very tasteful and 
elegant, much like its occupant.

Along the south wall a long sofa sits in front of a marble fireplace.
Porcelain figurines decorate the mantle. At the center of the mantle, a

bees wax candle in a \c10golden\c00 holder. There is a desk to your immediate
left. On it are countless books on healing and a large map of Caemlyn.
On the corner on the desk there is a half fulled ink well and a \c10yellow\c00 
feathered quill, both covered in ink. There is a rosy smell emanating 
from a incense burner lying on the desk. Behind the desk sits a rarity,
a ogier sung chair, gilded with various \c02trees\c00 and \c02plants\c00. A simple
rug of tairen weave lays on the floor composed of mostly \c10yellows\c00, \c11blues\c00

\c10golden\c00 colored hamster running in a wire made wheel inside a larger

with the scenery of a large, hunting party entering a forest. Directly
opposite the entryway is a huge window, giving a beautiful view of Tar

ledge. To the right of the window is a large bed, soft blue coverlets
rest on the bed with beautiful lilies embroidered into them. Opposite
the bed is the fireplace, which takes up a large portion of the wall.
The mantel above the fireplace has a few memorabilia, priceless looking
figures and statues intermixed with intricately carved golden candle
holders. Next to the fireplace rests a large, mahogany desk, shining
from the polishing it obviously receives. A few items rest on the desk,
papers and a flower filled vase, next to it lies a small, elegantly
sculpted dagger with a sapphire embedded in the hilt.

various swords, daggers, and other weapons are displayed against the stark
contrast of the bare white walls above the bed. The furniture is simple,
but high quality. A large wooden table placed in front of the window to
serve as a desk with a high-backed chair on one side and two more across
for it. A low bookcase, within easy reach, holds a variety of books on a
variety of topics, though some have no titles upon the spine. Various types
of paper and writing instruments are stored in cubbie holes and boxes on
top of the bookcase. Two leather chairs are placed in front of the
fireplace upon a large woven rug which appears to be an Aiel weave. The
large bed is placed across from the fireplace, with small bookcases,
holding even more books, on either side to serve as nighttables. It is a
four poster, but as with everything else starkly beautiful. The quilt adds
a splash color to the room, the colorful blocks of fabric spanning the

warm, glowing light pulls back the shadows to reveal two divided areas in the
spacious room. A dramatic linen curtain falls near the center to create the wall,
a fiercely glowing and soft red set among twisting strands of yellow, white,
blue, and green. 

The first section, nearest to you, is a comfortable looking sitting area with
cream colored walls, a hearth, and a pair of plush chairs before it. Bookshelves
line the walls and a masterfully stitched rug lies on the hardwood floor
beneath the table near the fireplace. Above it, there hangs an ornate tapestry
depicting a hawk in flight, whose wings have turned into flames, set upon a
background of dramatic blacks and whites. On the mantle itself, a silk scarf
lies draped and a small iron rose sits atop it, no doubt anchoring it but also
set on show for it&apos;s own merit. The table bears various objects of light creation,
whether candles or oil lamps, and set among them is a beautiful matching set
of instruments - lute and lyre placed side by side. A pair of swords hover in
hooks above the table, the blades both decorative and functional, though the
prominant one is noticeably better made. At the other end of the room there
sits a neatly kept desk adorned with several candles of it&apos;s own and another
chair rests before it.

On the other side of the scarlet veil, a dresser and armoire of rich wood rest
against the walls in compliment to the bedframe. The bed itself is also covered
with lengths of linen, draped from the four posts like a regal canopy, shielding
the sleeper from the eyes of the outside world. Beyond the bed, on the far wall,

noticably Tremalkin tea, a favorite of the Aes Sedai that inhabits this 
room. A high canopy of draped red curtains fringed with gold lace 
adorns the dark wood, four postered bed, sheets of white and lace lap 
over its sides all around. It is made to perfection. The small, dark wood 
desk enhances the east side of the room, parchment , a silver quill, and 
both red and black ink wells placed neatly on top. Before leaving, you 
notice a small doorway to the east side of the room. Curiosity draws 
you towards it, yet you hesitate...wondering what ward has been set 
around its hinges.

      <roomdescription>On the far wall you see a fireplace of thick stone, the hearth filled with
long burning hardwood, prepared for cold nights. Nearby you can see a soft,
plush couch, with fluffy pillows in each corner. A thick carpet the color 
goldenrod covers the floor. Pale yellow curtains lace the bay window that 
lies above a cushioned bench. Vases filled with wildflowers rest on shelves
throughout the room. Several books are on a small table near the four
postered bed. Lace curtains drape to hide the bed itself from direct view.
Overall the room looks well tended and comfortable.

      <roomdescription>A subtle elegance is initially established by the ceiling
to floor oak bookshelves that line the entire east wall, 
interrupted only by a \c23stone fireplace with an exquisite 
painting of Fal Dara hanging above it. A \c23pewter sconce hangs
on each side of the painting, creating a soft glow around 
it. The floor also appears to be of oak, although only the
edges are visible, as most of the floor is covered with a 
soft beige rug. Large wardrobes stand on either side of the
door. Their doors are painted very intricately with a detailed
maps of the Borderlands, the southern lands are also visible
although only countries and capitals are specified. In front
of the window at the north end of the room stands a large oak
desk, with a matching chair upholstered in a fine cream linen
sitting in front of it with a dark blue robe draped over it. 
An oversized four poster bed, appearing to have been built in
the room is covered with a soft \c23gray bedspread and large blue
pillows resting lengthwise against the west wall. Two large 
beige chairs separated by a small table sit at the end of the 
bed. A painting of three people hangs exactly above the small 
table, two are easily recognizable as Madeline and Kiel, while
the third is a bit of a mystery. The painting appears to represent
them in their late teens.

      <roomdescription>Within the shadows of this cool darkened room, one candle sits upon a long
smooth oak desk int he center of the room.  The candle glows with a
bright golden glow.  The window which once lay open to reveal the garden of
the White Tower has long since been enclosed by stone and now a large map of
the surrounding regions takes it&apos;s place.  In the far corner there is a feather
bed.  Wedged against the intersecting walls across from the bed, a large
oak closet holding Shanna&apos;s clothing and personal effects can be seen.  
Directly behind the desk, you can barely make out a large bookshelf filled with
books and parchments which have been neatly organized and placed in a
particular order.

instruments, bits of music and many books cover the shelves, a few
pieces placed out on a table near the window right next to a silver
music stand. In front of the window is a beautifully embroidered green
and gold window seat and looks like a very nice reading spot with just
enough light coming in the window during the day and a small lamp placed
on a stand nearby for reading at night.  A medium sized bed sits against
one corner, covered in a large cream and green quilt, light gold and
yellow embroidery decorating the edges. Thick, plush cream colored carpet
covers the entire floor, and comfy looking pillows and beanbags are
scattered all over one corner, just waiting for someone to lay down with
a book. Near the door is a small fireplace, with a tea kettle for
boiling water and a cabinet not far away seems to contain a selection
of various alcoholic drinks. The faint aromas of incense and freshly
brewed tea mix in the air, the flicker of numerous candles on a low 
table in the center of the room casting odd shadows about and adding
to the semi-mysterious, yet somehow relaxing atmosphere of the room.

Several shelves in particular seem methodically organised, and these

&amp;yye&amp;wl&amp;yl&amp;wow&amp;yi&amp;wn&amp;yg&amp;n scrolls.  Odd devices litter a bookcase near the far wall, in a
variety of shapes and sizes - most likely Ter&apos;angreal of a harmless
nature.  The floor is of the same &amp;Wg&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg&amp;W white&amp;n stone that makes up the
rest of the White Tower, although very little of its perfectly polished
surface can be seen - the books stacked on the floor leave visible only a
vague path towards the desk.  If there&apos;s a pattern on the walls it&apos;s
impossible to discern - almost every available section of wall space is
covered by maps showing countries both near and far, some even decorated
with tiny pins to mark important locations.  Light is provided by a large
window on the far wall, and the only actual decoration in the room is a

an inkwell or two, and a few steel nubbed pens.  Sealing wax joins the
general clutter.  The far corner of the room is dominated by a low bed,
the sheets perpetually mussed, and the room is fairly &amp;Kdark&amp;n - there are no
windows, but carvings in the white stone walls intended for globes of
light.  A thick carpet woven with a teardrop pattern muffles any
footfalls, and the lock on the door is shiny and bright - it looks fairly
