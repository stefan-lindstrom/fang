benches, it is mostly open space that the servants of the house
try to keep looking nice. It also serves as a place for the \c08guard\c00\c07 to
train, and the \c03stable master\c07 to exercise the horses.\c00

stables, which are home to \c14pure white mares\c00\c07 and \c23deep black

The boys who run around the area looking after the stables
almost trip you up as you walk around looking at the animals.

    <roombasic title="The Grand Foyer" vnum="6103" zone="61">
      <roomdescription>The floor of this room is made of smooth black and white marbled tiles, each
with a keystone and rose engraved in the center.  In the very center of the
room is a intricatly carved pedestal with a glass case on top.  Within the
glass you can see a deep red marbled keystone that looks very old.  Its curved
edges are worn, and there are small pieces of what could be old mortar on the
sides of it.  A rose is carved on the keystone, so that it is embossed out of
the center, rather than carved inward.  It is so seamlessly designed and
carved, it almost seems natural.  A small plaque beneath the case reveals that
this was the keystone over the main door of the very first Trakand manor, and
from this stone came the house&apos;s distinctive trademark.  Other pedestals dot
the large room, with various small items.  A old parchment reads of an ancient
treaty that was forged by a leader of House Trakand.  Another bears the crown
of the very first Trakand to sit on Andor&apos;s throne.  Several portraits also
grace the walls of this room, however these seem to be the only things within
this large room.  And the footsteps of people walking through, and their
whispers, can be heard echoing in the vault like ceiling of this foyer.  
Almost unnoticed with all the decorations, a stone staircase spirals to the
upper level.

    <roombasic title="The Summer Gardens" vnum="6106" zone="61">
      <roomdescription>Despite the heat, this garden seems to thrive.  Large red, yellow and white
blossoms can be seen throughout the mass of green vegetation.  A lush lawn of
grass spreads out on either side of a white marbled path.  Ivy and a climbing
plant that blooms small blueish flowers climbs across the walls of the Manor,
while red and white rose bushes are clustered in small circles.  Several large
oak trees spread their expansive branches creating areas of shade, while
smaller fruit trees occasionally dot the area.  A large white gazebo is
farther at one end of the gracefully curving path, while the other end splits
and wraps itself around the manor.  By the gazebo, in front of the largest
oak, are three small, though elegant, tombstones of polished black stone.  One
bears the name &quot;Samshadar&quot;, another &quot;Alaya&quot;, and the last marked simply
&quot;Friends we&apos;ve lost&quot;.  A small white rose has recently been laid at the base of
each.  A bronze sundail marks the passage of time in the center of the garden.
At night, candles in small glass globes light the garden wall and path, even in
the trees.

      <roomdescription>The large oak doors to this room reflect the rest of the room: simple but with
exquisite beauty.  A massive polished wood desk gleams from the farther end of
the room, its dark mohaganny exterior bearing few carvings or embellishments.
Yet it radiates a sense of respect and honor.  The top is very organized, with
a few papers in a small polished wood box at one of the corners.  A large
padded chair sits behind the desk, the armrests worn from decades of use.  
Dark green curtains frame a large bay window behind the desk, overlooking the
garden.  The folds have a velvety texture.  Two bookshelves dominate the side
to the left of the desk, and are filled with large volumes of historical works
detailing the history of Andor, and of House Trakand.  Across the room is a
medium sized black oak table, with maps and notes scattered about its top.  A
smoothly carved keystone paperweight hold all the notes down.  A portrait of an
older man is set above the table.  His graying features bear the traces of a
warrior, though his eyes seem calm and caring.  The caption reveals this is the
current Head of House Trakand.

      <roomdescription>This large room is dominated by two large tables that sit in the middle of it.
Separated by a gap of several feet, both have large maps inset into them, and
covered over with glass.  One table has a large map of the city of Caemlyn,
while the other has a large world map.  Small carved figures mark various other
groups, houses, and armies on both maps.  The walls of this room also have
large maps hanging on them.  Huge maps of Cairhien, Illian, and the Borderlands
dominate one side, while the other has large maps of sections of Andor.  The
musty smell of parchment fills the air, while a single small window looking out
over the gazebo lights the room.  A small door adjoins this room to a large
study.

suits of armor shine from the corners, while great swords and axes are
displayed proudly from tables.  There is a certain hallowed feel from all these
antique items, and with the many portraits that line the wall someone in this
room could feel as if they are being judged and weighed by those who have come
before.  And on a pedestal in the center of the room is a huge book that could
easily stand waist high on many men.  Within this book are all the names of
those who have served Trakand.  The names of some of the greatest heroes of the
house intermingled with the servants and the guards of those who have joined
Trakand.

      <roomdescription>The sound of \c12laughter\c00 and \c10joy\c00 continues to chime softly in the 
air. The pool deck stretches out below, its vast expanse of \c13p\c07u\c13r\c07e
\c13c\c07l\c13e\c07a\c13r\c00 waters filled with beautiful men and women of all races and 
ages. Alike they all appear half naked and athletic, frolicking 
merrily. The &amp;Gv&amp;ge&amp;Gi&amp;gn&amp;Ge&amp;gd &amp;Gm&amp;ga&amp;Gr&amp;gb&amp;Gl&amp;ge&amp;n balcony continues around above the pool
on all sides so some may watch with idle pleasure those below. A 
single \c08c\c01r\c08y\c01s\c08t\c01a\c08l\c00 staircase leads down to the \c11w\c04a\c11t\c04e\c11r\c04s\c00 edge and to the 
north the beginnings of a grand throne room can be seen.

protected in \c11v\c04e\c11l\c04v\c11e\c04t\c00. Each seems older than the next and many are written
in \c23harsh\c00, bold languages or long, flowing scripts. At the rooms centre 
stands a single &amp;Yg&amp;yi&amp;Yl&amp;yd&amp;Ye&amp;yd&amp;n writing table. Its edges are lined with wax, ink and
fine paper. Strangely to one side is a long line of seals as if many 
people of many more stations use this place to write their correspondence.
To the north can be seen a large &amp;Rc&amp;rr&amp;Ry&amp;rs&amp;Rt&amp;ra&amp;Rl&amp;rl&amp;Ri&amp;rn&amp;Re&amp;n staircase and to the east
a balcony of carved &amp;Gm&amp;ga&amp;Gr&amp;gb&amp;Gl&amp;ge&amp;n.

on worship. Everywhere you look there is perfection, not a bent
twig, nor a deformed leaf. Amazingly you cannot even find a flower
past its prime, there are buds and flowers in full bloom, but
not a wilted one anywhere.\c00

      <roomdescription>This enclave is dominated by a huge bed that lies in the center of the
room, directly under the highest point in the arched &amp;Yg&amp;yo&amp;Yl&amp;yd &amp;Ys&amp;yc&amp;Ya&amp;yl&amp;Ye&amp;n ceiling.
The four poster bed itself is concealed behind sheer \c14white silk\c00 that
hangs from the \c01rosewood\c00 frame. Large mirrors line the walls and golden
lampstands \c13i\c07l\c13l\c07u\c13m\c07i\c13n\c07e\c00 the chamber as light as day. The lush thick carpets
cover the floor and a \c03bamboo\c00 cage on the far side is filled with exotic
\c08b\c11i\c10r\c09d\c08s\c00 of rare and bold plumage. The slight smell of incense hangs in 
the air, only adding to the rich and \c12s\c05e\c12d\c05u\c12c\c05t\c12i\c05v\c12e\c00 appeal of the bedroom.

combed into perfect little rows which seems strange because the

about you playfully. The warm waters of the lake swirl
about you in a most pleasant, if unnatural way. Looking
down you notice that the bottom of the lake is quite
deep but you can see right through the \c13c\c00\c06r\c13y\c00\c06s\c13t\c00\c06a\c13l \c00\c06c\c13l\c00\c06e\c13a\c00\c06r\c06

perfectly into the \c02green earth.\c00
