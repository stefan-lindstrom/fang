A Dark Office~
The office is small and poorly lit.  A large, dusty desk sits in the middle
of the room and there is a large old leather and wood chair behind the desk.
There is little else in the room, but the desk is a mess of papers and there
is a mostly empty decanter sitting with a sticky looking glass.  The pale
amber liquid that fills the decanter glows slightly in the candle light.
