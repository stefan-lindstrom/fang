metal; tongs of all shapes and sizes, hammers, anvils and a large

around here, making metal items of various sizes and shapes,

A sign over a bench describes the services and pricing.

      <roomdescription>Here this small lane meets the inner city wall, which leads mostly
straight east and west here. To the west, a small grassy area opens up
from the meeting place here of three lanes into a park. The ground here
slopes upward to the south and a bit to the east as well, though the
crests of most of the hills here in the inner city are not terribly
high. The streets follow the curve of the hills naturally, affording views
of the parks and small neighborhoods from many angles. Much of what the
Ogiers originally built here still remains.Fairly far to the south, the
palace wall forms the southernmost border of the streets and lanes of the
inner city. The small streets here so close to the palace wind through small
hills and quaint, well-kept parks. Just to the south is a neighborhood of
small but prosperous homes.

      <roomdescription>Medium-sized trees border this street between the stone paving and the white
carved stones of the inner city wall.  The trees are fairly tall with very thin
trunks, making them difficult for an adult to climb; the lack of branches on
the low ends of these trunks make climbing difficult for a child.  The streets
follow the curve of the hills naturally, affording views of the parks and small
neighborhoods from many angles.  Much of what the Ogiers originally built here
still remains.  To the south and west, a smallish neighborhood made up of
mostly narrow homes and boarding houses wedges itself between two lanes that
travel generally north and south.  The neighborhood slopes up and down with the
ground's slight hills.

curving westward toward a small park at the end of the street, and southward to
eventually curve around one of the small neighborhoods that pop up here and
there in the inner city, the older part of Caemlyn.  The palace rises
majestically from the ground to the south, about level with the ground here,
although several small hills slope up and down between the palace and this
point.  The streets follow the curve of the hills naturally, affording views of
the parks and small neighborhoods from many angles.  Much of what the Ogiers

south via a small lane that winds around the narrow homes and shops in the
inner city of Caemlyn, the oldest part of the city.  The neighborhood sits just
against the inner city wall, just north of the eastern gated entrance into the
inner city from the rest of Caemlyn.  The streets follow the curve of the hills

appears to be a grey stone arch of some kind.  An aged peddler wanders down

refrains from being intrusive.

about equal size in an asymmetric intersection.  All of the streets here in the
smaller and older inner city of Caemlyn are paved with the same white stone,
similar in tint and texture to the streets in the rest of the city, though they
have a slightly different quality to them.  Perhaps it is the care that the
keepers of the streets have taken to retain the older quality of the area,
polishing the stones so that they are almost but not quite level, choosing a
slightly more grey tint, and sizing the stones in a seemingly random, yet
interlocking, assortment.  To the west, a small alley slopes down a hill into a
small neighborhood wedged between two lanes.

city is a maze of small lanes paved with an older greyish-white stone pattern.
The streets follow the curve of the hills naturally, affording views of the
parks and small neighborhoods from many angles.  Much of what the Ogiers
originally built here still remains.  As the palace wall curves to the south
and west, so does this wide lane, and it looks as though just around that curve
is a group of performers, singing and dancing as they tell a story.

      <roomdescription>This room has a rather frantic atmosphere, what with messengers running in and
out, oblivious to all except the front door, their destination in mind.  
Pigeons occasionally fly in a window to the side of the door and up a set of
side stairs that lead to the roof and that are caged off, though the bars are
wide enough that the pigeons can fly through easily.  Long wooden benches
against the far wall provide seating for those who are waiting for messages,
incoming or outgoing.  Though it looks chaotic, somehow all the messages get to
their intended recipient each and every day, with as few mistakes as can be
expected.

one of the most beautiful areas in the entire city.  People from all

      <roomdescription>This shaded balcony overlooks the western side of the grand city named
Caemlyn.  From the streets below, merchants voices carry up into the
air above.  The buildings that were built close together look almost
like a maze with it spreading as far as the eye can see, past the outer
gates of Caemlyn.  The balcony itself is decorated with several plants
growing from pots as well as the ivy vines that have twined itself on
the sides of the inn.

lays lazily in the center of the room.  With it's clean sheets, soft pillows

dresser with five drawers meant for storage.  There is also a large chest at
the foot of the bed, with engravings of a roaring lion etched into its frame.
To the right there is a large oak desk against the wall, with several small
cabinets and a polished mirror for dressing.  Close by, there is small
washstand and several towels to clean the dirt off any tired traveler.

chairs. The windows are small and sparse, giving the entire place a rather

and only whiskey is sold. No maids walk around in here to serve you.
There is one grim looking fellow standing behind the table to take

      <roomdescription>The endless, dusty motion of people moving along the Caemlyn Road
has receded to just a few villagers taking a walk at a far more
comfortable pace than the hurried, stressing pace that the
passers-by move by. It's rather obvious why the village has named
their only street White Road: the cobblestones are made of marble.

      <roomdescription>This is apparently the center of the village, the village well is here,
and several benches have been placed throught the cobbled square.
A very large, old oak stands in the northwest corner of the green,
and it seems to cope with the unusual weather fairly well. To the south,
the road to Far Madding starts, and to the north, the same road
winds its way back to Camelyn.

of every kind, from small figurines to one life-size horse. Some 
of the items are actually quite well made, looking very life like.
