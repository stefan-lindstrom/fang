      <roomdescription>Here in the center of the Tuatha&apos;an camp, Tinkers gather around
the fire for song, dance, and storytelling. Ringed by Tuatha&apos;an 
wagons, the clearing is alive with the laughter of children who
have not a care in the world. They dance through the \c03wildflower\c00
patches scattered about in the grass and scurry off to play on 
the large boulder visible to the southeast. Men and women in 
bright clothing gather wild herbs from the forest and add them
to the cookpot over the fire. The smell of the herbs, along with
the mouthwatering aroma of simmering vegetables and marinated 
meat, permeates the camp, setting young and old stomachs alike
to growling.

      <roomdescription>Scattered about the ground here are the cones of many different
kinds of trees, ranging from about the diameter of an Andoran gold
mark to as large as your arm and three times as thick. Several of
the larger cones have thorn-like extensions jutting out from each
of their cone segments. You look up cautiously, thinking to avoid
being injured should one of these fall from the sky. The branches 
of the trees here cross a well-worn trail to the northwest here, 
forcing you to push them out of your way as you follow it; the soft
hiss of a breeze also from the northwest softens the sound of your 
footsteps.

      <roomdescription>Feeling safe, a small rabbit ventures out of the bushes to investigate
a small patch of \c01red\c00 berries nearby. It rejects them and, suddenly
noticing your presence, darts back into the undergrowth. You hear it
scurrying away from you by the receding sound of twigs breaking and
leaves being rustled. Also noticing your presence, a crow sounds its 
call from the upper branches of a young evergreen. From somewhere within
the forest, a responding call can be heard, and then another, even 
more faint.

      <roomdescription>Some time ago, a medium-sized tree fell here, possibly due to a storm
or lightning strike. When it fell, it fell in one piece: there is no
stump left to sit on, just a depression in the ground where the roots
once took hold, now overgrown with grass and wildflowers. The tree still
lies here, now in a state of natural decay, thanks to the small insects
in Talain forest who run about on the log, decomposing it as you watch.
Touching the log gingerly, it shakes a bit and the insects move much
faster and in a more disorganized fashion for a minute or so, and then
continue with their work. Large footprints can be seen in the ground
leading to the tree if you look closely enough, indicating that a larger 
animal living in Talain forest feeds on these insects.

tallest reaches only about three spans into the sky. Though the
branches do not provide complete shade from the sun, the air is
slightly cooler here. Small cones lie on the ground, tangled in 
needles, indicating by their species that these trees will one day
be hundreds of paces tall. A small squirrel rushes by your feet, 
picking up a cone on its way.

      <roomdescription>Leda&apos;ali Pond is a lighter shade of \c06blue\c00 here, indicating shallower
waters. At first glance, the thin \c07silver\c00 flashes in the water appear 
to be a result of the ripples in the surface of the pond, but looking 
closer, you see that they are actually caused by small fish whose scales
reflect the sunlight as they turn underwater. The soft \c02green\c00 grass here 
comes right up to the waterline and continues in all other directions,
right to the edge of the forest to the south, which is too thick to 
walk through.

      <roomdescription>Across the pond to the northwest, you can faintly see an animal figure
with its head dipped, probably drinking the cool water. There is hardly
enough room here at the edge of the pond to walk, as the plant life is
quite thick and approaches to within a foot of the pond. In some places,
you have to step or even jump over clumps of plants with leaves that
shoot out from the ground in thin strips of dark \c02green\c00. The way appears
to clear somewhat to the southwest, but directly to the south Talain 
forest is so thick you can hardly see two paces into the area.

      <roomdescription>The sand under your feet is a moist dark brown color, interspersed with
small pebbles. The pebbles are mostly of a smooth \c23black\c00 or dark grey,
though some near the water&apos;s edge are a bit more rough than those that
have had years underwater to smooth out their surfaces. The water of
Leda&apos;ali Pond is crystal clear, so clear that you can see to the bottom
almost to the center of the pond. Apparently, no one has been swimming
here in quite some time, nor have any animals chosen this spot to drink.
Even the fish seem tranquil: you see a few here and there, most about as
long as your arm, all swimming slowly, not instinctively alarmed at your 
presence. The wind also seems to respect this place as a thinking spot: it
blows quietly, maintaining the utter silence that dominates here, save
for the occasional sounds of moving water.

      <roomdescription>Part of the edge of the pond here is formed by the roots of a large tree 
with a monstrously huge trunk. About a pace up from the ground, the trunk
splits into two parts, one part of which could actually be mistaken for an
extremely thick branch. While the larger trunk continues straight up into
the air, the smaller trunk bends with the weight of its branches, so much
that the tips of the \c02green\c00-\c22gray\c00 leaves hanging from the bottom branches
flirt with the surface of the pond. The ripples the leaves make spread out
in an intricate weave of ridges and refracted light that slowly fades as it
travels to the center of the pond. Those ripples that reach the edge of the
pond double back on each other, meeting in a gentle clash that can be faintly
heard by someone sitting on the grassy ground near the shore.

the pond as you step near its edge, frightening the insects skimming
across the surface of the water with the vibration of your footsteps.
Thin strips of grass push out from the surface of the shallowest parts
of the pond, causing tiny ripples that meet and form an intricate
pattern at the slightest hint of wind. The wind still comes in gusts
here, despite the surrounding trees, though the trees do serve to
lessen it somewhat, and the water cools it as it flows over the pond,
though the wind is still quite warm and insistent. Now and then a
small fish takes a bite at an insect on the surface, and looking 
closely, you can see several small schools in the water near you,
turning in synchronization away from you, as though they can feel
your eyes.

Light streams through the trees in a myriad of thin shards,
stabbing the earth with sun in a thousand different places.
Stepping back from it in observation, it looks as though there
is some sort of different world turning within those fine streams
of sunlight, or it seems as though there must be; the contrast
between that patch of ground and the ground you are on seems too
great for them to both be in the same place. Perhaps it is the
illumination. All too often lately it seems as though that is

causing it to spread out in spidery thin lines across the soft
ground. Stooping down to investigate a footprint in the soil, you
notice that the air near your feet is much cooler than the hot, dry
air that usually surrounds your upper body. The snap of a branch
some ways ahead of you alerts the body and mind; you relax somewhat
when you see the deer bounding east. This is actually a rare sight
so near to the edge of Talain forest: the larger animals usually 
keep to the northern part of the forest, where the air is cooler

side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature

From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small

dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it

a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of

peninsulas, allowing one to walk to their edges and sit on the soft,
moist ground and feel as though surrounded by water. The ground on
these peninsulas makes a moist squishing sound as your feet trod on
it, sinking a bit under your weight. The breeze carries leaves and
needles with it across your field of vision, dropping them on the
surface of the pond, adding to the morphous pattern that already
lies on its surface.

      <roomdescription>A medium fern-like plant protrudes from the ground here, offering
long, thin stems fringed with dark green leaves to the trail. One
side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature
has recently used it for a bed. Appropriate it seems, for the fern
looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps
you could even use some of the leaves as a collective blanket.
From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small
deer or medium-sized cat. You could look for tracks, but the thick
bed of pine needles that cover the ground make finding them quite
improbable, as you do not seem to have left any in your path.

a difficult life, working against the odds from the beginning,
trying to find light through layers upon layers of thick needles

old. It is an ecosystem where only the strongest young survive,
which is probably as it should be, and the forest is all the more
beautiful for it, even in these hot, dry times.

vaguely east. The rest of the pond stretches out to the east,
though the water stretches further west to the south of you. Here,
the shore is not really a shore like it is at other spots on the
water. Rather, the soft, grassy ground stops abruptly and drops
off about two feet before plunging into the water. The short
wall of earth is kept from eroding by a maze of roots and vines
that have embedded themselves into the soil. At various points
along the wall, some of the vines have sprouted tiny \c14white\c00 flowers,
some of which are bordered with whisps of \c05dark pink\c00 on their
small petals. The vines rarely climb over the wall to continue
their way on the ground at your feet, but rather resign themselves
to the vertical earth face of the wall right above the water.

The sounds, added to the sweet smell of fresh water mingling with

The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at
every point are much thinner here than at other places. The lack
of ground cover and the dampness of the ground makes for a set of
clear animal tracks, indicating that many animals of the forest
come to drink from this pool.

In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

been unnaturally cut off from its continued growth, having been
forced to make room for the pond itself. The thick intertwining
branches stand out in stark contrast to the glassy, transparent
surface of the pond. The abrupt edge to the forest&apos;s dense mass
and beginning of the clear air above the pond makes you somehow
feel as though standing in a capsule of a clear day, surrounded
by a thick fog that prevents any knowledge about events outside
your horizon, which is the forest itself. Sometimes it feels as
though your entire life unfolds itself this way, threading here
and there without your knowledge or consent, sometimes offering
an ephemeral moment of clarity before plunging you back into an
uncertain fog.

      <roomdescription>A thick forest wall holds itself up with the mass of its tangled
branches here, a few paces away from the shore of the pond, though
it is not certain whether it is trying to keep something out or
to hold something in. Whichever it is, the wall seems to cooperate
with the cool water of Leda&apos;ali Pond to keep much of the heat
scorching the rest of the world down to a minimum, though it seems
little could keep the hot, dry wind completely away. Here, though,
the day almost seems pleasantly cool; or at least you can make
yourself believe it is so by distracting yourself with the scenery.
If you sit quietly enough on one of the large rocks that are
scattered along the shore, you can sink into the surroundings and
begin to notice the animals at other spots on the shore, the birds
calling from above, and the fish snipping at insects on the pond&apos;s
surface. It is peaceful, so long as you are able to make yourself
believe that the rest of the world does not exist.

      <roomdescription>Scattered around the ground here are assorted piles of smooth, flat
stones. Some are the light gray of the typical rock, while the rest
range from a lighter granite white to a dark onyx black. All have a
common feature, though: their shape. While their diameters may vary,
each stone is thinner than an Andoran gold mark and as smooth as an
eggshell.  It seems a little strange that these stones would gather
themselves at this spot on the shore of the Leda&apos;ali Pond, tranquil
and aloof as it is now. A little strange, but still possible; and a
trail of concentric ripples spreading themselves out starts to lead
itself away from where you stand skipping these rocks across glassy
water to your heart&apos;s content.

      <roomdescription>A thin layer of dried leaves and dead needles covers the otherwise
grassy ground leading up to the shore of the pond here. For the
most part, the leaves are completely dead and mangled beyond the
shape of anything faintly resembling a leaf, but occasionally a
freshly fallen leaf shows a hint of color among the sun-faded
browns of the leaves and needles on the ground, so new to the
ground that it is only now getting a taste of what it is like to
be without its food source. If you were to come back here in a
few days, there would be new leaves on the ground, and the leaves
you see here that still cling to life would be merely another in
the crowd of mangled dead fibers. But you wouldn&apos;t notice; those
newer leaves would draw your attention, as these new leaves do
now.

      <roomdescription>The breeze is slightly cooler from the west here, and just to the
north you see a small stream of some sort, moving fast to the west.
The faint, liquid warbling sound it makes permeates the area with
an underlying feeling of movement toward something, though exactly
what the destination is is unclear. This small clearing, if it is
large enough to be called a clearing at all, is not exactly circular;
its shape is more elliptical, tapering off as it nears the stream
to the north. Yet still, it seems more a clearing the closer you
get to the ground - the branches of the trees overlap into the open
space, at times making it hard to walk without running into them.

they hurry only because they choose to, that truly they have not
a care in the world, and could break into song and dance at any

out of place when set against the dark greens, reds and browns of

a sort of bridge across a small brook that runs through here.

it is quite soft and could be nothing more than the warm breeze
pushing its way through the thick branches of the evergreens. Or it
could be an indication of a water source nearby, though it is so faint
that it is either rather small or quite far away. Small shoots of a
light green plant are pushing up valiantly from the needle-covered
soil, apparently seeking a drop or two of the sunlight that sweeps
its way across the forest floor in narrow beams of concentrated

Talain forest is quite alive here. Not only are the birds chirping

watching as her creations bake to perfection or preparing more goodies
on the large marble table next to the oven. Two assistants scurry about
the store making sure that everything is in its proper place, from time

their hand at a honeycake or batch of muffins. Two more large marble
tables parallel to either side wall double as cooling and display tables,

In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make

from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature

looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps

From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small

The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at
every point are much thinner here than at other places. The lack
of ground cover and the dampness of the ground makes for a set of
clear animal tracks, indicating that many animals of the forest
come to drink from this pool.

      <roomdescription>You see no overt signs of animal life here, though you can
certainly hear it. The birds&apos; cries form a cacophony of sounds
that occasionally seems to come together in a crescendo that
almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

      <roomdescription>A small near-circle of mossy ground peeks out from the mat of
pine needles that elsewhere covers the ground of Talain forest.
In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on
your own.

      <roomdescription>A tall tree stump sits here among the other trees, the rest
of the tree it supported either long since rotted away or 
carried off by someone to make materials suitable for building.
The stump is intriguing by itself, however: someone seems to
be using it as a canvas of sorts, a wood block to carve. About
a third of the stump is carved, whittled into the shape of a
bear cub, its unfinished paws blending into the wood, its
big eyes squinting and mouth open in a yawn as though it has
just woken up from a long sleep and is climbing out of the
log that housed it all these years. Wood chips are strewn
about the area, some of them fairly new-looking, evidence that
whoever is carving this cute little bear comes back regularly
to work on it. Perhaps it is one of the Tuatha&apos;an who often
camp in the area.

be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

      <roomdescription>A medium fern-like plant protrudes from the ground here, offering
long, thin stems fringed with dark green leaves to the trail. One
side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature
has recently used it for a bed. Appropriate it seems, for the fern
looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps
you could even use some of the leaves as a collective blanket.
From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small
deer or medium-sized cat. You could look for tracks, but the thick
bed of pine needles that cover the ground make finding them quite
improbable, as you do not seem to have left any in your path.

      <roomdescription>You see no overt signs of animal life here, though you can
certainly hear it. The birds&apos; cries form a cacophony of sounds
that occasionally seems to come together in a crescendo that
almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

that seems to cover the ground throughout Talain forest. They have
a difficult life, working against the odds from the beginning,
trying to find light through layers upon layers of thick needles
and shading leaves, vying for water among trees hundreds of years
old. It is an ecosystem where only the strongest young survive,
which is probably as it should be, and the forest is all the more
beautiful for it, even in these hot, dry times.

although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

clearing on the top of it, along with the collection of rocks that

a thick blanket of evergreen needles and leaves that covers the

the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch

      <roomdescription>Talain forest thickens increasingly to the west, north and south from
this place, but to the east, the sounds of people engaged in all sorts
of activities is quite loud, and several brightly painted wagons are
visible as well, indicating the Tuatha&apos;an, the travelling people. Even
in this spot, large wheel marks are plainly apparent in the soft ground.
The forest is still thick enough at this spot that the large ferns, trees
and various bushes provide enough cover that your presence is not obvious
to the Tinkers. It is quite apparent to the local wildlife, as several
birds in the trees chirp at a faster pace, and a small ground animal,
perhaps a squirrel, can be heard crashing through the undergrowth,
headed vaguely north.

      <roomdescription>A thin, well-worn dirt path traces a line from east to west through here,
on the edge of the Tuatha&apos;an camp. Not quite as bustling as the center
of camp to the east, this area is still full of people of all ages,
moving around the camp in a relaxed, easy manner. There is nothing very
abnormal about their walk or their conversation, but something about
them makes them look as if they could burst into song and dance at any
moment as they weave through the numerous wagons that are parked here.
The wagons are extremely eye-catching, their boxy frames painted in many
bright colors, in countless arrangements, no two wagons being the same.
One of the wagons, painted a pale green and trimmed with purple along its
windows and bottom, always seems to be busy with traffic of people who
carry small parcels or bundles of paper in and out of its entrance.

of you a massive granite boulder, easily climbable. It is a light 
\c07gray-white\c00, marbled with darker \c23gray\c00 streaks. All about you
children run around playfully, some climbing up the side of the 
boulder, some sliding down to scurry around the base of it. Small 
patches of \c03wildflowers\c00 grow here and there, and the children
somehow manage to avoid trampling them. To the west, the sounds

      <roomdescription>A small girl dashes past you and hops onto the slope of the
monstrous boulder looming to your west. As she scrambles up to
the top of the rock, you wonder how all the other children on
top of the rock escaped your notice as you approached this rock,
considering the noise level they have no problem maintaining.
Some of that noise seems to be coming from somewhere northwest
of the boulder: perhaps it is the camp of these children, whose
brightly colored clothing seems to indicate the Tuatha&apos;an.

      <roomdescription>A small near-circle of mossy ground peeks out from the mat of
pine needles that elsewhere covers the ground of Talain forest.
In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on
your own.

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it

a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of

      <roomdescription>Standing for a moment in the creek, something brushes past your
leg, something moving slightly off the fast-moving flow of water.
Though your legs are numbed somewhat, you did not imagine it. It
was probably nothing, just a leaf or a fish, and there are no fish
in this area that are poisonous or biting or in any way harmful
except for tasting rancid. Some of the fish known to inhabit the
waters of this area are in fact quite tasty, and if you could
catch a few your dinner would certainly be better than the
alternative, a handful of collected berries and the leaves of
some edible plants, and perhaps a rabbit, if you can catch one.

bone after just a moment of standing in the creek, but the sun
beating down upon the rest of you seems to counteract that. In
fact, the sun seems more interested in fighting the cold of the
creek than overheating your tired body. Alye&apos;ere creek has managed
to stay quite cold, as though it were a spring thaw, despite the
heat that has diffused itself over the land. Nothing to complain
about: it is a welcome respite, as has been the entirety of the
deeper forest, a break from the hot world into the cool, refreshing
innocence of nature.

In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

unique smell, yet familiar somehow, something you feel like you
should know, yet cannot quite place. Exploring could lead to the
answer to this mystery, though you have smelled it before and 
neglected to investigate. Probably it comes from one of those
patches of berries that you saw off to the side of your path as
you walked along in the forest. It must come from one of those
berry patches: cloudberries smell like that when crushed, but
nothing else that you know of.

      <roomdescription>At first glance upon the border between the forest and the meadow here,
it looks as though someone has erected a tall, invisible, and vaguely
circular wall around this meadow that prevents even branches from jutting
out over the slightly sloped ground. Perhaps it is an old wall, because
there are a few places where a solitary branch has broken through and
extended itself over the light, patchy green grass. In this part of the
meadow, the most southern part, and also the lowest by elevation, the
ground is quite moist, the grass greener than some places on the upper
slopes of the meadows. The ground slopes upward to the northwest,
seemingly preparing for the sharp upward grade that begins at the base
of the foothill about half a mile to the northwest.

be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

some places the wheel marks are deeper than others, indicating that a few
wagons park here when the Tinkers make their camp nearby. It is really an
ideal spot; the sound of water trickling a path through a brook can be
heard to the northeast. A person stopped here would be close enough to
the camp to join in any of the regular songs, dances, and stories that
the travellers take part in, and yet still be far enough away from it to

forest looks a little peculiar. The trees are quite spread
out except for a wall of trees to the east. There appears
to be no way to pass through this wall but for a small
space between the two biggest wall-trees. Even this
thoroughfare is guarded by two ferocious-looking yet docile
mastiffs. Peering through the gap in the tree wall, you can
see a small clearing, in the center of which stands a tall
tree which has carvings on one side of it. However, the tree

      <roomdescription>This small clearing is remarkably quiet for its location,
the middle of Talain forest. There are no birds or squirrels
in the oak tree in the center of the clearing, and there 
are no crickets in the grass, no flies buzzing about your
head. The only sounds you hear are the occasional calls of
a hawk somewhere in the sky and the gentle sway of oak
branches in the intermittent breeze. Once in a while other
Tinkers enter here and make conversation while carving their
messages into the bark of the ancient oak, which for many
generations has been used as the Tuatha&apos;an guild board due
to its resiliency and the quick regeneration of its outer
bark, a strange thing to find in any tree.

      <roomdescription>This is a tiny clearing in Talain forest, hardly large enough
to be called a clearing at all, nevertheless centered around
a small boulder slightly more than waist high. The boulder
looks unnatural somehow, but perhaps this is because of its
strangely symmetrical shape. Not only is it almost perfectly
round, it is ground at the top with a small concavity. This
concavity is full of water, reflecting a smooth silvery
surface that is only disturbed in small increments by the
skittering insects who have taken up residence at its edges.

itself apart from both the rest of the evergreens and the
blackened area to the northeast. Because of the thinness of
the trees to one side here, this area is brighter than the
majority of the deep forest. The bristlecone stump is a
little forest of its own, between the moss and lichens growing
on various parts of its surface and the insect life crawling
over the rest of it.

      <roomdescription>Stepping through the water, it is almost as though you have been
severed into two halves, both of which you can feel, but which are
so different that it seems as though you need to minds to control
them. Above the water line, the sun beats down unforgivingly on
any exposed skin already dried and cracked from the wind. Below
the water level, your skin tingles slightly as the feeling of the
first stages of numbness come upon you. The water seems cold enough
to numb your legs completely, and your toes are certainly already
there, but your legs seem to resist bravely, maintaining their
half-numb state, resisting any further loss of feeling but unable
to retreat back into their full sensory power.

dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

a tree shoots out from the ground at a strange angle, cutting into
the vertical space of the meadow, though it is not an unwelcome

do not seem to treat it differently than any other tree. It also has
the pleasant side effect of producing some shade in this open part of
the forest, and the grass directly underneath it is healthier on all
sides due to the break from direct sunlight. Despite its angle of
growth, the tree appears to be quite healthy.

      <roomdescription>Something about the air makes you feel as though there should
be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

      <roomdescription>A few small plants push up here and there from the thick pine bed
that seems to cover the ground throughout Talain forest. They have
a difficult life, working against the odds from the beginning,
trying to find light through layers upon layers of thick needles
and shading leaves, vying for water among trees hundreds of years
old. It is an ecosystem where only the strongest young survive,
which is probably as it should be, and the forest is all the more
beautiful for it, even in these hot, dry times.

      <roomdescription>\c00Upon entering the wagon, you step on a large dirt-brown mat woven from
dried grass. The walls and floor are a pale \c03yellow\c00, except for one of
the long walls, upon which is painted a breathtaking \c13seascape\c00, a view from
the top of a cliff that curves over onto the ceiling of the wagon. Without 
the illusion of open space that this mural provides, Alben&apos;s little shop
would seem quite cluttered. Small tables of various sizes and heights 
display the merchandise that Alben has collected from his many travels.
Sketches drawn from experiences on those travels adorn the other long wall
of the wagon. When he is not bustling around talking to customers about
the quality of his merchandise, Alben usually sits in a mahogany rocking
chair which he built himself and that sits next to a small unmarked door,
probably leading to Alben&apos;s living space.

there must be a plentitude of food in Talain forest, despite

is wildrose, but wildrose doesn&apos;t just grow in the middle of an

However, it must have been some time ago, because the wildrose

gruesome in telling the tale of a fire that reached that exact point
and was suddenly snuffed out. Thin black skeleton tree trunks jut out
from the soil at abnormal angles, continuing to the north for some

occasional finch or robin venturing into the burned area, singing its
song as brightly as ever, trying to lure the grass and wildflowers

dirt underneath disturbed by a nose or a paw. What the animal was

flecked with a few spots of a darker grey, with flat topsides, making
them seem the perfect two seats, and the stump perhaps a table. The
stump, however, is not totally flat, for it follows the slope of the
hill and is thus inclined slightly upwards to the northwest. Also, the
original tree was apparently felled by two separate axes, because the
top of the stump is bi-layered, the surface of it dropping off in its
middle to continue on to the other side of the stump at a slightly
lower (but relatively flat) level.

      <roomdescription>The vague path you have been following seems to disappear here,
although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

certainly hear it. The birds&apos; cries form a cacophony of sounds
that occasionally seems to come together in a crescendo that
almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

a nice, neat little box here. Actually it is a set of stables, which
blend into the forest as though they were meant to be here, an
unusually comfortable blend of civilisation and nature. These
must have been built by the Tuatha&apos;an who have recently made their
camp nearby; though perhaps not, as stables would tend to fix the

Either way, they appear to be active.

      <roomdescription>A medium fern-like plant protrudes from the ground here, offering
long, thin stems fringed with dark green leaves to the trail. One
side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature
has recently used it for a bed. Appropriate it seems, for the fern
looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps
you could even use some of the leaves as a collective blanket.
From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small
deer or medium-sized cat. You could look for tracks, but the thick
bed of pine needles that cover the ground make finding them quite
improbable, as you do not seem to have left any in your path.

still quite thick in diameter. Two lone branches near the top reach out
in opposite directions like arms spreading out to brace a heavy fall but
not reaching the ground soon enough to cushion anything. The &quot;arms&quot; lead
down to the bottom of the trunk and the blackened roots of the tree, still
in the ground, a stump that is easily two spans across its face, enough
for a man to lie down on and stretch out, with room to spare. Past the
stump to the east, more blackened trees stand, sometimes straight up in
the air, though more often at sharp angles to the ground, many of them
held up by thicker trees that stood more sturdily as the fire swept
through. Near the edge of the fire&apos;s destruction, though, regrowth takes
place at a rapid pace, bees buzzing and animals scurrying about under
your feet as thin, pale shoots of grass stick out awkwardly from the soil.

closer, this tree appears to have been the beginning of the fire that
burned the area around it. Not the tree itself, of course, but rather
the lightning that obviously struck it, splitting a trunk that once was
wider than two men are tall down the middle like a warm knife through
softened butter. Though much of the ground and trees around this one
have begun to recover, it is still completely charred. Black streaks
run along the ground from its roots and mark paths of dead soil that,
although surrounded with dirt that is healthy and nurturing, will not
support life for many years to come.

think twice about burning everything in its path to cinders. Blackened
branches obscure what little path that can be made, branches of all sizes,
shapes, and at all heights. The fallen branches connect those charred
trees that were left standing in a sinister three-dimensional maze of
towers separated by ladders and narrow beams. Some of the smaller branches
are so delicate that at the slightest touch, or even an unnatural breeze
caused by the passing of a person too close, they disintegrate into what
seems like a million pieces, floating to the ground and blending into the
dark soil, coating whatever greenery was trying to regenerate with a thin
layer of ash and soot.

      <roomdescription>Not too long ago, a fire ravaged this area, stretching its destructive
arms to the west and north, prevented from reaching more of the forest
by Alye&apos;ere Creek, which runs through here in a general north-south
direction. The smooth stones which are covered by the high waters of
the creek at the beginning of spring and in times that are less dry, are
tinted with dark soot, moreso on their western sides than on the sides
that face the creek. At the water line there is a seemingly permanent
dark line drawn on the rocks, from the ash that fell from the fire into
the creek and was pushed to the banks by the rushing current. The land
is obviously still not recovered from the fire, but the water and wildlife
of the creek appear not to notice; the water runs as clear as any forest
creek, and the fish and insects go merrily on their way through the area.

placed rocks and logs. You could stop and take a quick rest there,
and perhaps even step out of the water for a bit to sit underneath
the shade that a nearby oak offers. Strange to see an oak in what

part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing

pine needles that elsewhere covers the ground of Talain forest.
In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

unique smell, yet familiar somehow, something you feel like you
should know, yet cannot quite place. Exploring could lead to the
answer to this mystery, though you have smelled it before and

patches of berries that you saw off to the side of your path as
you walked along in the forest. It must come from one of those
berry patches: cloudberries smell like that when crushed, but

odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat

      <roomdescription>You see no overt signs of animal life here, though you can
certainly hear it. The birds&apos; cries form a cacophony of sounds
that occasionally seems to come together in a crescendo that
almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

      <roomdescription>Something about the air makes you feel as though there should
be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

      <roomdescription>All around here, small shoots of new trees not a year old spring up from
the ground, dwarfed by their parents, the charred spines of what once were
sprawling oaks and tall, thick evergreens. Those shoots that stand in the
shadows of the charred trunks seem resolved to push new growth into the
area, spreading leaves from tiny branches not half as thick as a finger.
Occasionally a young sapling will find itself covered in soot and ash from
a branch that was above it and disintegrated in a light sprinkle of rain
or a sudden harsh gust of dry wind, but another gust or another sprinkle
pushes the ash off the new growth just as soon as it fell. Birds chirp
as they fly through the area and sit on the tops of the dead trees, seeming
to be scouting for the other animals, inviting them in to help the forest
regrowth continue.

      <roomdescription>Perhaps it was a sudden rainstorm that came up to stop the fire, or a
quick change in the direction of the wind, but something halted a fire
that swept up from the north to this point, fairly suddenly. Blackened
soil turns slowly to the dark brown that it was meant to be as the eyes
move northwards, and the grass and flowers thicken from new, weary growth
to the lush, thick greens, reds, yellows, and pinks of plantlife that has
never seen a fire. The trees regain their branches, needles and leaves,
cones and acorns, though the south sides of the trees have a thin coating
of black ash on them. To the south, the darkened, thinned forest continues
for some distance, though a hint of green can be faintly made out on the
other side of it, through many spans of skeletal, charred trees.

      <roomdescription>The fire that swept through here came right up to the edge of the creek
before finally admitting defeat and dying down, leaving a blackened ruin
behind it to the west and south that the land is only beginning to recover
from. A piece of a charred branch is stuck in the water at this edge of
the creek, dwindling in size as the rushing water slowly separates parts
of the outer bark from the whole and carries it downstream. Small patches
of flowers and grass have appeared here and there on the soil, thinning
as they stretch farther from the moisture of the creek seeping through the
soil. Even in this dead area of the forest, many small animals scurry
about, seeming to clean things up cheerily, as if this is just another
part of the way of life in the forest, another task to complete, and soon
all will be bustling with life again.

logs on the east bank of the creek here. The water in this pool is
just as cold as the rest of the creek, though it moves much slower, 
a lazy circular pattern that recycles water from the pool to the
creek and back in an unhurried fashion. It is as though in this
small section of the pool, time simply passes more slowly. A large
drooping oak splits its huge trunk into two about two paces off
the ground, one of those continuing straight into the air and the
other curving to the west so that its branches fall over the creek
itself, providing the entire bank with a moist, inviting shade.

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

      <roomdescription>Off into the trees you see a few vines encircling one of the
larger trees in three equally spaced spirals up the trunk and
onto the bottom three branches. The vines themselves sprout small
\c08m\c14u\c10l\c09t\c13i\c11c\c12o\c14l\c09o\c10r\c12e\c08d\c00 flowers in a random spacing up the tree, leading one
to feel as though this is some idyllic fantasy world in which the
outside world does not exist, at least not the world you remember.
The heat of the Dark One&apos;s hand and the dryness of the world seems
to have no hold here, at least until you snap out of the flower-
induced dream and back into reality.

      <roomdescription>Some sort of crevice in the dirt is evident here, from the
indentation in the pine needles that cover the ground uniformly
throughout the forest. Perhaps this is some small channel for
the spring thaws that has been of no use in recent times due
to the weather, or perhaps the weather has dried up a spring
that used to run through here. Whichever it is, there is no more
water to be found here, though there must be a source somewhere:
all the plantlife here is much greener than you have seen it in
other parts of the world.

a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small

The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at

and thick, growing all the way to the edge of what occupies most of the
space in the clearing: an old fountain, no longer running, of smooth black
stone. The stone is heavily chipped and has been scratched by many a branch
and an animal claw, but the centerpiece of the fountain appeared to have
been a carving of a man. His facial features have been worn away by time,
and it is difficult to tell what he was originally wearing or holding, as
most of his limbs have broken off and probably make up the pebbles in the
fountain&apos;s basin. Still, his stance was not aggressive, and neither of
his arms appear to have been holding drawn weapons. Instead, the man is 
standing as though he both dominates and cooperates with his surroundings,
no matter what they may be. Now, they are the vines which trail up his legs
and the birds which make nest on top of his worn-down head.

In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

      <roomdescription>Something about the air makes you feel as though there should
be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

appears to be a spring-fed pool of water. This is one of several
you have seen throughout the forest, all of the same general shape.
The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at
every point are much thinner here than at other places. The lack
of ground cover and the dampness of the ground makes for a set of
clear animal tracks, indicating that many animals of the forest
come to drink from this pool.

contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the

sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing

should know, yet cannot quite place. Exploring could lead to the
answer to this mystery, though you have smelled it before and 
neglected to investigate. Probably it comes from one of those
patches of berries that you saw off to the side of your path as
you walked along in the forest. It must come from one of those
berry patches: cloudberries smell like that when crushed, but
nothing else that you know of.

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

      <roomdescription>Some sort of crevice in the dirt is evident here, from the
indentation in the pine needles that cover the ground uniformly
throughout the forest. Perhaps this is some small channel for
the spring thaws that has been of no use in recent times due
to the weather, or perhaps the weather has dried up a spring
that used to run through here. Whichever it is, there is no more
water to be found here, though there must be a source somewhere:
all the plantlife here is much greener than you have seen it in
other parts of the world.

that seems to cover the ground throughout Talain forest. They have
a difficult life, working against the odds from the beginning,
trying to find light through layers upon layers of thick needles
and shading leaves, vying for water among trees hundreds of years
old. It is an ecosystem where only the strongest young survive,
which is probably as it should be, and the forest is all the more
beautiful for it, even in these hot, dry times.

although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

this. You are isolated, alone, and surrounded by life. Finally
some time to be alone and enjoy the simple pleasure of the
wavy illusion of light through tree branches moving in the wind.
But truly alone; there is no one around here for leagues, except
that band of Tuatha&apos;an south of here. This is what it feels like
to be truly alone, not within arm&apos;s reach of civilization. Free,
but a bit frightening for most people.

forest is doing well otherwise, though, even if the loss of this
tree is a bit saddening, as it was rather old. Still, that is the
way of the pattern, replacing the old with the new, which will in
their time become old and ringed with many years, as was this tree.

comforting. Now that there seems to be no more rain in this hot,

In that small patch of exposed soft ground, you can barely make
out the tracks of a few animals who have crossed here anywhere
from months ago to extremely recently, you estimate. Thankfully,
the smaller tracks are the more recent, but in that small patch
you can make out the tracks of deer, bear, fox, and some other
animal whose tracks are so faint that either the animal is quite
light or it has not crossed here in some time. Those tracks are
of a fair size, probably nothing you would want to encounter on

      <roomdescription>The vague path you have been following seems to disappear here,
although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

from small enough to step over without tripping to too large to
see over. It seems to be a familiar place for the animals of the
forest. The boulders form a kind of semicircle, surrounding what
appears to be a spring-fed pool of water. This is one of several
you have seen throughout the forest, all of the same general shape.
The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at
every point are much thinner here than at other places. The lack
of ground cover and the dampness of the ground makes for a set of
clear animal tracks, indicating that many animals of the forest
come to drink from this pool.

      <roomdescription>A medium fern-like plant protrudes from the ground here, offering
long, thin stems fringed with dark green leaves to the trail. One
side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature
has recently used it for a bed. Appropriate it seems, for the fern
looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps
you could even use some of the leaves as a collective blanket.
From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small
deer or medium-sized cat. You could look for tracks, but the thick
bed of pine needles that cover the ground make finding them quite
improbable, as you do not seem to have left any in your path.

hill which has sloped more steeply than most places, and the
clearing on the top of it, along with the collection of rocks that

a thick blanket of evergreen needles and leaves that covers the

indentation in the pine needles that cover the ground uniformly

the spring thaws that has been of no use in recent times due
to the weather, or perhaps the weather has dried up a spring
that used to run through here. Whichever it is, there is no more
water to be found here, though there must be a source somewhere:
all the plantlife here is much greener than you have seen it in

      <roomdescription>Something about the air makes you feel as though there should
be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

most places in Talain Forest. Here is a place at the top of a
hill which has sloped more steeply than most places, and the
clearing on the top of it, along with the collection of rocks that
only increase its relative height, make it a perfect place from
which to observe the rest of the forest. Mostly trees, of course,
a thick blanket of evergreen needles and leaves that covers the
ground, but you can also faintly make out a large boulder which
appears to serve as a playplace for young children in bright colors,
and to the far northwest you think you can see a cabin near the
top of the slope, though it is hard to tell from this distance.

slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the

If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would

side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature
has recently used it for a bed. Appropriate it seems, for the fern
looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps
you could even use some of the leaves as a collective blanket.
From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small
deer or medium-sized cat. You could look for tracks, but the thick
bed of pine needles that cover the ground make finding them quite
improbable, as you do not seem to have left any in your path.

The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at

The heat of the Dark One&apos;s hand and the dryness of the world seems
to have no hold here, at least until you snap out of the flower-
induced dream and back into reality.

      <roomdescription>The forest slopes gently uphill toward the northwest here as in
most places in Talain Forest. Here is a place at the top of a
hill which has sloped more steeply than most places, and the
clearing on the top of it, along with the collection of rocks that
only increase its relative height, make it a perfect place from
which to observe the rest of the forest. Mostly trees, of course,
a thick blanket of evergreen needles and leaves that covers the
ground, but you can also faintly make out a large boulder which
appears to serve as a playplace for young children in bright colors,
and to the far northwest you think you can see a cabin near the
top of the slope, though it is hard to tell from this distance.

side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

of casting and letting the line float downstream for a time, then
casting again. Quite a lot of effort for one fish, though it might

      <roomdescription>You see no overt signs of animal life here, though you can
certainly hear it. The birds&apos; cries form a cacophony of sounds
that occasionally seems to come together in a crescendo that
almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

      <roomdescription>Something about the air makes you feel as though there should
be a body of water just around the corner. Amazing that you
should feel that considering how the weather has been lately:
dampness in the air is exceptionally rare these days. But still,
the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it
smells moist. Not only that, it is also a bit cooler than the
rest of the world seems to be in recent days. However, that is
a feeling that prevails throughout Talain Forest, so perhaps it
is just a property of the forest rather than an indication of
a creek or stream nearby.

      <roomdescription>Some sort of crevice in the dirt is evident here, from the
indentation in the pine needles that cover the ground uniformly
throughout the forest. Perhaps this is some small channel for
the spring thaws that has been of no use in recent times due
to the weather, or perhaps the weather has dried up a spring
that used to run through here. Whichever it is, there is no more
water to be found here, though there must be a source somewhere:
all the plantlife here is much greener than you have seen it in
other parts of the world.

      <roomdescription>The vague path you have been following seems to disappear here,
although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

most places in Talain Forest. Here is a place at the top of a
hill which has sloped more steeply than most places, and the
clearing on the top of it, along with the collection of rocks that
only increase its relative height, make it a perfect place from
which to observe the rest of the forest. Mostly trees, of course,
a thick blanket of evergreen needles and leaves that covers the
ground, but you can also faintly make out a large boulder which
appears to serve as a playplace for young children in bright colors,
and to the far northwest you think you can see a cabin near the
top of the slope, though it is hard to tell from this distance.

      <roomdescription>The rocky slope broadens a bit as it nears the top of what
appears to level out onto a cliff to the north. There is
some plant life to be found here, though it is somewhat
unlike the rest of Talain forest. It seems as though this
is a newer part of the forest, because the vegetation is in
general much more sparse, and what trees there are to be
found here are definitely younger than the majority of trees
in the rest of the forest to the south. A few hundred paces
to the north, however, the forest appears to resume its
usual thickness, and maybe even surpass it.

almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

Bending down to pick it up, you see that it is an old fish
hook, gleaming brass or some golden-colored metal.

fall into the creek below you, or onto a smaller strip of rock

long, thin stems fringed with dark green leaves to the trail. One
side of the bush is flattened somewhat, as though some creature
has recently used it for a bed. Appropriate it seems, for the fern
looks soft and thick; if you were to nestle yourself in, perhaps
you could even use some of the leaves as a collective blanket.
From the looks of it, the creature was probably some sort of small
deer or medium-sized cat. You could look for tracks, but the thick
bed of pine needles that cover the ground make finding them quite
improbable, as you do not seem to have left any in your path.

the feeling is there. The air does not exactly feel moist, it

      <roomdescription>Just upstream, to the north, you hear the roaring sound of a
waterfall as it cascades down into a medium-sized pool, the other
end of which spills over a large rock and down the hill to form
Alye&apos;ere Creek, the top part of which you are standing in now.
In fact you are getting rather wet; the mist from the waterfall
and the splashing from the pond spilling over the boulder right
in front of you is making every part of you wet, not just those
parts of you that are underwater.

      <roomdescription>The slope here of the rock is quite steep, and the roar of
rushing water grows in intensity the further north you climb.
The rock beneath your feet slick with a mist that seems to be
descending lightly from the air, in contrast to the usual
arid quality of the air. Not only that, but the actual area
of rock that you have to walk on is not wider than a man is
tall, and perhaps even narrower than that. It is quite
perilous, but at least the creek seems to be following your
slope: the danger here is not falling over the edge, but of
being swept away in frigid waters.

      <roomdescription>The slick walls of this narrow cave drip slowly with a milky
liquid that somehow seems less than strange in this altogether
different atmosphere within the hill. The cave slopes uphill
to the northwest, as does the rest of the hill. In fact this
cave appears to be nothing more than a shortcut through some
rocks, something carved out by time conveniently, making it
much easier to explore the upper regions of this hill without
having to risk lives climbing a near vertical rocky wall.

      <roomdescription>A cool breeze floats through the cave, becoming warmer as one
approaches the northern entrance to the cave not far to the
northwest. A small trickle of milky fluid travels down the
hill to the south near the eastern wall, and a few slithering
animals stop to drink the liquid as they crawl through this
place. Perhaps it is water, colored by the rocks somehow, but
the only way to tell that for sure would be to taste it, a
thing you are a bit apprehensive about doing. A rock face
juts out into the cave from the western wall, making a natural
seat of sorts, though it is a bit damp.

most places in Talain Forest. Here is a place at the top of a
hill which has sloped more steeply than most places, and the
clearing on the top of it, along with the collection of rocks that
only increase its relative height, make it a perfect place from
which to observe the rest of the forest. Mostly trees, of course,
a thick blanket of evergreen needles and leaves that covers the
ground, but you can also faintly make out a large boulder which
appears to serve as a playplace for young children in bright colors,
and to the far northwest you think you can see a cabin near the
top of the slope, though it is hard to tell from this distance.

The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome

      <roomdescription>Smaller ferns spring up around the base of the many trees in this
part of the forest. The light, lush green color of the fern leaves
contrasts with the dark reddish-brown of the tree bark and the
slightly lighter color of the mat of pine needles that covers the
forest floor. Looking up, you can just make out the clear blue
sky, which looks incredibly inviting considering your whereabouts.
If you were standing in the middle of a field perhaps you would
wish for the cool, shady cover of the trees and the damp, soothing
breeze, but for now it almost seems a bit too damp. The lack of
sunlight can be depressing at times, though mostly it is a welcome
break from the oppressive heat.

      <roomdescription>Several boulders of varying sizes are scattered about here, ranging
from small enough to step over without tripping to too large to
see over. It seems to be a familiar place for the animals of the
forest. The boulders form a kind of semicircle, surrounding what
appears to be a spring-fed pool of water. This is one of several
you have seen throughout the forest, all of the same general shape.
The pine needles that have covered the floor of Talain Forest at
every point are much thinner here than at other places. The lack
of ground cover and the dampness of the ground makes for a set of
clear animal tracks, indicating that many animals of the forest
come to drink from this pool.

      <roomdescription>\c00A slightly dusty smell permeates the air here, tickling your nose and 
tempting you with a sneeze, which would sound like an explosion in this
slightly eerie silence. An extremely thin layer of dust coats everything
in this room, giving it all an abandoned look. Otherwise, the room looks
fairly well-used. A dark brick fireplace on the western wall gives a 
splash of color to the bare walls yet still keeps with the earthen tones 
of the sparse furnishings. A cozy-looking brown leather chair and an 
oversized oak rocking chair sit about two paces away from each other, 
both facing the fire. Marking a centerpiece in the room is an oddly-shaped
rug, probably from the hide of some animal, that extends lengthwise from
directly in front of the fireplace almost to the opposite wall. A small
cast iron pot hangs over the cold ashes in the fireplace, with small bits
of dried food still inside, obviously left over from a crude washing.

      <roomdescription>This is a much smaller room than the cabin&apos;s central room, though the room
looks more compact than it actually is due to the shelves that jut out from
every wall and the large barrels stacked in seemingly random places. The dry
atmosphere is appropriate for a winter storeroom, which is what this appears
to be. This deep in the forest, the winters are surely harsh and without
respite, and this cabin seems well-stocked in preparation. Vegetables, dried
fruits, flour, sugar, and other necesseties line the shelves, while salted
meats hang from the ceiling. Two small, open bags of sawdust sit on opposite 
corners of the room, their purpose probably being to absorb any humidity that
threatens the preservation of the food. There is a dent in the bag closest to
the door leading to the central room, most likely from some accidental kick,
and small shreds of sawdust make a faint track around the room, tracing the
footsteps of someone as they walked about the storeroom, stopping in various 
places.

      <roomdescription>A slight breeze wafts in through an open window on the west wall of this
quaint bedroom. None of the windows have curtains; the walls, too, are bare.
Indeed, it seems as if this room was deliberately furnished to seem rough,
uncultivated. The bed is made of logs that have been left unfinished, one
of the bedposts trailing upwards to finish in a point with two dried leaves
dangling from a small branch. The logs seem to have been crudely tied
together as an afterthought, giving the bed a deceivingly rickety look: the
craftsmanship is actually of a high quality. A small stool, of the same
unfinished look as the bed, sits in the corner, showing off a seat made from
a thinly sliced tree trunk. The bedding is nothing more than a small pillow
and a rough woolen blanket which is barely large enough to cover the entire
mattress. Against the northern wall sits a small cedar chest, the shine
from its finish glinting from the sunlight streaming in from the windows.

      <roomdescription>The vague path you have been following seems to disappear here,
although it is true that it never really was a path at all, just
a line of clear space through the unending intertwining branches.
If it was a path it has ended: all around you except the way you
came are layers of those intertwining branches, at any and every
height, and where the branches do not cover large, thick cobwebs
are strung from between tree trunks too large for you to circle
your arms about. Here and there a bit of light sifts through the
myriad of needles above, and occasionally a cone from an evergreen
snaps from a branch and tumbles its way down to the ground,
rolling lazily along until it comes to rest a few feet from where
it fell.

piece of polished dark white marble flecked with a darker gray that matches
the smooth, perfectly curved stone walls. Two sets of large double doors of
dark wood face each other on opposite sides of the room. Four windows, of a
rectangular shape topped with pointed arches, and wide enough for a pair of
shoulders to fit through, are evenly spaced along the curved wall with each
other and with the two sets of doors. Each window is adorned with two pairs
of satin curtains, one bright red and the other a deep purplish-maroon. The
red curtains are drawn, while the purplish curtains are closed, showing off
their delicate gold embroidery. A throne sits between two of these windows,
made of the same deeply finished wood as the doors, carved intricately with
vines and flowers that seem to go on forever, even after the throne reaches
its peak after nearly ten feet. Large plush purple cushions cover its seat.\c00

It is quite large, but made in such a way that it does not dwarf its occupant.
It is covered with plush cushions of all shapes and sizes, most of them of

The other cushions were made to contrast these colors and to accentuate the
dark blue velvet cloak and blue-grey suit that the King usually wears.

satin curtains are drawn and held in place with golden cords. The dark
purplish-maroon curtains are closed, their vertical folds of satin both
reflecting and absorbing the light. The closed curtains are embroidered

the windows across from it onto the courtyard in back of the castle, a
lush green landscaped courtyard that continues until the forest begins off
in the distance. The window to the right of the King as he sits on his
throne shows a view of the inner castle yard, while the left window shows
the side courtyards of the castle and the royal bedroom windows.

      <description>The two sets of double doors stand opposite each other, identical in almost

throne is slightly ajar. They stand perhaps fifteen feet in height, made
of a thick, solid wood that has been carved with straight vertical grooves
except for a border two inches thick of carved vines on each door. The wood
is lacquered with a dark finish that shines softly in the sun.

be seen, even upon the closest inspection. In fact, the entire floor is
made of one slab of marble, with some continuous streaks that span across
the diameter of the room. There is not a speck of dirt - it is kept
highly polished.

of the room in a grand oval.

looking \c03o\c01r\c03a\c01n\c03g\c01e\c00 that seems to exactly match the haircolor of the
shopkeeper who wanders about, welcoming people to the festival and
bidding them a happy, peaceful farewell. A large copper pot hangs
from a stove that has been painted \c09green\c00, a green that almost
seems to give off its own light. The pot must contain something
delicious, because people seem to wander in with their noses first,
asking what the master of the wagon is cooking. Indeed, the smell

both the room and each other scurries about, asking visitors if
they would like a bit of refreshment to take with them as they
enter the festival, or a hearty meal before they leave to fetch
their horses or carts and return home after a long day&apos;s worth of
entertainment. Now and then young women who appear to be the man&apos;s

must lead to a kitchen, for the girls almost always come out of

the festival that is just outside, but some originates from the
various instruments set up for people to play here. Not only does
this wagon serve as one of the entrances and exits to the festival

encouraged to try out their possible purchases before deciding on
one of these lovely instruments, the wagon is filled with a jumble
of music that most often is nothing more than a tangle of notes
to make background music. Still, the occasional gleeman wanders
into this wagon and often ends up drawing a huge crowd, just by
practicing on a well-tuned lute or harp. The proprietors certainly
do not seem to mind, as they give a welcoming smile to all who

if he is wrong. Every booth and shop you see is bustling
with people.

      <roomdescription>Off to one side of the winding path through the festival
here, a crowded booth announces by its overhead sign that it
sells pots, pans and utensils, made by the Tuatha&apos;an. From
the sign and the ceiling of the booth hang all kinds of
cooking materials, made of almost every kind of metal
imaginible. Copper pots and kettles, steel spoons and ladles,
and heavy cast iron frying pans are only some of the items
that customers are walking out of the booth with. The vast
majority of them wear happy smiles on their faces, knowing
that Tuatha&apos;an metal work is widely known for its quality
and sturdiness. Opposite the crowded booth is a small stand
that is hardly less crowded. Here a man announces to all who
walk by that just a toss of one of these light little balls
into one of these huge buckets will win a huge prize. Many
are trying the seemingly easy task, but it seems as though
all of the balls tossed in just bounce right back out, as
though propelled by something unseen.

      <roomdescription>A kind of sickly sweet smell floats through the air here,
wafting through the area from the tabac shop in a booth off
to one side of the sawdust-covered path through the outer
ring of the festival. The Tuatha&apos;an merchant in this booth
has managed to get his hands on tabac from all over, with a
wide variety of flavor and price, though all of the finest
quality available for the region from which they came. Along
the walls of the booth, pipes of all shapes and sizes are
hung on display, many of which are unique in their designs
and carvings, the shopkeeper having carved them himself. He
sits in a rocking chair carved intricately with leaves in the
corner of his booth, watching the customers with a pleased
eye, pipe in mouth, laugh always ready. In the booth opposite
his, a heavyset woman with a kind smile and a motherly look
watches over the many children who drag their parents to her
booth, to look over a tiny puppy or kitten, begging them to buy it so they can take it home.

      <roomdescription>A large booth off to the side here houses a great many large
clocks, made by the same Tuatha&apos;an family for generations of
travelling, searching for the song. The search, of course, is
the primary task which all Tuatha&apos;an devote their life to, but
this family manages to make quite a living on the side, selling
their clocks to well-to-do innkeepers and rich merchants. The
large crowd there is gathered mainly to admire the work and not
to buy, but one customer in a thousand is all the family needs
to turn a profit for the day. The booth opposite the clock shop
is slightly smaller and more colorful. A brightly painted sign
hangs over a red awning announcing this to be a jewelry shop.
It is quite busy and appears to sell trinkets of all sorts,
from bracelets and necklaces well-made but of inexpensive raw
materials, to fine ivory and onyx bracelets and necklaces and
ruby and sapphire rings and pins. The crowd inside the booth
is just as varied as the merchandise.

      <roomdescription>Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I&apos;ve tasted of desire,
I hold with those who favor fire.

But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To know that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

      <roomdescription>A pair of wooden slotted swinging half-doors lead from the
rest of the festival to this small stable and fenced in
area for children to pet and play with docile animals like
goats, sheep, and tiny calves, for just a small price from
the parents. While the children play, the stablemaster
leads the adults through his stables, showing off his fine
array of horses and other animals, noting that all the
animals that the children are playing with are also for
sale, &quot;just in case the little tyke takes a likin&apos; to one.&quot;
Most of the animals are in good condition, though there are
a few among the pick that appear to be top quality, though
the stablemaster seems to know it, for the price he asks.
Chickens and roosters wander freely throughout the area,
occasionally wandering out the half-door or into the wagon
that makes up the back wall of the stable, always coming
right back to the stable, either after seeing the crowd
outside or the shopkeeper inside.

      <roomdescription>Several small circular tables sit outside a rather large
booth here, all intricately molded ironwork, painted in
extremely bright hues of \c12purple\c00, \c10yellow\c00, \c08red\c00, \c11blue\c00, and
just about every other color imaginable. Many of them are
occupied by couples wishing to sit and relax and sip cold
lemonade or strawberry fizz, or by parents needing a break,
sitting and watching their children play nearby. Two fairly
young girls in \c14b\c10r\c09i\c08g\c13h\c12t\c11l\c14y \c09c\c13o\c10l\c08o\c11r\c12e\c14d\c00 Tuatha&apos;an clothing wander
through the tables, asking if their customers would like
perhaps something more to drink or a small bite to eat, and
once having taken an order scurry back into the kitchen of
the wagon parked here, whose awning covers the back half of
the tables in shade. This is really an ideal spot for those
who want to get away from the crowd; from here, it is still
possible to see the main performance stage off to the south.

      <roomdescription>This small booth has its own large crowd around it, separate
from the crowd surrounding the center stage to the west. The
audience here is mostly men, though men of all ages, all of
whom have gathered around here to watch the Tuatha&apos;an girls
performing the Tiganza, that famous dance of undulating hips
and seductive moves. The girls do not dance on a stage, but
rather move about on the level of the crowd, frequently dancing
through the crowd or around some man who ends up blushing
furiously, no matter what the age. Quite often, a young couple
walking by will both stop to see what the crowd is watching,
but the girl always ends up fiercely tugging the boy away, to
some &quot;safer&quot; place, the boy blushing and swearing that he was
merely admiring the cut of the coat of the man in front of them
or the pipe in his hands, only to receive a fierce tongue-lashing.
Indeed, the only men who seem unaffected by the Tiganza are the
Tuatha&apos;an musicians who set the tone of the dance itself.

painted \c11bright blue\c00 and sewn with patches of \c09green\c00 and \c08o\c10r\c08a\c10n\c08g\c10e\c00.
A \c10yellow\c00 curtain is tied back from the large entry, showing
a room decorated in dark \c04blue\c00 and painted with \c14s\c00i\c14l\c00v\c14e\c00r stars.
Inside it, a young woman dressed in baggy clothes, her hair
pulled up to reveal large hooped wooden earrings lacquered in
a variety of colors. Around her neck is tied a blue and grey
patterned handkerchief, and she sits at a large table in the
middle of the room, in the center of which sits a transparent
\c14c\c00\c07r\c14y\c00\c07s\c14t\c00\c07a\c14l\c00 ball. For just a few coppers, this girl would be more
than happy to tell you your future, or give you advice on how
to act, answering questions about your life with incredible
accuracy. Her alluring smile and deep, throaty voice attract
many to her table.

      <roomdescription>Here, just out of range of the central stage to the east,
a small straw-covered clearing lined by benches marks a
smaller performing area. Here is where many Tuatha&apos;an set
up to do tricks, sing songs, and in general do many of the
things that gleemen do, though they modestly profess to be
not nearly as talented as those with the patched cloaks.
Here, as everywhere in the festival, Tuatha&apos;an girls and
boys in \c14b\c10r\c09i\c08g\c13h\c12t\c11l\c14y \c09c\c13o\c10l\c08o\c11r\c12e\c14d\c00 clothing circulate, offering food
and drink. Many of the younger Tuatha&apos;an are also crowded
around here watching their master performer, Jored, hoping
someday to learn his tricks and be able to perform as he
does, doing incredible acrobatic flips and turns, eating
fire and performing magic tricks, delighting young and old.
Quite often the applause from this small &quot;stage&quot; attracts
people from the center stage, where the crowd is also quite
large.

the ground about waist-high and measuring about ten paces
in diameter. This is obviously the centerpoint of the
entire festival, where the gleemen come to tell stories,
sing songs, and perform tricks, and where various groups
of acrobats or musicians come to show off their talents,
each placing a hat or a dish at the edge of the stage in
various places to collect coins from the audience. Men and

      <roomdescription>Upon entering the wagon you are overwhelmed with the bright toys that
line the walls of the wagon.  You can tell the owner of this wagon is
a toy maker.  Looking around you search for living quarters, but find
only a pile of blankets in one corner that appear to be used as a bed.
Looking more, you see a closet setting near the pile of blankets, but 
not much else is in the wagon except toys and tools to make toys.  A 
few items that a person would need for a horse are resting on the floor
in a corner.  The last item you see are a couple cabinets above that 
would hold food and such, but other than that, the wagon looks pretty
bare.

impressed by the menagerie of instruments hanging from the soft white
walls of the wagon.  The floor of the wagon is a smooth polished and
laquered pine floor.  Further off into the east of the long wagon,
you see a small crimson colored curtain which is partially open to
reveal a bedroom.  On the side of the wagon, there is a large wooden
workbench with a smooth &amp;Kdark wood&amp;n cabinet with a clear glass face
resting next to it.  As you peer into the glass you see the
unmistakeable forms of some very high quality instruments.  There are
two plush lavender recliners sitting at a table here.  There is also
a small &amp;Kblack&amp;n iron stove in the corner, with a long chimney reaching
up and out of the roof of the wagon.  On the stove itself is a
simmering pot of stew.

most of the structure around you. Its decorated with several hanging lamps
that are actually bolted, the colored glass of the lamps is decorated in
different colors giving a strange almost mysterious mood to the wagon. There
is a large workbench lining one wall, and several large chests lining the 
other wall, the chests are bolted down with steel bands and fixed so they
can be opened and closed. The room is decorated in many different kinds of
toolings and other paraphenalia, some strange and bizzare and others rather
normal looking. A thick set of curtains cover the back of this wagon, hiding
what ever is back there, the curtain its self is decorated with many leaves
and trees with a autumn scene and children playing.

there is order to the chaos and you guess that if Jonton needed anything from
this room, he could find it in seconds.  The shelves are lined with books and
parchments, some showing pictures of far away lands and strange looking
creatures.  It makes you wonder if he has seen these himself or if these
are just drawings of imaginary animals.  There is a window on the end wall
above the bed and this is also left open.  In the middle of the room there is a

craftsman.  A long bench occupies each side wall, the one on the left covered
with jewellery and trinkets.  The bench on the right is covered with
unfinished pieces and bits of unused metals.  There is also a tiny anvil there
and tools of all shapes and sizes hang on the right wall.  The stool that he
sits on while working is tidied away underneath the right bench.  Any space
that is not taken up with the tools of his trade is given up for paintings and
memorabilia of his travels.  The windows on each side are wide open so you can
catch any passing breeze.  One thing that looks out of place in this little
workshop is a box that contains letters written in a faded hand.

a &amp;Gm&amp;Bu&amp;Mr&amp;Ca&amp;Wl&amp;n covering all the &amp;Kw&amp;ca&amp;Rl&amp;ml&amp;Ys&amp;n, and the wooden &amp;ycabinets&amp;n in the wagon.
To the right is a high pedestal bed, with trunks stowed beneath it.
To the left a workbench, that would seem to be able to transform into
a dinner table, complete with a bench for seating.

On the table, and beneath it, are various pieces of &amp;ywood&amp;n,
which appear to be in different states of becoming toys.
towards the front left of the wagon is a large &amp;Kmetal&amp;n stove,
the remnants of former &amp;ycarvings&amp;n are sticking out of the 
&amp;Yk&amp;yi&amp;Yn&amp;yd&amp;Yl&amp;yi&amp;Yn&amp;yg&amp;n bucket in front of the &amp;Kstove&amp;n.

Next to the stove on the right is a &amp;wwash basin&amp;n. The &amp;yc&amp;Ga&amp;Rb&amp;Bi&amp;Cn&amp;Me&amp;Wt&amp;Ks&amp;n 
around the wagon appear deep, even more so because of the &amp;Gm&amp;Bu&amp;Mr&amp;Ca&amp;Wl&amp;n

Kelvanin&apos;s collection of stones, each polished to shine as the sun strikes

      <roomdescription>As you walk into the room, the first thing you feel is incredible heat.
You look around and find it is coming from a steel fireplace you would
find in a forge.  As you get over the fact that there&apos;s a fireplace in
a wagon, You start to notice an anvil, hooks on the wall with aprons
hanging from them, and a few hammers leaning against the wall.  Despite
the fact that it looks like a forge in here, the walls are painted a
variety of \c01c\c02o\c03l\c04o\c05r\c06s\c00, and a door on the east and west side of the room, and
a small box in the corner.

\c13blues\c00, and \c09greens\c00 on the walls. There is a large, goose-down bed in one
corner, and a couch in the other. There is a oak desk in the corner
covered in stacks of papers.  For what reason, you have no idea.

You look around, trying to locate the \c10source\c00 of the smell, and you finally locate it in a \c03chest\c00 that seems to be full of \c09herbs\c00.  Also, you see around you cooking \c23utensils\c00, \c14p\c00\c23o\c00\c14t\c00\c23s\c00, \c03p\c00\c07a\c00\c03n\c00\c07s\c00

You look around some more, and you notice an \c23old\c00 \c03chest\c00, which has a \c10big\c00 \c23lock\c00 on it, though you don&apos;t know why
a \c09Tinker\c00 would have a \c23lock\c00 on something, you shrug  and move on.

      <roomdescription>This is a small wagon as far as floor space is concerned, though
it is rather tall. A set of spiralling metal stairs leads upwards
to what is probably Ellane&apos;s bedroom and living area. This room
is not cramped even considering its size, its contents consisting
of just a few stools underneath the counters against the two walls
adjacent to the entrance, and a table a few feet in front of the
far wall. Behind that table is the small kitchen where Ellane does
most of her preparation with herbs, though some she does right on
the table which seems to serve as both a place for her to interact
with her customers and a cutting and grinding surface. On the table
is a large mortar and pestle, slightly stained from years of use.
On the walls, several different kinds of herbs hang from pegs at
various heights, creating an incredible fresh aroma about the room.

      <roomdescription>You climb up and ladder and find your self in a small loft above
the central room of the cabin.  A small bedframe draped with animal
skins sits in one corner, flanked by a small chest that probably held
the previous owners clothes and personal items.
 
A dusty brass lantern sits on top of the chest, having seen little use
in quite a while.  The floor is covered in a fine layer or dust, but
is otherwise clean and tidy.  Above you can see another lantern hanging
from a hook on the sloping wall of the cabin.
 
Everything has a peaceful feeling, as if the owner had just stepped out
and never returned.

head.  This leaves some  space below  the other floor...  but 
Bright uses that extra space as storage.  Towards the rear of
the wagon are the steps which lead back up  to the main room.
In to one  side of the room stands  the \c01forge\c07,  a large \c23stone\c07
affair carefully constructed to keep as much \c08heat\c07 as possible
away  from the wood of the wagon.  A small chute  opens above 
the  forge to draw the  \c22smoke\c07 and \c01hot air\c07 up and  out  of the
wagon. All around you are strewn the tool  of Bright&apos;s trade.
Hammers  of  all  sizes  line  the walls,  and the  workbench

the wagon, bolts of fabrics in assorted \c01c\c05o\c14l\c03o\c01r\c05s\c00 and textures are neatly
arranged.. and in another rests a sturdy \c03wooden\c00 chest on top of which 
lies a carved flute case and a neat stack of parchment.  On the opposite
side, a large scarf of fringed, \c04blue\c00 Domani silk separates the sleeping 
area from the rest of the wagon.  The wagon appears very tidy, free of 
knick-knacks and other clutter, seeming to be decorated to be inviting and
comfortable for the occupant and guests.

waterfall.  The deafeaning noise of the waterfall is somewhat drowned out
by the cabin&apos;s walls, enough to make the sound peaceful.  The room is not
too small, large enough for one or two people to live quite comfortably.
In the far right corner, there is a large bed meant for two people, and a
cot a pace away.  In the other corner is the woodstove, providing warmth
and means for cooking.  Hanging near the stove from pegs are an assortment
of pots and pans, all kept clean.  On the right wall, near the bed, there
is a simple wardrobe large enough to hold a man&apos;s clothes.  Some man&apos;s
boots lay under the plain &amp;ywooden&amp;n table that stands in the center of the
room, and a book rests on one of the two chairs around it.  A &amp;rred&amp;n blanket
rests on the back of a loves seat near the woodstove.

certainly hear it. The birds&apos; cries form a cacophony of sounds
that occasionally seems to come together in a crescendo that
almost manages to drown out the constant, incessant sound of the
dry wind through the branches above you. At this point you are
too deep in the forest to feel anything but a cool breeze. An
odd deviation from what you would expect given the force and heat
of the wind that is circulating just a hundred or so feet above
you, moving the tops of the trees and some of the branches below
from side to side in a uniform, choreographed swaying motion, as
though the whole forest is engaged in a dance.

be seen leading up and down the rocky trail. Someone has been
here fairly recently, and on foot - there are no horse prints

widening to allow for a tree in the middle, but mostly clear of

places. Aside from the occasional tree, the plant life here does
not provide enough coverage to keep one cool in the hot sun. Yet
overall, the area is quiet and fairly pleasant, if somewhat plain.

      <roomdescription>The deafening sound of rushing water penetrates your ears and mind,
blocking out all other senses except for the sight of a waterfall at least
a dozen paces wide and twice as tall.  The water crashes down the cliff
into a turbulent pool that is remarkably clear, for all the dirt that the
rushing water should be churning up.  The water in the pool looks to be
extremely deep at its midpoint, a deep \c04blue\c00 color that gradually becomes
lighter as the water shallows, until the edge of the pool holds crystal
clear water, as cold as melted snow.  Despite the natural beauty here, it
is rather dark, and a chilling mist drifts over everything, distorting the
shadows subtly and soaking everything in sight.  Leading northwards, is a
small dirt track, which leads right up to a rather ramshackle cabin.

      <roomdescription>\c00Behind the waterfall, you find yourself in a cavernous space that
stretches into the distance farther away from the waterfall, the
droplets of water from stalagtites hanging from the irregular
ceiling echoing through the vast space. The stalagtites in some
places are long enough to trail down and reach the massive
stalagmites that jut out from the rocky floor, smooth from the
passage of air and water over its surface. In a few corners, a
trickle of liquid along the slick walls collects in a pool. The
pools are of various hues of pale \c06blue\c00, \c07s\c00i\c07l\c00v\c07e\c00r, and \c05pink\c00, all
reflecting the distorted light coming into the cave from the
waterfall.

west which almost drowns off the faint trickle at your feet,
as a tiny stream of icy clear water makes its way through this
part of the cavern. Every footstep reverberates off the walls,
the echoes becoming louder as the ceiling trails down from its
height of ten paces or so to barely high enough to stand in.
Here and there a slithering, scaly animal moves about in the
darkness, moving away from the point of light faintly visible
to the east.

cold stone, out onto a small grassy clearing with a footpath
twisting and turning around bushes and boulders but heading
vaguely northeast. The cave itself appears to be embedded in
a rocky hill that slopes upward about a thousand feet before
stopping at a sheer granite cliff of about 200 spans. The area
that the path disappears into is extremely thick, indicating
that not many people are adventurous enough to explore this
place.

noises can be heard in the underbrush, and somewhere high above
a bird sends its call to others in the surrounding trees. Rocks
of all sizes litter the path, and once in a while a tree root
extends itself across the trail in a vain attempt to trip you.
A few light footprints are visible leading to the northwest.

The logs with which it was built now appear to be faded and
dried out, not to mention ridden with insects that seem to be
eating the framework of the cabin from the inside out. The porch
steps look as though they would have trouble supporting the
weight of a cat. For all its look of a long-abandoned cabin,
though, the windows are closed, shades drawn, and the door looks
to be bolted, though the bolt is rusty and decrepit.

rocking chair in the middle, covered with a fur blanket that is

for quite some time, as the pot hanging inside it is covered with
as much dust as everything else in the room. The only signs of
life come from a careful examination of the floor, which shows
two sets of footprints leading into the room to the east, and
only one coming out.

      <roomdescription>This must be the bedroom of the cabin, since there are only two
rooms, but the only thing here that looks at all like a bed is
a thin pile of furs covered by a blanket in the corner. As small
as the pile is, it takes up nearly half of the floorspace. The
room is extremely cramped; even the tiny washstand in the corner
opposite the furs seems to take up too much space. Glancing at
the furniture and the shoddy cleaning of the cabin as a whole,
it is easy to wonder how anyone could live in such filth.
