The Darkwood~
The Darkwood ends at the River Andahar to the west. You know that the
road lies somewhere to the east but you cannot tell how far through
the dense trees. The River looks like a nice place to get a drink and
perhaps rest up a bit.

The Darkwood surrounds you cutting out any light from the sky. You are

in the trees, or lumber across the ground in search of food. The road

The Slug and Cabbage Tavern and Supply Shop~
The main room of the store has several tables where some Domani traders
look to be doing a bit more drinking than trading. The oily light from
the lamps casts somewhat unhealthy glow on the entire place, but at least
the prices look good.

A trading post at the border of Arad Doman and Almoth Plain~
In the center of the small village small children run about at play with
big sisters running after them trying to keep them out of trouble. To
the north looks like a good place to stock up on supplies for the road,
while to the south a quant little Inn looks quiet inviting.

The Slug and Cabbage Inn~
The Main Room of the Slug and Cabbage Inn is extremely well kept and neat.
It appears that someone spends a huge amount of time making sure that
no stray dust particles find their way to any surface. To the southwest
you can hear a rather livly bar room that looks most inviting. There are
also stairs that go up to the rooms of the inn.

The Slug and Cabbage Bar~
The Bar is quiet lively with many rather drunk Domani traders having
what appears to be a very good time.  There is occationally a scuffle
that is quickly settled by the rather gruff looking bouncer. The Bar
itself looks well stocked with fine brews.
