Through a open pair of double doors the wooden table of the
dining room is already laid out with cutlery and plates and
through an arch to the east you can smell fresh air and here
the sounds of water flowing. Rich and colourful tapestries
line the walls here depicting a several people standing over
what looks like a flaming hole in the ground.

      <roomdescription>A large table sits in the middle of the room right before
a wooden bookcase obviously carved at great expense by a
master artist. Many books sit on the shelves though no dust
is evident. Several volumes do catch you eye and you notice
the words &quot;Prophecies of the Dragon&quot; written on the sides.
A large heavily padded leather backed chair sits behind the
table while two more rest in front. The sounds of rushing
water can be heard through an arch to the west.

several colourful and bulky hats.

cloaks and dirty shoes. The walls made from plainwood and
the floor of the same material, common in this quarter. From
the number of hooks along the wall it must see a great deal
of visitors. The smells of fresh bread wafts in from the main
room to the east along with the heat from a large fire.

part of it. Along one wall a large fire is burning, heating
a heavy black pot full of some sort of stew. Just beside
the fire a matronly woman is dicing up vegetables at a small
bench. In the centre of the room several chairs have been
placed. None of them expensive they still manage to convey a
sense of homely comfort.

house. The bed, barely large enough for two people, is tucked
into a corner. The cieling slopes down heavily and you wonder
if people in the bed have to duck when they are getting up.
A simple dresser sits beside the bed and a homemade cupboard
are the only aditions. A doorway is barely visable in the
corner of the room, hidden as it is in the shadows.

sides by a large barn and a small cottage with a thin
plume of smoke rising from it&apos;s chimney. The ground
worn bare from use and the oppressive heat, dust rises
with every step. The sounds of lifestock can be heard
a bit further to the east and through the large open
doors of the barn sveral horses have been stabled.

of the large horses used to pull the farming equipment. They
pause from munching at the fresh hay thrown down from the loft
above to fix you with a stare. A lone cow, tied to a post and
also sharing the hay makes her wish clear that it is past time
for her milking with a loud moo.

lays overgrown. What little plants that have shot up from
the ground seem wilted and dying. From an open door to the
north the smell of hay drifts from the barn.

place seem small in comparison. A young girl dressed in a servants uniform,
appearing to be half open at the moment, blushes while she pretends to be
hard a work polishing a golden goblet.

      <roomdescription>As dirty as the other rooms of this small inn the Kitchen is not
the best place in the city to buy food. A young woman stirs at a
pot beside a large fire most likey wating to be old enough to gain
a chance to serve at the tables outside. Another woman, heavier
and much older grimly kneeds at a ball of dough on a rough and
dirty chopping board, pausing from her work to mutter curses at
the girl.

amount of light to this cramped cell. The walls are rough and uneven and
the floor is broken by cracks a small holes in the dark stone. It is without
any form of adornment except for several rags in the far corner and a thin
plate of bent and twisted metal that has been tossed carelessly beside the
door.\c00

      <roomdescription>   A rather well furnished room has been etched out of the surrounding
black rock. The walls are unaturally smooth, though in a few places there
are jagged patches. An assortment of carpets and rugs from various lands
warm the floor. A large desk is positioned a little ways from the back 
wall, centered. It is made of glossy black wood, with expense writing
tools neatly kept on it. A large wooden chair, also black, is a perfect
match with the desk. They are both straight and angular and deep black in
colour, as if the wood were stained completly through. Several small carvings
adorn the front of the desk, representing the insignia of all the Trolloc
Tribes. A bone-white human skull rests on the right corner of the desk.
One chair is positioned in front of the desk, looking very old, and rather
shabby.

    <roombasic title="A High Dreadlord&apos;s room" vnum="6082" zone="60">
      <roomdescription>\c23A room has been carved out of the rock that makes up these caves, the
smoothness of the walls suggesting its origin as something other than physical
work.  A simple carpet, woven with repeating geometrical patterns, covers the
floor in front of the large desk in the centre of the room; the rest of the
flooring is the same black stone as the walls.  The desk itself, positioned
almost at the exact centre of the room and facing towards the door, is a plain
oak affair; neat stacks of leather folders take up one side, and a pen and
inkwell are neatly set beside them.  A few boxes, seeming to hold papers,
balance them on the other side, accompanied by a small tray containing sticks
of different sealing waxes - but strangely, no candle or lantern.  Between the
back and left walls, a deep ledge has been carved into the stone, about three
feet off the ground; a mattress placed on the ledge, with neatly folded
blankets atop it, makes it obvious of the alcove&apos;s purpose.  The rest of the
furniture consists of a simple cupboard, a large iron-strapped oak travelling
chest with a thick lock, and a washbasin.  Two wooden pegs which have somehow
been driven into the stone just inside the door support what seems to be the
only irregularity in this compact, almost impersonal room; a slightly curved,
sheathed cavalry sabre, the guard and steel scabbard showing numerous scratches
and dents.\c00
