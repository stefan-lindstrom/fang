      <roomdescription>This is a sturdy, wide stone bridge over the rushing waters of the River
Luan.  The level of water seems a bit low, and the banks on both sides
show hardened mud where the water should be.  Upstream, the Black Hills
can be seen in the hazy distance, perhaps several dozen miles away.  To
the far north, the faint outline of the black, jagged mountain called the
Dragonmount juts into the sky, its snow-capped peak a small white speck.
To the south, the road continues.

Black Hills and the surrounding landscape changes from the uniform
flatness of the plains into gently rolling hills dotted with leafless
trees and bare bushes.  Very few signs of civilization can be seen; nature
rules here, except for this road.  The surrounding scenery is mostly a
dead-looking yellow or brown colour, a reminder of the unnaturally long

      <roomdescription>The forest is not quite as dense here as it is to the north.  The outer
boundries of the capital of Andor, Caemlyn, begins a short distance to the
south, marked by a sign nailed to a post proclaiming proudly in grand red
letters, &quot;&amp;rCaemlyn, capital of Andor.  Greatest city in the Westlands.  &amp;n&quot;
The road, where to the north it was lightly travelled by only merchants
and assorted travellers, widens and seems to be used heavily.  
Southwards, even more people can be seen on the road, either travelling
towards or away from the city of Caemlyn.

      <roomdescription>The road here begins to see signs of heavy use as Caemlyn is within a
half-day's walk to the south.  Merchants in carriages, Queen's Guardsmen
on horseback, farmers in carts, and travellers on foot share the road, and
it becomes increasingly crowded the nearer one gets to the great city.  
The heat is extreme, and combined with the proximity of other travellers
and the dust raised by feet, hooves, and wheels, makes conditions rather
intolerable for a normal person.  To the north, the forest grows thicker
as the road leads towards the city of Tar Valon.  Southwards, Caemlyn sits
beyond eyesight.

decorated with a small, painted sign on its green-painted door.  The sign
depicts a generic-looking herb and obviously proclaims a wisdom's shop.  
The other buildings around seem to be of little interest to a weary

to offer something for everyone.  Queen's Guardsmen trot by on horseback,

      <roomdescription>The trail turns here abruptly, almost at a ninety degree angle, and leads
to the west and south.  The scenery, however, remains a bland and uniform
mixture of leafless trees and bushes, except for a large rock by the side
of the trail.  It seems to be made of basalt rock, as it is a large block
of black stone, its edges straight, yet not unnaturally so.  On it, there
is something scrawled with white chalk.  Down the trail, both ways,
nothing but more dead trees can be seen.

      <roomdescription>The trail turns here into a depression in between two large, rocky hills.
Oddly, it seems as though the two hills are actually one hill that has
somehow been split into two, as though a giant decided to rest his axe on
this spot, creating an almost perfectly wedged-shaped mini-valley.  The
walls are unnaturally smooth, with only a few bumps and grooves on the
surface.  Some small, shriveled shurbs and grasses grow here, since this
place is almost always covered in shadow.  It is shady, but still hot.  
The trail leads to the north and east from here.

shoulder-width and thin branches that whip and claw at skin and hair
crosses the path more often than not.  Dry, brown, dead brush litter the
trail and makes walking difficult.  It is quiet; not a single bird chirps
nor does the wind rustle through the bare, lifeless trees.  The trail

east, west and south.  To the west, the leafless forest looms as the trail

      <roomdescription>The forest gradually gives way to a dusty, empty street that cuts through
the middle of this abandoned town.  Most of the buildings in sight are in
poor shape, as though they have not been cared for for years.  Indeed,
this town has probably been forgotten by many, and left to the forest to
reclaim.  A building to the north seems to be in relatively good
condition, meaning that most of the wood that make up the building is not
rotting and its thatch roof could probably keep out most rain, if it ever
rains again.  A house to the south is in much worse condition, with most
of its roof gone and all visible wood rotting.  To the east, the main
square of the town can be seen, and the forest lies to the west.

emptiness of this place can be seen clearly; every building in sight is
dilapidated or worse.  Many of them are made of stone or brick, and all
are cracked and chipped.  Where wood is exposed, it has either been eaten
or rotted away, or is rotting or being eaten by termites and such.  The
road splits around a statue and well in the exact centre of the Square.  
The granite statue has long since been eroded to the point where
identification is impossible.  The large well is half-collapsed, with many
of the stones that make up its wall gone, and the mortar that holds the
stones has crumbled long ago.  Weeds have once grown unchecked everywhere,
but the dry summer has killed even the most hardy weed.  A disgusting
odour can be smelt to the north, and the sounds of a kitchen can be heard
to the south.  A large, somewhat well kept house lies uphill to the east
and the forest looms to the west.

The walls are as dirty as the floor, with many food stains, from fights,
possibly, covering the once whitewashed wood.  At the back of the room,
the wall has been ripped away, or it has rotten away, to expose a yard of
sorts that contains an open fire pit.  On the pit is a cauldron where most
of the food is likely to be prepared.  A long table rests in the middle of
the room, and is the only piece of furniture to grace this house.

people, a large dresser, a nightstand and a somewhat new rug are the only
furnishings in this room.  The furniture are all simple, handmade objects
that are made cheaply and made to last.  This room is not quite spotless,
with the corners dirty and some dirt staining the rug.  A hallway can be
seen to the north, and a cleaner bedroom further on.

can be seen on the southern wall, its stones cold this time of year
because of the unnatural heat.  Large windows provide a view of the
outside and lets in a hot breeze that seems to do little to improve the
stifflingly hot temperature.  Tables and their accompanying chairs fill
the room, arranged in a simple, neat grid, along with a ring of battered
wooden benches lining the walls that is broken by the various doorways
that lead to various places in the inn and the counter that serves as a
bar.  A stairway leads upwards, to the rooms on the second floor.

many open flames in the room, it is hot, almost unbearably so.  The smoke

with its smoky, sooty aroma.  A small hole in the ceiling serves as a
chimney.  People run about, cooking or carrying things or standing at a
wide rectangular counter, set in the middle of the room, preparing food.
A door in the eastern wall leads out to the common room.

hay seem to be everywhere; on the ground, in the air.  Piles of horse
manure can be seen, as though the people who were hired to clean the place

lazy-looking boys loiter about, obviously not doing their chores.

The mud that makes up the ground is somewhat dry, making it somewhat easy

handily.  Dirty stalls line the wall, and most of them are occupied by
fine-looking horses.  A handful of grooms rush about, doing chores.

comforting and welcoming.  People walk by on foot, either looking relieved

Guards line the side of the road, standing by the walls of the gate, their
alert eyes scanning the passerbys for trouble.  The town of Alindaer
stretches to the north, its streets teeming with a sort of dull, depressed

      <roomdescription>Leading from the main road, this straight, smaller road leads towards a
farmhouse.  The road's centre and both sides are covered with brown, dead
grass and weeds.  Cleared fields lie on either side of the road, the crops
long since harvested.  All that remains are rotting stalks and roots in
the brown, dry soil.  The house up ahead seems to be in good condition,
with no obvious things that are wrong with it.  A barn is to the south,
the sounds of some animals eminating from it.

      <roomdescription>This is a large, yet cozy room, used as a dining room and a parlour.  A
fireplace on the western side of the room is lit with a small fire,
casting a soft, warm light into the room.  A rocking chair stands in front
of the fireplace, and a well used rug lines the floor near it.  A hump in
the rug seems suspicious.  A long dinner table, made to seat at least
eight people, and some chairs at the table rounds out the furnishings in
the room.  A kitchen can be seen to the north and a bedroom to the south.
A staircase leads upwards.

      <roomdescription>This is a field, like any other field.  The dry soil has turned into sand,
and the remains of this year's harvest is rotting in the sandy soil,
causing a rather nasty smell.  The forest looms at the edges of the field,
separated by a low, crude stone wall.  A doorway leading into the
farmhouse is to the west, and a road lies to the south.

      <roomdescription>This is a barn.  Stalls line opposite sides of the walls, and only a few
of them are occupied.  The sharp smell of hay and pungent animal excrement
fill the air thickly.  A few horses, most of them large draft and work
horses, fill the stalls closest to the barn door.  Further on, a single,
solitary milk cow, and a few oinking pigs round out the list of animals
present.  The stock of hay seems to be running low, as with most other
supplies.

over the place, a fireplace, and a pantry.  The smell of cooking and
cooked food lingers in the air, along with some smoke from the fires.  
The pantry seems to be short on food, which is not very surprising, at
this time of the year.  A door on the eastern wall leads outside, and the
main room of the house is to the south.

bodies on the floor and on the beds.  The walls are bare, with no
whitewashing to cover the brown, roughly dressed wood.  The main room of
the farmhouse is to the north.

floor creaks with every step, and is very clean, with no dirt or dust on
the brown surface.  It is very hot up here, more so than downstairs,
possibly because this floor is closer to the thatch roofing that keeps out
rain and keeps in heat.  A bedroom lies to both the north and south and a
stairway leads down to the main room.

Most of the cellar is empty space, with only a few burlap sacks of
vegetables, and barrels of salted meat, beer and liquor piled in one
corner.  The floor of the cellar is bare, exposed earth.  In some parts,
it is hard, packed dirt, in others, it is the opposite.  The sounds of
tiny feet scuttering on the ground can be heard behind the pile of food.
Even rats need to eat...
