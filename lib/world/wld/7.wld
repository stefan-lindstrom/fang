      <roomdescription>Glass surrounds this room, twinkling, sparkling and dazzling the eye.  Many
sheets of glass hang, suspended from the ceiling by unseen wires, in all
different shades of blue, purple and gray.  The crystalline ceiling itself is
multi-faceted, creating a prismatic affect that sends shards of light in a
multitude of definite hues, that are further split and refracted by the plates
of glass, giving the room an almost ethereal feel to it that isn't lessened by
the scent of tea that trickles in from the east, or the eye-bending room to the
north.

      <roomdescription>Majestic pillars along the walls form arches across the room, creating a dome
ceiling of which sections are glass to let in the sunshine or a scattering of
stars at night.  The floor is a blue-gray and made of slabs of cool slate.  
Here and there sunk into the floor are oval baths filled with aqua, green or
blue water of varying shades.  These baths are kept heated from furnaces
located below the bath house.  Some of the baths are large enough to
comfortable accommodate two hundred people, while numerous others are designed
for smaller groups of twenty-five or so, and others only hold the intimate
number of two or three people.  Between the bath pools are wave shaped walls of
block glass.  The windows are large bubbled glass rimmed in gold bands like
port holes in a ship.  Low cushioned benches lie near the bath pools for
lounging and storage of clothing in the hidden compartments below the cushions.
Around the bath pools you will find candles, scented soaps, bath sponges, bath
brushes, chilled wine holders of silver, crystal goblets, bath oils, scented
lotions, bath spices, and spare bath robes.  There is one bath pool that has a
ring of fire that can be lit for special guests.  To the west lies the tranquil
bath garden and the whole west wall opens to reveal the garden as if it were
part of the bath house itself.

arrangements of blooming flowers.  Meandering near the garden path is a
babbling brook.  Tucked away in a secret corner is a summer gazebo painted
white with ornate spindles, spires and trimwork.  Inside the gazebo is a large
swing, delicately made of carved wood, the back a fanciful harp, that creaks
softly when swung.  The swing can be removed for the performance of idyllic
summer musicals.  Most of the garden trees are small and full of blossoms, but
there are a few large trees, the sort that are just made for climbing.  To the
east you can see the baths.

      <roomdescription>Emerging through the branches, one would be greeted with the sight of a small
and level platform.  Originally made for children who have regretfully grown old,
and moved on to other things.  The tree house now serves as a refuge, a safe
haven to be used when the everyday pressures and concerns of the world grow to
be too much and a break is needed.  Wooden planks make up the floor, simple in
construction yet aged and worn by wind and rain, into a simplistic form of
beauty that is only increased by the sunlight dancing through the leaves,
causing the furtive shadows to seek refuge of their own further back among the
branches.  Green leaves frame the tranquil scene, at the edge of sight no
matter where a person's attention might be focused.  Frequently, a songbird or
two visit for whatever reason a bird might have for such things, paying for their
intrusion with a song or two, for listening ears.  If one were to walk right to
the edge of the tree house, one would be able to peer down into the garden
below, a dizzying sight from up here, yet quite lovely regardless.

      <roomdescription>Like any storage area there are all sorts of things one might find if they look
around and explore.  Most things are packed away in wooden crates that have
been nailed shut.  Here and there are a few trunks, some with detailed tooling,
but most just plain and ordinary.  A few pieces of furniture covered with drop
cloths are stored here as well.  Everything has been neatly arranged by ever
attentive servants.  There are no windows and without a light source it is
quite dark.

      <roomdescription>Unlike the room above, this room is rarely used.  It is cold, dark and dank.  
Even with lighting, it stills seems like the shadows swallow up the light.  
Large rats that seem almost the size of cats bravely move about looking for
food.  Oddly enough, there are four cages stored here.  Apparently, they once
housed animals of some sort, but being quite heavy no one has bothered trying
to remove them from this room.  Also there is a few worn chairs, old sofa, a
beat up desk, and a musty cot about the room.  No one uses this room and the
servants don't store things here.  A feeling of gloom and despair seems to
permeate this room as though something evil dwells amid the darkness and the
constant, slow dripping sound of water.

chest of drawers made from alabaster with gold handles stands in one corner of
the room.  The fireplace has a scallop shell design.  The bedding is white
satin and is smooth as a pearl.  Upon the abalone inlaid dresser stands a
collection of small perfume bottles all carved from large odd shaped pearls.  
In another corner of the room is a shell shaped wash tub, with coal pan
underneath for keeping the water warm.

wildcats.  Even the dresser mirror has a reclined cat in amber gracing the
mirror's top-most curve.  There is a collection of carved boxes that house a
variety of tabac.  The collection of amber jewelry is nice, but being able to
use the collection while staying in this room is an added bonus.  The
chandelier of amber creates an ambience that is truly unique.

door of this office is rather interesting as it is a carved map of Cairhien,
before the Sun Palace was built.  Champagne colored sofas and contrasting
chairs are precisely placed in this office with accent tables to hold books and
goblets.  On the west wall is a nice wine cabinet which the servants keep fully
stocked.

railings across them to hold seals.  This is really a historic library of
personal seals that have been issued to nobles for the last few hundred years.
No seals of living nobles are kept here due to the potential for abuse, but
once deceased their seals are displayed here with a gold plate below each with
the name of the noble owner and dates the seal was in use.  Each seal is made
of brass, but the handles vary greatly.  Some handles are made from rare woods,
others are set with gemstones, some are intricately carved while still others
depict stunning art work.  The nobility often come here to get ideas for their
own personal design.

pearl encrusted, this chalice made an unusual journey through seven nations.  
The simple gold one with the waves is said to have existed before the end of
the Age of Legends.  The gold chalice with the encircling rising suns is
supposed to have belonged toone of the Kings of Cairhien.

There are pipes, quills, imitations of famous pieces of jewelry, musical
instruments, and even paintings and drawings fashioned by nobles.  The rich
tapestry hanging on the wall depicts the founding of Cairhien.  Paintings of a

is a celebration of the Sun and its many gifts to the land.

      <roomdescription>Great marble columns of a fluted design are set around this library.  Large
arched windows lie between the columns.  Shelves of mahogany wood hold these
fine leather bound books behind brass railings.  There are not many books in
this library and it is used primarily for reading.  In the center of the room
is a brightly polished brass book stand that holds an open book.  The royal
librarians from other countries sometimes exchange books or make copies of
books available for scribes to copy.  Large silk pillows of red and edged in
gold with gold tassels upon each corner lie below some of the windows.  A tea
service lies upon a table between two of the marble columns.

      <roomdescription>The high dome like ceiling help give this room its name.  Causal speech can be
heard at any place in the room as if it were whispers.  Even late at night,
some servants have claimed to hear whispers of those who lived long ago and
stayed in this manor.  In the center of the room is an alabaster statue of two
sisters, one whispering in the other's ear.  Upon the walls are tapestries,
evocative of the old Tairen ones often seen in the houses of Tear's nobility.
A marble fireplace crowns one of the walls, while a scattering of plush velvet
sofas and chairs offer a stately retreat for the manor's nobility.

inviting to sleep upon.  The ceiling is high with exposed rafters.  There is an
oval window, amber in color from dust and lack of cleaning.  The sun shines
through this window washing the whole hayloft in a mellow gold.

carriage is a royal blue with fine leather bench seats inside and Tairen rug on
the floor.  Green plumes grace an emerald carriage with shiny brass runners and
silk interior, it is obviously belongs to some noblewoman.  Servants rush about
with copper buckets of water and cakes of soap washing down any dirt or dust
from the carriages, while others change wheels and make other minor repairs.

from the large, tinted window, bathing the room in a warm rose color.  
Everything along walls from the dresser, the bedposts, the mirror frame
and even the door handles, all of which are intricately carved into a
dazzling array of suns.  There is a large trunk at the foot of the bed
holding spare blankets.  A wine cabinet lies near the fireplace and is
well stocked with the best Cairhien vintage to be found this far south.  
A small writing table takes full advantage of the sunlight through the
window and has a hutch that boasts a couple of books with delicate leather
binding.  The rug on the floor is also of a great rising sun.

tigers, wolves, and other animals seem as if they are carved from ice.  Trees
embraced by glass ice, spangle even the night with whorls of crystal branches.
A leaf here and there flashes silver or gold like some strange jewel that grows
only in the coldest night.  Snow hares of glass freeze in one's wake.  In the
center is a sculpture of horses white as hoarfrost in caught in a moment of
fluid motion.  Their eyes are crystal-fire and have wild manes that seem to
catch dark wind, snow and falling stars.  One can almost imagine the swirling,
misty ribbons of snow.

looking glasses just like some of the noble commanders use on the battlefield.
Only these are very large and made so one can see beyond the city walls.  On a
clear night, one can see all the stars in the sky.  And on magical summer
nights the orchestra might play up here and dazzle all of Caemlyn.

used to contain fabulous wealth.  Today, these caskets form a collection each
with its own story.  There is a silver casket with an intricate lock that once
held the wedding bands of some Andoran noble couple.  Another casket shaped
like a ship once held a map of the trade winds, long lost.  Still another
casket of alabaster once contained the love letters of a certain noble lady
that caused quite a scandal at Court.  In the center of the hall is a dark blue
marble pedestal upon which is large casket carved from animal horn, its lid
translucent while the base is covered in velvet and contains a crystal decanter
of wine and several fluted glasses.

      <roomdescription>Several blacksmiths and their apprentices work here over rectangular
forges made of stone and soot ridden.  It is a hot and dark place except
for the light from the fires burning in the forges.  Against the wall,
stacked shoulder high are logs for the forge.  There are bellows for
fanning the fires and leather aprons hanging from hooks along the wall.  
Several barrels of water can be found for cooling the metal so it can be
handled as well as tempered.  Of course, the water can also be used to put
out fires if the need arises.  There are wooden tubs of brine, oil or
tallow that allow for a slower cool and provide a more delicate tempering
of the metal.  Hammers and double-horned anvils dot the room and are used
for shaping the metal.  Other tools that can be found in this room are:
swags, tongs, small shovels, pokers, cutters, bottom fullers, mandrels,
chisels, punches, flatters, drifts, nail and bolt headers, milling
cutters, taps, jamb plates, screw plates, pump drills, reamers, shears and
vices.  All these tools are handmade by each apprentice before he can rise
to a master blacksmith.

with roses to the hilt. Against one of the other walls is a bookshelf, bearing 
books on tactics, law, geography, and some others that appear to be log-books 
regarding the Guard itself. Across from the bookshelf is a side table, flanked 
on either side by chairs up against the wall, above the table is a banner 
bearing the White Lion of Andor. Next to the desk is a sturdy, but small,
weapons rack.

      <roomdescription>Through a graceful archway leads a path formed of mottled blue marble
flagstones, branching in several places to lead in and around the
rosebushes for which this garden gains its name.  The bushes come in a
multitude of shapes and sizes, and their colours come in every shade of
&amp;Rred&amp;n imaginable, &amp;rdarkest burgundy&amp;n's through to &amp;Wp&amp;wr&amp;Wi&amp;ws&amp;Wt&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;we &amp;Ww&amp;wh&amp;Wi&amp;wt&amp;We&amp;ws&amp;n.  The most

&amp;wi&amp;Kr&amp;wo&amp;Kn&amp;n frame entwined with blossoming &amp;gvines&amp;n and its intricate &amp;Kmetal&amp;n
decorations polished to a dull &amp;Wg&amp;Kl&amp;We&amp;Ka&amp;Wm&amp;n.  Another branch of the path leads
over a similarly formed bridge, the view over the twisted railing showing
a shallow pool stocked with small &amp;mpurple&amp;n and &amp;ggreen&amp;n fish.  Fanciful &amp;Kw&amp;wr&amp;Ko&amp;wu&amp;Kg&amp;wh&amp;Kt
&amp;wi&amp;Kr&amp;wo&amp;Kn&amp;n benches can be found evenly situated around the garden, and a few

      <roomdescription>This a more solitary section of the room is surprisingly as neat and
organized as any other room, even if less decorative.  Its paneled walls
are bare of pictures or even hangings and tapestries, though a few oddly
colored patches show signs that some items have hung there in the past.  
Lights have been placed in smoky glass orbs to spread their effectiveness
in a most common sense manner, the devices held on light chains from the
ceiling.  A single bay window pushes outwards from its wall, silvery silk
curtains draping across a black tassled pillow that pads the alcove formed
there.  It looks a perfect place to read, though by the appearance of a
very full, though well organized desk, the occupant of this room probably
never uses it.  The floor bares its wooden self to walking feet, no rugs
laid, a sign of some of the Cairhiens taste for necessities over
extravagances.

eye for style.  It seems a tidy place clothes neatly stacked on top of a
cupboard in a corner, bed made, a few books piled together.  The single
bed standing at the left wall is covered in a blue woven blanket, matching
the small rugs placed at intervals around the floor.  A wall hanging with
simple, repeating patterns of interlocking green spirals covers part of
one wall, above a small table scattered with a few possessions.  A cloth
sack hangs from a peg, strong herbal smells coming from it a pestle and
mortar rests on the table.  This room seems impressed with the presence of
a resident herbalist, from the colourful cloth on the walls to the
carefully positioned chairs by the table.

House Jagad.  There is a sofa upholstered in black leather flanked by two
winged-back chairs before the fireplace.  A desk with a hutch graces one
of the walls and next to it is a plain wine cabinet of ebony with silver
foxes for pulls on the doors.  The armoire is a magnificient work of art
besides being functional.  The doors of the armoire are carved in fine
detailed depicting hunting scenes on horseback with lovely landscapes of
the Borderlands all in ebony.  But the most impressive piece of furniture
is the ebony bed.  The headboard looks more like the figurehead from some
ship, depicting a fox, carved with incredible detail making it look as if
it were truly alive and about to leap across the top of the bed.  The fox
is streaked with silver and its eyes are piercing and seem to move as if
watching the room inhabitants.  Even the teeth are the teeth of a real
fox.  There are many silver objects in this room all depicting foxes.  By
the window is a game table also made of ebony with legs carved like
sitting foxes.  On the table sits a game of stones and in the drawer is a
hand painted deck of gilded cards.

      <roomdescription>This room is like a blinding sun from the moment anyone with sight enters
within it.  The carpet is a blindingly harsh shade of yellow that almost
reflects the light scattered upon it by the finely polished brass
contained lamps.  The covers upon the pine bed are made of what appears to
be the brightest shade of yellow conceivable.  The walls themselves are
painted in the color.  Even the pine wardrobe that faces the bed is
covered in bright yellow fabric that drapes down the sides and covers the
top.  Only the finely polished doors are free of the pigment.  There is
nothing in the room other than bed, the wardrobe, and the lamps that
surround the chamber.  Even some of them are not casting light, though the
number of them assures that there is more than enough light cast about the
room.  The entire chamber seems rather bare despite its fine furnishings.

    <roombasic title="House Anshar Sitting Room" vnum="814" zone="7">
      <roomdescription>The room is very sparsely decorated, but everything in the room is of the
up-most quality.  Lush beige carpeting covers every square foot of the
room.  Three very plush cream couches make three sides of a square.  
Dozens of matching pillows are tossed seemingly casually onto those
couches, but something about the way they are placed makes it seem as if
they were planned to be casual.  In the center area bordered by the three
couches, there is a very heavy, ornamental coffee table.  It is stained
very dark; almost a burnt umber.  The color of the table offsets the rest
of the dcor in a way that makes it seem like the centerpiece of the room.
On the wall, across from the door to the hallway, a very large tapestry
hangs on the wall.  It is a very dark maroon; almost the color of dried
blood.  On it rests the sigil of House Anshar; the rose of Andor in a
gloved hand.  From the way the hand holds the rose, it isn't clear if the
rose is being crushed or held tenderly.  Two large bay windows occupy the
wall on either side of the tapestry, bathing the room in the warmth of
sunlight during the day and offering a good view of the Palace grounds at
anytime.  A small bar area is set up directly under the tapestry, offering
guests and residents alike a choice of beverages.

rest on the bed as well.  On either side of the bed are two small end
tables, made from the same wood and stained the same color as the coffee
table in the sitting room.  A wardrobe, also of similar color and design,
rests against one of the other walls.  Several portraits grace the walls,
all of them done in oil.  By the way they are prominently displayed, it is
likely that they are all of House Anshar nobles.

      <roomdescription>A large desk sits in the center of this sparse room, some papers sit in ordered
stacks upon its polished surface.  A large chair sits behind the desk, another,
smaller chair in front of it, four more chairs of the smaller size line the
walls so they can be pulled at any time for use.  A small table sits near the
arm of the chair, a book, page marked with a red ribbon sits on it.  The room
seems well appointed, yet practical.

      <roomdescription>The most impressive thing about this study is the large oval window, made
stained glass depicting the Andoran lions amid roses in the countryside.
In front of the window lies a mahogany desk richly inlaided with a border
of lions and at the center lies the Taravin sigil.  The hutch holds an
assortment of offical looking documents.  The sofa and chairs in this room
are all leather.  With the exception of the east wall with its window, all
the walls are lined with bookshelves.  While there may be few books, there
are documents and more portraits that fill in the empty places.  The early
morning hours find this study flooded with the rich jeweled light of a new
day through its stained glass window.  A complete tea service lies before
the sofa with a nearby platter of scones or some delicate pastry.  There
is a hidden locked safe where its likely most of the valuable Taravin
House documents are stored.  This room is seldom without one of the
Taravin Guard on duty.

bright because the servants keep it polished and free of tarnish.  The head
of the bed has a rising sun with all the rays and the foot of the bed is
smooth while the posts are fluted.  The floor mirror is beveled and set in a
silver frame.  Two chairs in the room are also silver and covered with a
pastel blue and white pattern almost like what one would expect to find on
china.  The sofa coordinates nicely with the chairs and the tables are all
silver with beveled glassed tops.  The fireplace and crown molding is
wrought in silver lilies.  This room has a quaint balcony that the west
wall opens onto and which is quiet pleasant for breakfast and sunset
dinners.

      <roomdescription>The steady sound of water dripping can be heard.  This room houses an
assortment of torture devices such as the iron maiden with its blooded
spikes.  It's a stinking dungeon, dark and vermin infested.  Here a person
might be left alone with their excrement.  Moldy bread and stale water
helped to supplement the cockroaches and spiders.  The dirt floor is bare
and into the stone walls are iron rings to which a prisoner can be bound.
Time in a place like this can lose all meaning.  The oral pear is another
torture device that are forced into the mouth of the victim and there
expanded by force of the screw to the maximum aperture of their segments.
The pointed prongs at the end of the segments serve better to rip into the
throat.  There is also the classical rack that results in the dislocation
of every joint in the body, loud popping sounds mixing with shrieks of
agony, futile cries for pity.  A fire-pit stands ready to heat the
pinchers, brands and pokers.  Intestines can be slowly wound onto pulleys
before the dying victim's eyes.  These are just some of the devices and
pleasures that await the torturer.

arched columns of polished blue marble with gold inlaid bands at the top and

Polished brass oil lamps upon ornate floor stands, give light to this room.  
In the center lie carved platforms of red marble rimmed with double bands of
gold, upon which the newly dead are placed before permanent burial in the
crypts.  Kneeling benches padded with soft blue velvet are to the north of the
platforms.  At the far north is a niche in the wall that houses the burial
chalice kept filled with a deep red wine.  Beyond the arches lies a hallway
along which are the ornately carved crypts.

wall with an interesting collection of stone jugs.  Several tables and
chairs are tastefully arranged throughout the room as well as a number of
candlestands with thick pillars of beeswax.  There are fluted columns and
palmettes with ovolo mouldings on the panelling which provide an elegant
and decorative screen to the anteroom behind it.  The anteroom lends
privacy for sleeping, bathing and dressing.  Also, within the anteroom can
be found a lady's dressing table and armoire with carved medallions of
jade.  There is even a cushioned basket for the pet dog to sleep upon.

six-tiered crystal chandelier.  There is also moulded plaster ornament
with corner rosettes used as a ceiling border.  The floor has a border
stencilled with a scroll-work design.  The bed is richly dressed and there
is an armoire for storing clothing.  Besides the small dining table which
doubles for a gaming table as well as writing table, there is a well
stocked wine cabinet.  Perhaps the oddest thing about this room is the
rumours that it is haunted by several ghosts, including one ghost who was
a Hunter of the Horn.  Regardless, there can be no disputing the fact that
the room does have its cold spots and odd sounds.

carved from the walls.  Fashioned from every substance imaginable, crafted
as exquisitely or plainly as the makers pleased, the roses are depicted
both as buds and in bloom, in various shades throughout the spectrum.  
This hall itself follows the standard presented throughout the Royal
Palace, being broad enough to drive a wagon down, with ceilings higher
than could ever be needed.  The floor and walls are formed of &amp;Ws&amp;Km&amp;Wo&amp;Kk&amp;Wy &amp;ww&amp;Wh&amp;wi&amp;Wt&amp;we&amp;n
marble, the first kept well scrubbed and gleaming, the second adored with
occasional tapestries or holding tall, broad windows.  Doorways along the
hall lead to the palace guest chambers.

      <roomdescription>This is a grand hall, the length of which is banded by arch after arch.  
Each arch is in an elaborate baroque style carved of scrolling acanthus
leaves, bulging fruit and other symbols of natural abundance.  From the
center of each arch are fancy turned spindles of polished mahogany.  
Hexagonal lanterns burning oil are equally spaced among the arches.  The
ceiling has painted figurative roundels placed within the plasterwork.  
It is painted in delicate tones of gray-blue.  Niches in the walls between
the arches have seats uphosltered in rich velvets.

      <roomdescription>The most impressive aspect of this room is that it is circular and along
one part of the circle is a built-in bookcase.  It has pilasters which
frame the inset panel above and connect the bookcase to the cornice.  
Tracery designs on the glass doors of the bookcase not only protect the
precious books within but also make a statement about how books are
valued.  A fireplace stands opposite of the bookcase.  There is a sofa,
chairs and a magnificent desk as well as plenty of oil lamps to facilitate
reading.  There is an arched doorway flanked by fluted columns of marble
that lead to the bedchamber with its bed, armoire, chairs and hip tub
before yet another fireplace.

      <roomdescription>This moderately sized chamber is decorated entirely in ivory and silk of a
pearlescent white shade.  The bed has four posts of carved ivory from
beyond the Aiel Waste, each one of a size that reflects incredible rarity.
The curtains that shroud it are of white silk, the same as the covers and
sheets that cover the mattress.  Adorning the headboard is a carving of a
tiger, also in ivory and in perfect detail, glinting faintly in the
subdued light of the various lamps that hang from the walls of the
chamber.  Each one is wrought in iron and also painted to reflect the same
color as the rest of the room.  Complementing the bed is a dressing table
constructed of white marble that rests beside it, a work of art that
reflects the craftman's mastery.  Across the room beneath a window is a
similarly constructed desk, the surface of which is clear of any objects.
The floor is covered in a wooly white carpet that allows your feet to
practically sink within its depths, covering the stone that surely lies
beneath.

    <roombasic title="The Queen of Andor's Banquet Hall " vnum="862" zone="7">
      <roomdescription>\c00This is a magnificently long hall dominated by a mahogany banquet table.
The table is a marvel with its pedelstals carved as three rampart lions
back to back, each depicited in a roar with paws out.  The detail of
carving is a study in perfection.  The apron of the table is a carved
border of rosettes.  Upon the highly polished table are golden candelabras
set with tapered white candles containing flecks of gold.  From the
ceiling hang ornately carved filigrees upon hinges which serve as fans
moved back and forth by the servants.  Fireplaces line both walls and are
interspersed with built-in cupboards and serving tables topped with
marble.  Only the offical state porcelain with the Andoran Lion seal and
rose border is used here.  Even the balloon back chairs with their thick
cushions, have carved legs of Andoran Lions.  Of course, everywhere can be
found freshly cut roses of all colours not only decorating this hall but
lending a distinct rose scent to the aire.

      <roomdescription>This chamber is furnished with carefully carved wooden furniture.  The bed
is made of oak, carefully carved in a motif of suns and thorns.  They
surround the entirety of the bed, invisible only where covered by the
finely woven blue silk that provides the covering for the mattress.  The
carpet that hides the marble floor is a beautiful blue color that is not
dark.  It is quite thick, though not as thick as the carpets in some of
the other rooms.  It provides a comfortable cushioning for the feet atop
the otherwise harsh stone.  There is a wardrobe with a turquoise coverlet
atop it sitting in the corner of the room to the far left of the bed.  To
the right of the door that provides entrance to the room is a dressing
table that appears to be crafted rather simply for the rest of the room,
though surely of the finest oak just as everything else.  Above it a
mirror shines set in artistically wrought iron in a spiral pattern.  The
faint glinting and flickering of the light around the edges of the mirror
reveals some otherwise hidden device for the artful refraction of light.
The lamps that provide light for the room are also wrought iron.

specially trained to pulled the silk cords of these silver bells.  Each bell
has been carefully etched with Andoran symbols and episodes from her history.
The bells are rung first in the morning, then the midmorning bells, the high
bells, the prime bells, the second bells and finally the trine bells are rung.
Wooden louvers protect the bells from the weather and lets the sound fill the
Caemlyn streets.  Not only do the bell ringers ring the bells they are also
responsible for their maintenance.  A spiral staircase leads up to the belfry.
The sheer size of the bells are a marvel to behold.

      <roomdescription>This spacious bedroom wouldn't be called grand by most, but it does not
lack in elegance.  The paneled floor is made of deep reddish- brown cherry
wood, this blemish-free wood visible on the edges of the room where it is
not covered by the elegant Taraboner rug.  A window set in the wall
adjacent to the door on the left opens this bedroom to the world, with
soft silk curtains being more of a cursory accessory than actually being
able to block the sunlight.  Opposite the window, a bed is set against the
wall, obviously softer and more plush than a simple commoner's bed.  The
four-poster is covered by an elegant canopy of silk, a woman's touch for
sure.  In the middle of the room is an intricately carved oak that blends
nicely with the floor, walls, and ceiling.  Four oak-backed chairs with
soft red velvet seats surround the table, making sure that the room's
occupants are comfortable.  On the wall opposite the door is a large
armoire of oak, as tall as the ceiling with dull bronze knobs there to
open the main cabinet, with two drawers near the floor beneath.

trade placed about it in a carefully ordered manner.  There is a rather
simple, though well made and nearly flawless table of oak that sits in the

plane, and a hammer, in that order.  They do not appear well used, though
there are a few small scratches on the surface of the table.  In the
corner there is something vaguely like a wardrobe, though only half as
tall and with several wooden drawers instead of two large doors.  It is
made in the same style as the rest of the room.  The walls are a simple,
finely polished wood as is the rest of the floor.  Though this place is
not lavish as most of the manor, it is obviously sufficient for the work
of a master crafter.

the gardens below.  A large fireplace trimmed in polished brass lies along one
of the walls.  Around the bath are candles, scented soaps, bath sponges, bath
oils, scented lotions, bath spices, chilled wine and crystal goblets.

by a thin window overlooking the stables.  A full standing Armoire,carved with
strange designs stands by the window.  Across from the Armoire is a rather
large desk with many small drawers and spaces, most of them locked. Several
chairs uphostered in \c23water-\c01silk\c00 and edged in burnished \c10gold\c00, appear to be 
rather worn. On the wall is a large \c03parchment Map\c00 of the known World,

stuck with \c01pins\c00. Upon the \c03floor\c00 is a thick rug with \c01red\c00 and \c23black designs\c00.
A \c10gold\c00 fluted stand for holding canes knocked over, it's contents
splayed on the floor. Obviously a maid has not been in here for some time.

with silver, except for the bed.  Every wooden surface of the bed has gold
and silver worked into it with abandon, and the sheets that cover the bed
themselves are of a metallic gold coloring, surely achieved with the use
of the actual metal in their weaving.  The wardrobe at the west edge of
the chamber is also of an oaken style with careful spirals and leaves
carved into the edges.  Each one is chased in lines of silver inlaid into
the wood and spiraling in every direction imaginable.  The lamps are
wrought in what appears to be silver, the refraction from the severely
polished metal casting the rays across the room.  There is a dressing
table directly to the left side of the bed formed in a similar fashion as
the rest of the furniture in the room.  Above it is a mirror set in silver
that is of a rather moderate size for such an otherwise richly endowed
space.  The floor is finely polished black marble.

bed frame is wrought of &amp;Wc&amp;Co&amp;Wl&amp;Cd&amp;k i&amp;wr&amp;ko&amp;wn&amp;n while situated within the frame are
several matteresses, achieving a rather comfortable look.  Atop of the
mattresses, are &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wk&amp;We&amp;wn &amp;Wsh&amp;wee&amp;Wts&amp;n, while above those are &amp;yr&amp;Yi&amp;yc&amp;Yh&amp;n blankets, and
several thick, feather pillows.  Immediately to the left of the dominating
bed is a &amp;yw&amp;goo&amp;yd&amp;ge&amp;yn&amp;n stand, with several levels of shelves, while atop each of
the shelves are various bits and pieces of scattered miscellany.  Against
the eastern wall, rests a large desk which rests in about the rough
center, with a large, &amp;kb&amp;ml&amp;ka&amp;mc&amp;kk l&amp;me&amp;ka&amp;mt&amp;kh&amp;me&amp;kr&amp;n chair resting nearby.  Another chair,
sits in the northeastern corner of the room, but this chair is of simple
wood with padded armrests.  Against the western wall of the room, rests a
large, oaken dresser, with several drawers and atop it, rests a large
&amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;Wy &amp;Cm&amp;Wi&amp;Cr&amp;Wr&amp;Co&amp;Wr&amp;n.  Each of the four walls in the room are painted in a &amp;Rf&amp;Yi&amp;We&amp;Yr&amp;Ry&amp;r
r&amp;Re&amp;rd&amp;n color, while the rich, plush carpet matches the coloring of the walls.
Standing in both the southwestern corner and southeastern corner of the
room are to large, &amp;yg&amp;Yo&amp;yl&amp;Yd&amp;ye&amp;Yn&amp;n candelabra, with many &amp;Rf&amp;Yl&amp;Wi&amp;Yc&amp;Wk&amp;Re&amp;Yr&amp;Wi&amp;Yn&amp;Rg&amp;n candles.  Set
in the middle of the southern wall, is a large, oaken door, with a shiny

    <roombasic title="An Odd Guest Chamber" vnum="897" zone="7">
      <roomdescription>This guest chamber is adorned in a style that might be considered rather
odd.  The material that forms the base for the bed and the lone dressing
table just to the left of the door that provides entrance to the room is
fine, if not carved oak.  But that is hardly the highlight of the space.
Covering the bed is a quilted blanket that obscures any of the sheets that
may lay beneath or the mattress, and upon nearly its entire surface is an
embroidered image that reflects several deers drinking from a pond.  
About them is a calm wilderness in the midst of fall, the many- colored
leaves of the trees all shown in excellent detail.  On the horizon
purplish and blue mountains with snow frosting their tops is shown.  The
dressing table itself is also covered in a similarly arranged blanket,
however it is not any coherent design.  Rather, it is covered in a myriad
confusing array of colors and shapes in a pattern of hexagons, octagons
and other many-sided figures.  Woven in and out of the figures is a huge
array of colors all embroidered in a process that must have taken an
extremely long time.  The lamps that shed light on this chamber are of a
simple wrought-iron form, and are perhaps wisely uncovered with any sort
of fabric.

covering the bed seem to have threads of gold woven within them that
sparkle in the glittering lamplight shed by lamps reflecting golden
sparkles themselves within their mirrored surroundings.  The bed itself is
wrought in polished brass.  The large table beyond the bed at the edge of
the room farthest from the bed is crafted in beautiful wood chased with
gold everywhere it could possibly be done, perhaps more than might even be
considered tasteful.  The same is done with each of the four chairs that
surround the table, and with the dressing table that is against the wall
nearest and right of the door.  Every time the light shifts for any
reason, the entire room seems to shift along with it as the sparkling
polished gold refracts the rays in coruscating patterns.  Above the
dressing table fastened to the wall is a mirror of rare size, set in what
appears to be gold, unlike the brass of the table, which would place its
worth far beyond that of any other object in the room.

      <roomdescription>   The grand ballroom of Lord Aldiaya certainly deserves the title
&quot;grand&quot;.  The high vaulted ceiling, painted white, is adorned with large
wooden beams that run from the peak of the room down walls and to the
floor, each one placed 10 feet from the nearest one.  A set of oaken doors
lies on the southern end of the room, providing entrance to the guests.  
A long red carpet runs the length of the room, nearly one hundred paces,
up to a raised stage with a podium and room behind for a band.  Instead of
a large feast table, as is common in such places, there are myriad round
tables that dot the room, each one with space for five or six people at
most.  Just below the podium on the northern end of the room is The High
Table, a place for honored guests.  The chair in the center of the High
Table is raised, obviously meant for the host or hostess, with six chairs
on either side.  Two balconies grace the eastern and western walls,
containing three tables and accesible by doorways underneath them on the
ground floor.  The southeastern corner has been cleared of tables and the
wood polished, making a makeshift dancefloor of sorts so that the guests
may entertain themselves after the food and drink is gone.
