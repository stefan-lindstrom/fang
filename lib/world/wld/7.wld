      <roomdescription>Glass surrounds this room, twinkling, sparkling and dazzling the eye.  Many
sheets of glass hang, suspended from the ceiling by unseen wires, in all
different shades of blue, purple and gray.  The crystalline ceiling itself is
multi-faceted, creating a prismatic affect that sends shards of light in a
multitude of definite hues, that are further split and refracted by the plates
of glass, giving the room an almost ethereal feel to it that isn&apos;t lessened by
the scent of tea that trickles in from the east, or the eye-bending room to the
north.

the room are gilded arches beyond which those who are not dancing may gather to

heady scent of brandy, to the west is the banquet hall and to the south lies
the orchestra.

brandy from around the land.  Dazzling crystal cut glasses line the beveled
glass shelving upon the wall.  This a relaxing room filled with dark reds,

smoke.

      <roomdescription>Majestic pillars along the walls form arches across the room, creating a dome
ceiling of which sections are glass to let in the sunshine or a scattering of
stars at night.  The floor is a blue-gray and made of slabs of cool slate.  
Here and there sunk into the floor are oval baths filled with aqua, green or
blue water of varying shades.  These baths are kept heated from furnaces
located below the bath house.  Some of the baths are large enough to
comfortable accommodate two hundred people, while numerous others are designed
for smaller groups of twenty-five or so, and others only hold the intimate
number of two or three people.  Between the bath pools are wave shaped walls of
block glass.  The windows are large bubbled glass rimmed in gold bands like
port holes in a ship.  Low cushioned benches lie near the bath pools for
lounging and storage of clothing in the hidden compartments below the cushions.
Around the bath pools you will find candles, scented soaps, bath sponges, bath
brushes, chilled wine holders of silver, crystal goblets, bath oils, scented
lotions, bath spices, and spare bath robes.  There is one bath pool that has a
ring of fire that can be lit for special guests.  To the west lies the tranquil
bath garden and the whole west wall opens to reveal the garden as if it were
part of the bath house itself.

      <roomdescription>A winding path of soft purple cobblestones are banked on either side by
arrangements of blooming flowers.  Meandering near the garden path is a
babbling brook.  Tucked away in a secret corner is a summer gazebo painted
white with ornate spindles, spires and trimwork.  Inside the gazebo is a large
swing, delicately made of carved wood, the back a fanciful harp, that creaks
softly when swung.  The swing can be removed for the performance of idyllic
summer musicals.  Most of the garden trees are small and full of blossoms, but
there are a few large trees, the sort that are just made for climbing.  To the
east you can see the baths.

    <roombasic title="The Tree House" vnum="744" zone="7">
      <roomdescription>Emerging through the branches, you are greeted with the sight of a small and
level platform.  Originally made for children who have regretfully grown old,
and moved on to other things.  The tree house now serves as a refuge, a safe
haven to be used when the everyday pressures and concerns of the world grow to
be too much and a break is needed.  Wooden planks make up the floor, simple in
construction yet aged and worn by wind and rain, into a simplistic form of
beauty that is only increased by the sunlight dancing through the leaves,
causing the furtive shadows to seek refuge of their own further back among the
branches.  Green leaves frame the tranquil scene, at the corners of your vision
no matter where your attention is focused.  Frequently, a songbird or two
visits for whatever reason a bird might have for such things, paying for their
intrusion with a song or two, for listening ears.  If you were to walk right to
the edge of the tree house, you would be able to peer down into the garden
below, a dizzying sight from up here, yet quite lovely regardless.

been nailed shut.  Here and there are a few trunks, some with detailed tooling,
but most just plain and ordinary.  A few pieces of furniture covered with drop
cloths are stored here as well.  Everything has been neatly arranged by ever
attentive servants.  There are no windows and without a light source it is
quite dark.

      <roomdescription>Unlike the room above, this room is rarely used.  It is cold, dark and dank.  
Even with lighting, it stills seems like the shadows swallow up the light.  
Large rats that seem almost the size of cats bravely move about looking for
food.  Oddly enough, there are four cages stored here.  Apparently, they once
housed animals of some sort, but being quite heavy no one has bothered trying
to remove them from this room.  Also there is a few worn chairs, old sofa, a
beat up desk, and a musty cot about the room.  No one uses this room and the
servants don&apos;t store things here.  A feeling of gloom and despair seems to
permeate this room as though something evil dwells amid the darkness and the
constant, slow dripping sound of water.

chest of drawers made from alabaster with gold handles stands in one corner of
the room.  The fireplace has a scallop shell design.  The bedding is white
satin and is smooth as a pearl.  Upon the abalone inlaid dresser stands a
collection of small perfume bottles all carved from large odd shaped pearls.  
In another corner of the room is a shell shaped wash tub, with coal pan
underneath for keeping the water warm.

wildcats.  Even the dresser mirror has a reclined cat in amber gracing the
mirror&apos;s top-most curve.  There is a collection of carved boxes that house a
variety of tabac.  The collection of amber jewelry is nice, but being able to
use the collection while staying in this room is an added bonus.  The
chandelier of amber creates an ambience that is truly unique.

door of this office is rather interesting as it is a carved map of Cairhien,
before the Sun Palace was built.  Champagne colored sofas and contrasting
chairs are precisely placed in this office with accent tables to hold books and
goblets.  On the west wall is a nice wine cabinet which the servants keep fully
stocked.

railings across them to hold seals.  This is really a historic library of
personal seals that have been issued to nobles for the last few hundred years.
No seals of living nobles are kept here due to the potential for abuse, but
once deceased their seals are displayed here with a gold plate below each with
the name of the noble owner and dates the seal was in use.  Each seal is made
of brass, but the handles vary greatly.  Some handles are made from rare woods,
others are set with gemstones, some are intricately carved while still others
depict stunning art work.  The nobility often come here to get ideas for their
own personal design.

pearl encrusted, this chalice made an unusual journey through seven nations.  
The simple gold one with the waves is said to have existed before the end of
the Age of Legends.  The gold chalice with the encircling rising suns is

his wives mysteriously died by stabbing and the assailant never captured.  
There are pipes, quills, imitations of famous pieces of jewelry, musical
instruments, and even paintings and drawings fashioned by nobles.  The rich
tapestry hanging on the wall depicts the founding of Cairhien.  Paintings of a
number of noble weddings can be found in various gold bound books as well as

rising.  Andorans claim this room has nothing to do with Cairhien, but rather
is a celebration of the Sun and its many gifts to the land.

      <roomdescription>Great marble columns of a fluted design are set around this library.  Large
arched windows lie between the columns.  Shelves of mahogany wood hold these
fine leather bound books behind brass railings.  There are not many books in
this library and it is used primarily for reading.  In the center of the room
is a brightly polished brass book stand that holds an open book.  The royal
librarians from other countries sometimes exchange books or make copies of
books available for scribes to copy.  Large silk pillows of red and edged in
gold with gold tassels upon each corner lie below some of the windows.  A tea
service lies upon a table between two of the marble columns.

      <roomdescription>The high dome like ceiling help give this room its name.  Causal speech can be
heard at any place in the room as if it were whispers.  Even late at night,
some servants have claimed to hear whispers of those who lived long ago and
stayed in this manor.  In the center of the room is an alabaster statue of two
sisters, one whispering in the other&apos;s ear.  Upon the walls are tapestries,
evocative of the old Tairen ones often seen in the houses of Tear&apos;s nobility.
A marble fireplace crowns one of the walls, while a scattering of plush velvet
sofas and chairs offer a stately retreat for the manor&apos;s nobility.

oval window, amber in color from dust and lack of cleaning.  The sun shines
through this window washing the whole hayloft in a mellow gold.

with copper buckets of water and cakes of soap washing down any dirt or dust
from the carriages, while others change wheels and make other minor repairs.

      <roomdescription>This enchanted garden blooms in the Winter.  Delicate glass sculptures of
tigers, wolves, and other animals seem as if they are carved from ice.  Trees
embraced by glass ice, spangle even the night with whorls of crystal branches.
A leaf here and there flashes silver or gold like some strange jewel that grows
only in the coldest night.  Snow hares of glass freeze in one&apos;s wake.  In the
center is a sculpture of horses white as hoarfrost in caught in a moment of
fluid motion.  Their eyes are crystal-fire and have wild manes that seem to
catch dark wind, snow and falling stars.  One can almost imagine the swirling,
misty ribbons of snow.

looking glasses just like some of the noble commanders use on the battlefield.
Only these are very large and made so one can see beyond the city walls.  On a
clear night, one can see all the stars in the sky.  And on magical summer
nights the orchestra might play up here and dazzle all of Caemlyn.

marble that is cool to the touch and extends up the walls and high vaulted
ceiling.  In the walls are carved niches that house a variety of caskets that
used to contain fabulous wealth.  Today, these caskets form a collection each
with its own story.  There is a silver casket with an intricate lock that once
held the wedding bands of some Andoran noble couple.  Another casket shaped
like a ship once held a map of the trade winds, long lost.  Still another
casket of alabaster once contained the love letters of a certain noble lady
that caused quite a scandal at Court.  In the center of the hall is a dark blue
marble pedestal upon which is large casket carved from animal horn, its lid
translucent while the base is covered in velvet and contains a crystal decanter
of wine and several fluted glasses.

comfortable and perhaps custom made. Behind the desk is a window over-looking 
the practice yards, and to either side of the window is a large map, to the 
right is a map of the nation of Andor, to the left one of Caemlyn. Above the 
window is a banner of blue, with a white sword facing point down, entwined 
with roses to the hilt. Against one of the other walls is a bookshelf, bearing 
books on tactics, law, geography, and some others that appear to be log-books 
regarding the Guard itself. Across from the bookshelf is a side table, flanked 
on either side by chairs up against the wall, above the table is a banner 
bearing the White Lion of Andor. Next to the desk is a sturdy, but small,
weapons rack.

of Andor.  Within the latticed gazebo is a intricate scroll worked swing just
large enough to seat two.  Near the bridge is a wrought-iron table patterned
like rose briars surrounded by matching chairs with red cushions edged in gold.

This small room seems to have been carefully decorated by someone with an eye
for style.  It seems a tidy place clothes neatly stacked on top of a cupboard
in a corner, bed made, a few books piled together.  The single bed standing at
the left wall is covered in a blue woven blanket, matching the small
rugs placed at intervals around the floor.  A wall hanging with
simple, repeating patterns of interlocking green spirals covers
part of one wall, above a small table scattered with a few possessions.  A
cloth sack hangs from a peg, strong herbal smells coming from it a
pestle and mortar rests on the table.  Erana&apos;s room seems impressed with her
presence, from the colorful cloth on the walls to the
carefully-positioned chairs by the table.

Over the windows hangs a silken curtain is a deep navy blue shade that absorbs 
the light trying to enter the room but brightens it enough to see easily during 
the day.  Against the far wall is a the day.  Against the far wall is a Large
bed with a cannopy over it.  The bed has large fluffy pillows and a thin silk blanket 
with two crystal goblets on it.  A few chairs sit around a small desk in the corner.
The walls of the room have various paintings and tapestries hanging on them 
that seem to depict various scenes in which there is one prevalent emotion.
Each one has a different overlaying emotion.

is large \c03leather chair\c00 behind a long \c03o\c09a\c03k\c00 desk, that is made

map of the Andor and its surrounding lands posted on the wall.

      <roomdescription>The hall of houses is somber with the continuous drone of houses carved into
the granite walls.  Some of the houses no longer exist because of no heirs and
others simply disappeared, while others were exterminated.  Major houses as
well as minor houses are chiseled into the walls.  There is nothing else in
this room.  It stands as it is, a monument to the noble houses all across the

that has three red slashes on a field of black hung on the East wall of the
room.  Under the rug is a long blue couch that is finely stitched.  Across from
the couch is a small table, with two small wooden chairs and two large
comfortable looking chair pulled around it.  On the table are a few papers and
a quill pen standing in a small cup of ink.  To the North wall is a -VERY-
large case reaching from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, with two clear
window doors on it that are clearly sealed by an iron lock.  Inside the right
half of the case is a fine assortment of weapons, some bows, a quiver with
arrows in it, a couple swords, and many, many daggers, each looking more
dangerous then the first.  On the left half of the case is a large medley of
bottles, each labeled, you can make out the words Hemlock, Arsenic, and Tares
on a couple of the bottles.  The last piece of furniture is a small bed with
black sheets, not too fancy, just a place to rest.

      <roomdescription>As you enter the room, the first thing that becomes visible to you is a large
window, composed of a number of large panes of clear glass.  It&apos;s fitted with
heavy red velvet draperies that can be drawn closed to provide privacy, and
which match nicely with the deep grey of the dressed stone walls.  Hangings
depicting various battle scenes vie for attention along the walls, next to
other draperies that seem to depict scenes from various legends and tales.  
One wall of the room is cleared completely except for various simply made
weapons that are racked neatly on its surface.  There&apos;s a pair of light
daggers, a short spear, and one or two odd weapons of Mayener origin that have
a decidedly evil look to them.  The floor space is divided into several areas.
One section is equipped with a small bookcase, and several comfortable chairs
next to a simply made mahogany table.  The next section of the room is devoid
of all furniture, and free of rugs to warm the cold floor.  The heaviest
concentration of the weapons on the wall is here, making it likely that it is
often used for practice space in the occupant&apos;s leisure.  Further towards the
window (the room is arranged so that the sitting area is closest to the door)
lies a large bed with an iron frame, headboard, and footboard.  Next to it is a
small dressing table, and across the room is a wardrobe of polished, stained
mahogany to provide a place for clothing.

      <roomdescription>   Both the antechamber and bedroom of this apartment are sparsely decorated
with only the essentials and what seems to have been there before someone moved
in. In fact, the antechamber appears to contain more accessories than the
private rooms themselves. This portal before the hallway is carpeted a thick
royal blue. A well-laid brick fireplace rests within a side wall, two
expensive leather chairs angled to face both it and each other with a small
folding table between, often carrying a silver tray with wine and glasses.
   The bedroom beyond a closeable door is about three times aas large as the
antechamber, noting it a definite master bedroom of the manor. The floor is
carpeted in the same thick blue up to where it meets a raised dais, two wide
tiled steps attached to the walls and leading up to glass doors that open onto
a balcony. The drapes are made of silvery silk and are most often tied
carefully to two marble pillars framing the doors. An ornate cherry wood table
resides on the opposite side, resting up against a matching wardrobe. The top
of it is almost always bare save some loose papers and a glass vase holding
a single rose. Another leather armchair sits in one corner, small enough to be
moved about the room. One final piece of furniture is a large double posted
bed, dark blue and silver covers perfectly turned down as if they are hardly
ever disturbed by anyone sleeping in them. Light streams in both day and night
from the balcony doors, giving little need to the candle and torch holders
on the walls.

      <roomdescription>  Both the head and foot of this bed is made of bright silver, and it stays
bright because the servants keep it polished and free of tarnish.  The head
of the bed has a rising sun with all the rays and the foot of the bed is
smooth while the posts are fluted.  The floor mirror is beveled and set in a
silver frame.  Two chairs in the room are also silver and covered with a
pastel blue and white pattern almost like what one would expect to find on
china.  The sofa coordinates nicely with the chairs and the tables are all
silver with beveled glassed tops.  The fireplace and crown molding is
wrought in silver lilies.  This room has a quaint balcony that the west
wall opens onto and which is quiet pleasant for breakfast and sunset
dinners.

      <roomdescription>The central room is long, high and narrow.  All around the circular center are
arched columns of polished blue marble with gold inlaid bands at the top and
bottom.  Above the arched columns rise a second story of arched columns of red
marble edged in gold.  The ceiling is a dome encrusted with jeweled mosaics.  
Polished brass oil lamps upon ornate floor stands, give light to this room.  
In the center lie carved platforms of red marble rimmed with double bands of
gold, upon which the newly dead are placed before permanent burial in the
crypts.  Kneeling benches padded with soft blue velvet are to the north of the
platforms.  At the far north is a niche in the wall that houses the burial
chalice kept filled with a deep red wine.  Beyond the arches lies a hallway
along which are the ornately carved crypts.

      <roomdescription>Thick furs cover nearly every inch of this rooms walls, as to keep out the
Saldaean cold, a huge unlit fireplace nearly fills the back wall, logs in it,
ready to be lit if the weather ever turns colder.  A large yet practical bed
sits quietly in one corner, the bedclothes arranged in a soldierly order.  A
large wooden chest sits in front of the bed, it may contain anything from a
spare lance to a small pouch, judging from its size.  The room is much like the
aging general, well appointed, noble, yet somehow imposing, and collected.

      <roomdescription>This a more solitary section of the private rooms of Kier Dalwen is
surprisingly as neat and organized as his others, if even less decorative.  
Its paneled walls are bare of pictures or even hangings and tapestries, though
a few oddly colored patches show signs that some items have hung there in the
past.  Lights have been placed in smoky glass orbs to spread their
effectiveness in a most common sense manner, the devices held on light chains
from the ceiling.  A single bay window pushes outwards from its wall, silvery
silk curtains draping across a black tassled pillow that pads the alcove formed
there.  It looks a perfect place to read, though by the appearance of a very
full, though well organized desk, the owner of this room probably never uses
it.  The floor bares its wooden self to walking feet, no rugs laid, a sign of
Kier&apos;s personal taste for necessities over extravagances.

    <roombasic title="The Bedchambers of the High Magistrate, Lord Barengin" vnum="839" zone="7">
      <roomdescription>The floor forms a mosaic of the Taravin House Crest in inlaid woods.  The walls
are bare except for a family painting depicting Barengin, his brothers Brelon,
Kevorin, Brennon, his niece Zaria, and his parents Gregris Taravin and
Madailyss Brandt.  Of course, everyone in the painting is much younger by at
least ten years.  A simple fireplace with a mantle over it is on one wall.  
Upon the mantle are a number of smaller paintings of family members and a few
candlestands made of pewter.  Near the great arched window is a wooden desk,
simple but elegant in its design.  Atop the desk is a small hutch that contains
a journal and a couple of prized books, including one on Andoran Law.  There is
a small wooden tray on the desk that contains a number of offical looking
papers in elegant parchments.  The desk chair has a worn cushioned seat of red
velvet, a gift from his mother.  The bed is a simple narrow one with four
fluted posts that form a canopy from which white drapes trimmed in red and gold
fall.  The drapes are used in the winter to keep away any drafts.  A small
washstand is near the bed with a white porcelain bowl and pitcher, below which
are a couple of clean towels.  At the foot of the bed is a finely tooled
leather trunk with pewter fittings.  Inside the trunk are additional blankets
and bedding.  Along the wall is wardrobe with simple lines and little carving
except for the lions that form the feet.  Inside the wardrobe are a number of
clothing items including court uniforms.

      <roomdescription>The office of the Cairhienin Ambassador is fashioned in the expensive, if
austere decor typical of his homeland.  The floor is covered in large tiles of
\c22black\c00 marble with \c08dark red\c00 veins streaking through it, and is
bare of coverings.  A large writing desk made of \c22ebony\c00 dominates the
center of the room, along with a \c12v\c08e\c12l\c08v\c12e\c08t\c00 cushioned,
high-backed chair carved of the same wood.  The desk is bare except for an
\c14i\c04nkwel\c14l\c00 with a long \c13f\c12e\c13a\c08t\c13h\c12e\c13r\c00
quill resting in it, a neat stack of unused \c14paper\c00, and a small
\c10candle\c00 in a \c03gold\c00 candleholder.  A pair of smaller, and less
comfortable looking chairs sit in front of the desk.  A large
\c02g\c04l\c02o\c04b\c02e\c00 stand sits on one side of the desk, while an
empty \c10book\c00 stand sits on the other.  A small table stands against the
south wall, the top inlaid with \c10e\c08x\c10o\c08t\c10i\c08c
\c10w\c08o\c10o\c08d\c10s\c00 in the pattern of a \c14stones\c00 board.  
Several pieces lie on strategic points of the board, apparently part of an
unfinished game.  \c10Bookshelves\c00 line the rest of the walls, broken only
by a tall rectangular window with an empty birdcage resting on the sill.

large, tinted window, bathing the room in a warm rose color.  Everything along
walls from the dresser, the bedposts, the mirror frame and even the door
handles, all of which are intricately carved into beautiful arrangements and

      <roomdescription>This is an odd shaped room with the southeast door flanked by two large
marble pillars.  The floor is also marble and there are no rugs upon the floor,
but there are a number of plants some of which are in a crude imitation of
seafolk porcelain.  There are a few red velvet chairs with their carved lion-
head arms.  A fireplace lies along the eastern wall.  Except for the eastern
wall, this room is enclosed with glass panes.  This room is often used for 
drawing and there are a number of easels with canvases upon them as well
as boxes of paints and various brushes.  Sometimes the room is used to teach
the noble children the finer points of dancing or for private lessons in singing,
playing a musical instrument, writing poetry and developing a fine penmanship.
To the north lies courtyards and to the south lies a garden.

      <roomdescription>Housed within this large cupola are twelve bells.  Uniformed bell ringers are
specially trained to pulled the silk cords of these silver bells.  Each bell
has been carefully etched with Andoran symbols and episodes from her history.
The bells are rung first in the morning, then the midmorning bells, the high
bells, the prime bells, the second bells and finally the trine bells are rung.
Wooden louvers protect the bells from the weather and lets the sound fill the
Caemlyn streets.  Not only do the bell ringers ring the bells they are also
responsible for their maintenance.  A spiral staircase leads up to the belfry.
The sheer size of the bells are a marvel to behold.

hidden in tastefulness, rather than gaudy displays of gold.  The main room here
is dark and somber, the carpet of a deep green, the walls and ceiling painted
in the same sober hew.  The wooden chairs, scattered in various places
throughout the room, are intricately carved and show a master&apos;s skill in the
fanciful depictions of a number of different animals, that have been inscribed
upon the backs.  The majority of the floor space is free, of clutter, a
comfortable looking pair of couches, facing each other against the southern
wall, have been thoughtfully placed near the large sideboard, which holds
dozens of various bottles of different types of alcohol.  The thick carpet
mutes the sounds of footsteps, giving the room a peculiar and peaceful silence.
Doors to the east and west, lead into adjoining rooms that appear to be
similarly appointed, at least where the color of carpeting and wall are
concerned.

glowing coals below the floor.  The tub is oval shaped and filled with aqua
water.  Black marble polished like a reflecting mirror forms the floor.  One
semi-circular bench of polished granite flanks the bath.  A round window rimmed
in gold bands like port holes of a ship grace two of the walls and over look
the gardens below.  A large fireplace trimmed in polished brass lies along one
of the walls.  Around the bath are candles, scented soaps, bath sponges, bath
oils, scented lotions, bath spices, chilled wine and crystal goblets.

      <roomdescription>This is a large bedroom, its centerpiece being a huge four poster bed,
with drawn sheer bed curtains. The light from outside is supplied 
through two huge French doors east, which open up to view the gardens
below.  Across from the bed is a tall dressing screen, taunt material 
pulled tightly, the center is painted with the image of a peacock. 
Next to the screen is a golden dressing table, with an assortment of 
paints, powders, and scents. Next to this stands a huge full 
length mirror inset into a teak frame. A massive rug made from the 
skin of a large striped cat graces the center of the room, and seems to 
invite one to lounge in front of the ivory hearthed fireplace.

      <roomdescription>This is a rather dark, cramped room, cluttered would best describe it. 
Empty brandy bottles, dirty clothes, torn parchments and broken items litter
the floor. A large \c03poster bed\c00 with \c04dark curtains\c00 is built into the corner
by a thin window overlooking the stables.  A full standing Armoire,carved with
strange designs stands by the window.  Across from the Armoire is a rather
large desk with many small drawers and spaces, most of them locked. Several
chairs uphostered in \c23water-\c01silk\c00 and edged in burnished \c10gold\c00, appear to be 
rather worn. On the wall is a large \c03parchment Map\c00 of the known World,
marked with \c11Nations\c00 and \c03borders\c00 and \c10trade routes\c00 and various locations
stuck with \c01pins\c00. Upon the \c03floor\c00 is a thick rug with \c01red\c00 and \c23black designs\c00.
A \c10gold\c00 fluted stand for holding canes knocked over, it&apos;s contents
splayed on the floor. Obviously a maid has not been in here for some time.

      <roomdescription>This room is approximately thirty feet wide, by fifty feet deep and ten
feet high.  Resting in the midst of the northern wall of this chamber, is
a bed which almost seems to dominate the entirety of the room.  The
bed frame is wrought of &amp;Wc&amp;Co&amp;Wl&amp;Cd&amp;k i&amp;wr&amp;ko&amp;wn&amp;n while situated within the frame are
several matteresses, achieving a rather comfortable look.  Atop of the
mattresses, are &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wk&amp;We&amp;wn &amp;Wsh&amp;wee&amp;Wts&amp;n, while above those are &amp;yr&amp;Yi&amp;yc&amp;Yh&amp;n blankets, and
several thick, feather pillows.  Immediately to the left of the dominating
bed is a &amp;yw&amp;goo&amp;yd&amp;ge&amp;yn&amp;n stand, with several levels of shelves, while atop each of
the shelves are various bits and pieces of scattered miscellany.  Against
the eastern wall, rests a large desk which rests in about the rough
center, with a large, &amp;kb&amp;ml&amp;ka&amp;mc&amp;kk l&amp;me&amp;ka&amp;mt&amp;kh&amp;me&amp;kr&amp;n chair resting nearby.  Another chair,
sits in the northeastern corner of the room, but this chair is of simple
wood with padded armrests.  Against the western wall of the room, rests a
large, oaken dresser, with several drawers and atop it, rests a large
&amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;Wy &amp;Cm&amp;Wi&amp;Cr&amp;Wr&amp;Co&amp;Wr&amp;n.  Each of the four walls in the room are painted in a &amp;Rf&amp;Yi&amp;We&amp;Yr&amp;Ry&amp;r
r&amp;Re&amp;rd&amp;n color, while the rich, plush carpet matches the coloring of the walls.
Standing in both the southwestern corner and southeastern corner of the
room are to large, &amp;yg&amp;Yo&amp;yl&amp;Yd&amp;ye&amp;Yn&amp;n candelabra, with many &amp;Rf&amp;Yl&amp;Wi&amp;Yc&amp;Wk&amp;Re&amp;Yr&amp;Wi&amp;Yn&amp;Rg&amp;n candles.  Set
in the middle of the southern wall, is a large, oaken door, with a shiny
brass doorknob and lock.

the mouth-watering game fills the air.  The cracking and popping of the fire as
it dances along the dry wood can be hear.  Over to one side are the pot
scrubbers who are leaning elbow deep in black cauldrons of soapy water,
scouring a pile of pots and pans.
