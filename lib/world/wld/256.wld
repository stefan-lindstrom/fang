      <roomdescription>This is a gigantic, open, squarish area with roads leading to the
north, south, east and west.  The Square is tiled with flagstone and
in almost the direct center is a large marble fountain.  In the
fountain, there is a large marble statue of a lion reared up on its
hind legs and with its paws extended, water gushing forth from its
mouth and down into the base of the fountain.  Coins of differing
variety are scattered along the bottom and glint in the sunlight.  
Miners and other travellers often pass through this area on their
ways to go about their day to day existence.  Varying carts and
coaches pass through often as well with miscellaneous symbols etched
upon them proclaiming ownership.  To each direction, north, east,
south and west there are buildings along either side of the road,
forming almost a barrier to the area, while archways span across the
gaps over the street.  Several men dressed in round steel caps and
studded leather jerkins who carry quarterstaves, stand at each of the
four directional entrances with their wary eyes scanning about for
wrongdoing.

the walls of the wooden palisades that run to either the south or the east.  
Men are visible within the Watch-tower, showing signs of being part of the
Local Militia.  The Area itself is vast and open, dead grass scattered about
and cleared.  To the southeast is visible the corner of Starlit Street and
Miner&apos;s Avenue.  This area is essentially dead of activity, excepting for the
occasional passerby, or perhaps a child and dog playing, but otherwise this
area is devoid of activity.

east or the west.  Directly eastwards, Miner&apos;s Avenue meets Smelter&apos;s
Street, forming a corner of sorts, while westwards, Miner&apos;s Avenue will
eventually converge with Main Street to form a four-way intersection.  To
the north, wooden palisades have been erected, effectively barring passage
to enter or exit the City of Baerlon while directly to the south, a large
city block is visible.  The city block is composed of many buildings of
various sizes and shapes and many twisting, spidery alleyways run between
them.  Along either the north or south sides of the road, wooden posts
have been driven into the ground, while lanterns hang from them, keeping
the area well-lit even during the darkest hours of night.

to stand out as well, but as to the reasons why that would have to be
further investigated.  Traffic in the area is rather heavy, people, wagons

Almost seeming to dominate this area is a gigantic, pristinely cleansed

comprise the roof of the building are all well-maintained as well as being
that same white color.  There are two windows on the front side of the
building, while looking in them would reveal a very lavish and richly
decorated room.  Aside from the building there are several other buildings
that don&apos;t hold as much attention, as they do not really seem to stand
out, although the area is quite thickly packed with them.  Traffic in the
area is rather heavy, people wandering about the area and oftentimes into
the pristine white building to whatever end.

area as well, wearing leather jerkins and bearing quarterstaves as
they go about looking for wrongdoing.  Wooden posts stand at regular
intervals, bearing lanterns which illuminate areas at night, casting
eery shadows amongst the alleyways that are visible along both the
east and west sides of the road.  Visible to the west, is a large
building with a sign out in front of it and loud, raucous laughter
echoing from it.

sign out front, proudly displaying the name &quot;&amp;cThe &amp;WStag&amp;c and &amp;yLion&amp;n&quot; There are
other buildings on this street-corner as well, but none are as notable as
the Inn.  To the southwest, is the gigantic Center Square of Baerlon,
while to the west is the Main Street which runs either north and south,
while to the south Baerlon Avenue runs east or west.  Notably the Inn
seems almost at all times occupied by the general sort that often inhabits
towns like Baerlon.  Loud, raucous laughter seems to perpetuate the area,
while the windows flicker with torchlight within.  Often are there people
wandering through the area on their way towards the &amp;cThe &amp;WStag&amp;c and &amp;yLion&amp;n Inn,
generally ignoring the other various buildings about the area.

To the south Baerlon Avenue runs either east or west, while to the east Smelter&apos;s
Street runs north and south. Amongst the buildings in this area, one specifically
draws attention, that building being three levels high compared to the normality
of only single or dual-levelled buildings. The three-levelled building is also distinctly
different as it seems to have been built from brick, and the roof is shingled instead
of simply tiled, forming into an apex. A large wooden post is driven into the ground
before the building, depicting a battered sign which seems to have been worn by
the passage of many summers.

scattered and twisting alleyways run amongst the various buildings on
either the east or west side of it.  Long wooden poles, stand in
various places with a lantern which at night illuminates the
surrounding areas and casts eery shadows through the area.  Towards
the north is the large Center Square of Baerlon while towards the
south is the Southern Gate.  In the northern portion of this area,
there is an archway which rises between two buildings on the corner,
forming an arch over the flagstone tiled road, with various
decorations that occasionally hang from it.  Coaches, carts and
wagons pass through here led by their teams of horses as they go
about their daily business

sturdy.  There are benches along each of the various walls within while in
the middle of the wooden floor of the tower there is a square hole with a
wooden ladder leading down to the ground beneath.  The ladder, is attached
with hooks to the watch-tower and easily could be lifted up into the tower
in times of war.  There are lanterns hanging from dark chains at each of
the four corners of the watch-tower while within easy reach, hanging from
pegs on the walls at various intervals are quivers of arrows while bows
are placed nearby them.

Various shelves and stands seem to occupy almost the entirety of the

southern portion of the room.  Behind the wooden desk rests a finely
crafted chair.  Along each of the walls, excepting the southern, the

armor, although leather, or hard leather seems to be the most common.  On
some of the various stands, sets of chain or even a few suits of plate
armor are able to be viewed.

Towards the southern portion of this building is an almost gigantic

      <roomdescription>This building appears large from the outside but upon entering it appears even
more massive as the main room of this building is rather gigantic, although
much of the space therein is used by scattered odds and ends.  On either side
of the front door, there are stands displaying various bits of armor and
weaponry apparently forged by the smith.  Along each of the east and west walls
are cabinets and shelves, containing various odds and ends, bits of metal,
tools, iron-working tools, buckets of water and the like.  In almost the center
of this building a large anvil is set into the floor, two buckets of water
close to it, one filled with saltwater and the other with just plain water.  
Resting near the anvil is a stand with several types of hammers, files and
other iron-working equipment.  Towards the back of the room, about mid-center
is a large wooden shelf which spans almost the length of the whole width of the
room, while there is a glass-pained counter and behind it resting upon the
floor is an iron-strongbox.  Along the back wall several aprons as well as
several mixed types of armor and weapons hang from iron hooks.

only illumination herein is the lantern which seems to be running low on
oil.  Resting against the southern wall is a large desk with a chair
resting behind it.  The desk itself is finely crafted and stury looking,
built of thick oak and several draws line it.  The whole of the desk is
covered by a scattering of papers and the like along with several pens and
an inkwell.  The shelves which line the area are covered by things of a
mundane sort, although amongst them lie unfinished horseshoes, weapons,
bits and scraps of armor and the like.  Resting beneath the shelves in the
southwestern corner of his room is a large chest with a large, shiny
padlock.

Directly west of the bar is a small stage with a comfortable appearing
chair.  Set into each of the east or west walls are doorways leading to
private dining chambers.  Within this area, tables are spaced about in a
neat, even kind of way, while at each of the various tables several chairs
rest.  The room itself is somewhat dim at the best lit of times,
flickering torches at random intervals along each of the four walls,
&amp;Ks&amp;mh&amp;Ka&amp;md&amp;Ko&amp;mw&amp;Ks&amp;n eerily casting about the area.  Loud raucous laughter can be heard
emanating from seemingly all directions as the Inn of the Welcome Wench

about, often entering the northern door behind the bar and returning with
large trays of steaming food, briskly serving their patrons.

oaken chairs with cushions, lining both east and west sides and a
single, larger chair rests at both the north and south ends.  
Candelabra line the walls of this room while candles of various hues
and scents rest within and give off a faint incense while they
illuminate the room with dim, flickering light that casts the
occasional eerie shadow along any of the four walls.  Rowdy noise can
be heard from behind the southern door while light talk and
occasional laughter, intermingled with the sounds of pots and pans
clanging about echoes from behind the north door.

feet deep and fifteen feet high.  Against the north wall rests a
small, but comfortable-looking bed with fresh sheets and a rough
woolen blanket, while at the head of it rests a worn-looking feather
pillow.  Nearly hidden beneath the bed is a dark, clay chamberpot
which appears to be oft used.  Next to the bed, resting against the
east wall there is a wooden stand with two shelves.  Upon the higher
level of the shelf there is an unburned candle and upon the lower
level of it there is a clay basin filled with water.  In the
southeast corner there is an oaken rack with pegs, for the purpose of
hanging coats while opposite is a well-kept oaken dresser containing
a few meager towels and wash rags.  In the south wall of the room
there is set into it, an oaken door with a shiny brass knob.

      <roomdescription>This is a large, spacious chamber of a fine quality.  Iron wall
cressets holding torches are set in various areas along the walls
while on a stand in the northwest corner a large candle rests.  The
northern portion of the room seems almost wholly dominated by the
large, decorated iron-grillwork bed with long, thick blankets resting
upon it.  Peeking out from beneath the edge of the bed is a bedpan
while on the eastern side of the bed rests yet another wooden stand
with a large washbasin.  A wooden coat-rack rests in the southeast
corner of the room, while opposite it in the southwest corner rests a
large, oaken dresser.  In the north wall is set a small window
overlooking the warren of alleyways below, while in the south wall a
large door is set.

      <roomdescription>This room can easily be described as elegant, as per the finery
displayed easily about the area.  Wall hangings and rugs,
candlesticks and other various fineries are displayed here with
apparent casualness.  A gigantic bed dominates the northern portion
of this room with an iron-grillwork frame and overhanging canopy.  
Silks adorn the canopy, rustling lightly with a slight breeze that
pours in from a moderately opened window which is set into the
northern wall.  On either the west or eastern side of the beds, oaken
stands rest, each with a washbasin, bedpan and several miscellaneous
drawers containing towels and the like.  A large expansive oaken
dresser rests against the western wall with several empty drawers
while opposite it, a large, finely carved desk with matching chairs
rests.  A small oaken table rests not far southwards from the desk
with several candles sitting atop of it.  In the southwest corner
rests a large oaken stand with several pegs and hooks, while opposite
it, in the southeast corner rests a wellkempt floormat.  In the
center of the southern wall, is set a large, thick, oaken doorway
with a silvery doorknob which often catches the flickering
candlelight.

      <roomdescription>This thirty foot wide, by thirty foot long by fifteen foot high room
can only be considered sparse and rather unadorned with finery.  A
comfortable-looking bed rests against the south walls with fresh
sheets and rough wool blankets, while at its headboard a worn-looking
feather pillow rests.  Beneath the bed and barely visible is a dark
clay chamberpot, which appears to have been recently cleaned.  Next
to the bed, resting against the eastern wall is a small stand,
occupied by a candle, while beneath on a lower shelf is a small basin
filled with water.  In the northwest corner of the room there is an
carved oak coat-rack.  There is a dresser resting along the west
wall, appearing to be decently upkept.  In the south wall, towards
the foot of the bed and about six feet from the ground is a small
window, which overlooks Baerlon Avenue.  In the north wall, there is
an oaken door with a shiny, brass doorknob.

a pale, ivory tile while the walls are patterned in various hues of light
blues, light greens and light reds.  Four sets of candelabra rest in each
of the four corners of the room, each bedecked with flickering candles
which seem to be maintained thoroughly at all times of day.  A desk rests
perhaps ten feet before the door which is set into the western wall, with
a beautiful, if perhaps slightly aged woman sitting behind it.

benches as well as wooden stands which hold a panoply of various items.  
Items commonly found upon the wooden stands could be things such as:
towels, scented soaps, oils, towels, brushes and the like.  Steam lightly
floats about the room, keeping the room in an almost constant state of
moist, humidity, while often bath attendants flit about the area, bringing
hot water and pouring it into the large pool within the center of the
room.  The room is colored in various light and easy shades which could
perhaps give a serene, calm feeling in one of the various patrons.  Set
into each of the northern, southern, western and eastern walls is a door
of a varying hue, while a staircase leads upwards to a second level.

directly beneath a series of shelves, a series of wooden chairs rest as if
waiting to be used to replace chairs from the main room.  Aside from all

      <roomdescription>  The room is furnished with a small desk in one corner, and a soft

the floor. A \c07w\c14i\c07n\c14d\c07o\c14w\c00 faces the west and looks out upon an alley where 
several piles of trash and debris sit. You wonder briefly if there are 
many \c03rats\c00 in the alley and decide you shouldnt have to worry being so
high up about leaving your \c07w\c14i\c07n\c14d\c07o\c14w\c00 opened. The walls are a swirled \c03t\c10a\c03n\c00  
and \c01r\c08e\c01d\c00 color with a painting of a young man resting on a \c03b\c10e\c03n\c10c\c03h\c00 hung on
one wall. A shelf holding a few small \c03w\c10o\c03o\c10d\c03 c\c10a\c03r\c10v\c03i\c10n\c03g\c10s\c00 is on another wall
and a \c01f\c08i\c01r\c08e\c01p\c08l\c01a\c08c\c01e\c00 crackles cheerfully in the southern part of the room.
South is a doorway most likely leading into a dressing chamber.

by several torches mounted on either side of the wall between
the doors. There are small round \c03t\c10a\c03b\c10l\c03e\c10s\c00 with \c09vases\c00 of \c01f\c07l\c01o\c07w\c01e\c07r\c01s\c00
sitting between the doorways on each side and the carpet looks
less worn with the wear of feet and \c23boots\c00 treading on it than
the one on the second floor. An elaborately framed \c13m\c07i\c13r\c07r\c13o\c07r\c00 is here 
trimmed in \c10gold\c00 making the hallway seem larger and longer than 
it really is. To the south is a closed door.

upon seeing within.  The area is richly attired, the floor being covered
by a rich, thick carpet, while the walls are attired with various
wall-hangings and tapestries.  &amp;WS&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;Wy&amp;n candelabra are spread out in
various intervals within the area, all the candles within them well tended
and lit, their flames flickering at every stray gust of wind, but a rich
illumination shines through the whole area.  Almost seeming to dominate
the room is a gigantic desk, while at each side of the desk a large,
rather bulky man stands.  Each of the two men have a rather blocky build,
and stoney face, with eyes that seem to peer into the soul of each
customer.  Behind the desk sits a small, almost delicate female who looks
up from her work at the entrance of each new customer.  Behind the woman
and desk stands a large portcullis-like gate which blocks entrance into
the vault behind.
