\c05The trees grow closer together here, making \c23pools of shadows\c00\c05
beneath their branches. Through the trees you can see a mountain
pass that leads deeper into this \c02m\c05a\c02l\c05e\c02v\c05o\c02l\c05e\c02n\c05t jungle. A \c03small
boulder\c05 has been set here with something etched into it.\c00

anything. A mountain range looms over the top of the
trees, a \c07haze\c05 of some sort surrounding them.\c00

of the blight.  To the east and west the Mountains of Dhoom rise up to
form virtual walls hemming you in.  A dense patch of somewhat malevolent
trees blocks your passage north, but you can go around to the northeast

\c23As the trail continues it becomes more narrow, each step
seeming to bring you closer to the jagged edges of the rocky
wall. The great peak of one of the southern most summits of
the Mountains of Dhoom soon presents itself. None but fools 
would climb its sheer sides even if it could be traversed. To
the east the ridgeline winds its way down to a lower part of
the chain and to the northwest the treacherous trail 
converges with yet another juncture. The bitter cold of the
shadows seems almost a relief from the exhaustive heat of the
\c05Great Blight.\c00

feels as if it has been sharpened with an edge as keen as 
knife. To the east and west the ridgeline rises up and 
continues. The vast expanse of the \c05Great Blight\c23 lay to
the south.\c00

\c23Yet another shrill scream of a pedetor shatters the cool
air of the Mountain reaches. The sound seems to echo around
the valley around you and almost intensify with each second.
To the north the path becoems more treacherous because of it, 
many of the large jagged rocks that make up the valley walls
appear to shift and move as the soundwaves collide. The only 
other path twists its way westward.\c00

Seemingly devoid of life for the moment the ground looks almost

carries heavily the \c10s\c23t\c10e\c23n\c10c\c23h of \c01death\c23 and \c04decay\c23 from the vile and

\c23A lone peak of the beginnings of the great chain known as
the Mountains of Dhoom rises beneath your feet. Although not as
large as some that appear in the far northwest, it is nevertheless
higher than most mountains of the soft lands to the south. The 
high vantage point offers you some overview of what lays around
but with the wavering of the hot humid air the very trees 
themselves seem to shift and move. A narrow path leads off to
the east and another to the northwest, each heading into the \c05Blight\c23
proper once more.\c00

hunting animal nearby is answered by a dozen more, whatever
is out there hunting the hunters is a dire threat indeed. 
To the southwest an unstable rock formation rises up and what
could be the beginning of an arm of the \c23Mountains of Dhoom  \c05
rise up from the dense rotting vegetation to the west. Only
the vile corruption of the Blight is seen to the east.\c00

\c05The Great Blight continues all around you making it almost
impossible to see where the narrow trails between the trees
and rocks lead. Distant howls of hunting animals and the 
stench of dead and rotting vegetation seem to be warning you
it is not safe to stand still, even more a moment.\c00

\c05The twisting trail between the dense trees suddenly widens
into a small clearing. Within its centre sparkle a small \c13p\c14o\c13n\c14d\c05,
colourful \c10f\c09l\c08o\c13w\c08e\c09r\c10s\c05 and \c02r\c03e\c02e\c03d\c02s\c05 growing all around. The water seems
to ripple and move as if something swims beneath its waters but
nothing rises to the surface. What could be the dull gleam of
\c07bones\c05 scatter fitfully on the edge of the shallow end. The
jungle of the Blight continues in every direction.\c00

on the edge of the path covered in a \c01rust

\c05The path between the dense trees continues fitfully, vines and
branches seeming to almost try and reach out towards you as you
pass. With more frequency the stark white of \c07bones\c05 litter the
ground, an oddity so far into the Blight for most creatures eat
their prey whole. The humid air does not even seem to move, no
breeze seems strong enough to swift the thick and heavy blanket
of death and decay. A trail winds its way in what you guess is 
northwest and others to the south and north.\c00

\c05A shrill high pitched scream of a tortured animal filters through
the dense vegetation. Its cry seems to sound only moments before 
being suddenly cut off. All beasts are predetors in the Great Blight
and even the trees kill for food. The \c23Dark One's\c05 touch seems all
around you, the corruption so bad in places that a dozen leaves and
rotten fruit fall to the ground as you pass. A small trail winds its
wall through their branches towards the north and another vaguely in
the south.\c00

northeast. Stark, black rock begins slowly but then rises to jagged
and twisted peaks, there summits well above the level of the Great 
Blight. In all other directions from you the shrill cries of
primiative hunting creatures can be heard, ever searching for food.
In the south however the more bloodthirst and intelligent cries 
for blood can be heard in a harsh gutteral tongue.\c00

The Eye of the World~
\c02The last traces of the \c09Nym's power\c00\c02 are still here, holding off the
\c05blight\c02 and the \c01Dark One's\c23 taint\c00\c02. A huge Oak tree, well over one 
hundred feet tall provides shade. \c07Mushrooms\c02, which look edible, grow
all over the place. A small \c04pool of clear water\c02 provides water. This
appears to be a sanctuary from the \c05Blight\c02. While you can still hear
the creatures outside, you feel safe and peaceful here.\c00

Deep beneath Shayol Ghul~
Molten heat rises from the lava boiling in the center of
this massive cavern. A small outcropping of rock juts out
of the wall, giving one person barely enough room to stand.
A feeling of undeniable evil permeates the atmosphere of
this vast room, leaving all who enter with a feeling of
utter despair and terror.
