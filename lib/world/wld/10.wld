      <roomdescription>The path ends here in a wide clearing, the ground perfectly flat and
packed to a hard, solid surface by centuries sparring students.  The
smooth surface stretches out towards the north and east where the grounds
are sectioned off into smaller practice yards and training rings, and in
the distance to the north stands the sprawling building used by the
Warders.  There are almost always groups of men training here, alone, in
pairs, or as part of larger exercises, and most wield &amp;ywooden&amp;n lathes rather
than bare steel.  Only a few trees are scattered through the training
grounds to offer shade from the &amp;wg&amp;Wl&amp;Ya&amp;wr&amp;Wi&amp;wn&amp;Yg &amp;Ws&amp;Yu&amp;Wn&amp;n, and there are no benches -
spectators must stand, or sit on the few patches of shortly cropped grass
that surround the trees.

    <roombasic title="A Sparring Yard" vnum="1001" zone="10">
      <roomdescription>The sparring yard is a fairly simple affair, with the ground cleared in it&apos;s
center so that the trainees and warders can spar without tripping over
anything.  It is perfect here for practicing the forms, and for teaching or
learning them.  Every now and then a group of students or warders will walk by,
chatting about the niceties of this or that method of attack or defense.  This
is a place of learning.

      <roomdescription>To the north, east and west lie more areas of training.  The ground here is 
cleared for easier movement, so that no one trips while sparring.  Well, at
least they aren&apos;t supposed to.  Some of the less adept students may still
suffer the occasional fall.  A rack full of bundled lathes for practicing and
learning is at the end of the cleared ground.  Some students are here, and an
old warder can be seen every now and then, walking amongst the students, and
offering advice.

    <roombasic title="Another Sparring Yard" vnum="1003" zone="10">
      <roomdescription>This is a slightly more difficult sparring yard to use than most of the others.
The ground here has not been cleared completely of all the natural obstacles that
one might see in a forest, or on a road.  There are some fist-sized stones lying
about, and even a few branches as thick as an arm.  They are here so that the
students can learn to fight in the conditions which they might one day face on the
road, with their Aes Sedai.  There aren&apos;t as many students here as there are at 
the other practice yards, because not many of them enjoy sparring on the rough,
uneven ground.

is a rough thing, and spars are fought to first blood with naked steel, not
bundled lathes.

can be seen in neatly lined stalls, and no awful smells come from that

they didn&apos;t, they would most likely receive some very unpleasant treat-
ment from their customers, the warders.

      <roomdescription>There is a very small sparring yard here, fit for no more
than two people at once.  The ground is very hardpacked,
and very smooth.  Separated from the north end of the yard
by about five feet is an arch.  The arch leads into the
warder facilities, the place where all of the students and
their instructors sleep.  Even some of the warders have 
permanent rooms in there, although such is rare.  Most 
of those bonded to an Aes Sedai live the majority of their
life on their road, short as that life may be.

multiple opponents.  One could even hold a small-scale battle here,
with perhaps ten opponents on each side.  There is even a small hole
on each side of the practice yard for putting in a flag.  These
holes are on the east and west sides of the yard, and are used for
training the Tower Guard recruits various methods of strategy.  To
the west is the entrance to the warder facilities, east and south
are more practice yards.

masters of the Tower practice their martial arts, using naked steel and
anything else they might want.  After two blademasters match steel here,
at least one of them, more commonly both, need the attentions of a skilled
Yellow aes sedai.

the stables very, very clean and organized.  Buckets of fresh, cool

come here to lay flowers in memory of a lost friend, or perhaps it might be
a Sedai, come here to pay respects to a warder who paid the ultimate price to
protect her.  South of here are the practice fields, where students spar and
learn their trade, whether they train for the Tower Guard or a future bond.
North lies the warder facilities, where they sleep and socialize while in the

Laying in the heaped coals are several pieces of burning hot metal. Near
the forge is a large wooden stump with a cold iron anvil resting on it.
Scattered about the room are several large hammers, tongs, and other tools.
Against one of the walls lie several huge wooden barrels, filled with
assorted liquids used for quenching the metals.  Between the entrance and
the forge is a large workbench.  On it are dozens of small tools laying
between several current tooling projects and small bits of gold and silver,
along with an occasional jewel.  Just on the other side of the workbench is
a large wooden rack with several swords, knives, and assorted armor pieces
awaiting repair. There are several shelves lining the walls with assorted
jars, boxes and other containers.  With all of the stuff laying around, the
casual observer might see chaos, but to the owner of this forage,
everything is placed strategically, ready for use.

far off wall, and a series of bookshelves holding various scrolls,
small leatherbound tomes and books that look older than the wood that
supports them.
   On a second glance, you realize that there is a couch just next to
the door you came in the room from, large and comfortable looking, used
as a bed on many occasions. A very low table is placed in front of it,
used to hold a tray of various small bottles containing assorted alcoholic
beverages.
   There is an odd scent in the room, which you may recognise as that
of old, fine quality paper, mixed with the faint traces of wine in the air
to create a rather unusual, although hardly unpleasant atmosphere of warmth
and comfort in the room.

one side is an elaborately carved chair. This chair has two sapphires,

The rest of the chair is a brilliant emerald green. It is well done and

      <roomdescription>It is a simple looking room, sparsely furnished, but definitely functional.
Along one wall is a window, right next to the large four poster bed. The wall
opposite bears pegs for hanging clothing, where the woman living here keeps
her extra gear. There is a small wardrobe in one corner, its door closed,
where she keeps her more formal attire. The other corner, near the door, holds
a large comfortable chair. The room is kept neat, everything in its place.

sweat from the pores, and the stench of sulphur does not make this
place any more comfortable to be in.  An aged blacksmith is here,
appraising his wares for Sarm to sell.  The floor is dirty and 
covered with soot and ashes, and a fire is continually quietly blowing
in the bellows.  An anvil rests in one corner of the room, and on
it are assorted pieces of battle equipment, such as suits of armor
and swords.

are.  Racks of towels line the eastern wall, and
depressions in the ground surrounding the large
pool of water hold bars of soap, slightly scented
with a masculin, earthy fragrance.

occur within and without this chamber.  A desk constructed of fine wood, rests
against the eastern wall, ink wells and rolls of parchment, scattered in
various places, seemingly at random, upon the smooth surface.  A bed, described
more accurately as a cot, has been placed against the southern wall, above
which, a window looks down upon the Tower and the Warder yards below.  Save for
a few chairs and a bookcase holding a few slim volumes, this sanctuary is
relatively empty and unadorned, only newly marked by its owner.

Tucked away behind the table is a medium sized \c03bookcase\c06 that

far wall, is what could best be described as a large \c03o\c14a\c03k\c14e\c03n
desk\c06.  Covering the majority of what is the northern wall is
a large \c13bed\c06.  The \c13bed\c06 is neatly made with fine \c14s\c23i\c14l\c23k\c14s\c06, supple

who obviously did not plan on any particular theme,  pattern,  rhyme, 
or reason. While the room is neat and clean, it is evident that whom-
ever sleeps here designed it to his needs and interests first and 
foremost. The room is hued in such a way with windows that it always
appears to be sunset during the day and pale alabaster inside during 
the night. In the far corner, four hooks fastened into the ceiling hold 
white ropes that lead down to a loose, comfortable white 
hammock, holding only a pillow, a brown teddy bear with a red
bow tie, and a lavender blanket. Along the nearest wall rests a couch
that easily functions as a day bed, decorated in a theme of soft 
yellows, reds, and oranges. Across from the hammock
is a simple oaken desk with papers stacked neatly about it. It is apparent 
that the fellow living here keeps most of his belongings in the closet by 
his couch, prefering to have plenty of room inside to manuver.

unique swords, each blade crafted in one of the many nations of the known
world.  In the center of this chamber, two plush leather upholstered
chairs face the southern wall, sitting before a large, well shined &amp;yoak&amp;n
desk.  Behind the desk upon the back wall, a large canvas map of the known
realm hangs from two silver spikes.  The map is crafted by the needlework
of some of what must have been the most talented seamstresses in the
lands, &amp;Bb&amp;bl&amp;Bu&amp;be&amp;Bs&amp;n and &amp;Gg&amp;gr&amp;Ge&amp;ge&amp;Gn&amp;gs&amp;n blending into a &amp;Yg&amp;yo&amp;Yl&amp;yd&amp;Ye&amp;yn&amp;y brown&amp;n background.  On the

      <roomdescription>Being inside of this room is like standing at the heart of some great
War room. Banners of the White Tower and weapons of all kinds line the 
walls, ranging from pikes to bows to swords and everything in between. 
All of them, from the plainest to the most ornate show extensive signs 
of use. These are no simple show pieces, but tools of death that have 
seen combat and survived to tell their tale in scars and nicks. On the 
far left side of the room rests a round oak table, surrounded by 
several dark stained chairs. On the table rests a higly detailed map of
the land, and several markers, some with a Sunburst, some with a 
Dragon&apos;s Fang, many with the Flame of Tar Valon, and several more with 
obscure symbols. On the far right side of the room is a plain platform,
raised about two feet off of the ground. The surface of the wood shows 
many scratches and scrapes, but nothing else covers it&apos;s surface. It is
a sparring platform for those truly capable to keep the edge of skill.
Last, but far from least, at the back of the room looms a huge oaken
desk, covered with sheafs of notes and reports, ink and quills, and
even a few weapons. Behind the desk rests a very plain, well worn old
oaken chair, while in the front of the desk sit three plush comfortable
chairs for visitors. This is the office of the Captain of the Guard.

Papers and books scattered over its surface indicate that it functions as a desk for the occupant.  A wrought iron bracket over the table holds a large, well-kept oil lamp that sends off a soft glow over the contents of this otherwise rather harsh room.  A wardrobe matching the table stands against the wall to your left, providing a place for clot
ing storage, and a pair of iron hooks next to the door offer a place for a cloak to be kept at the ready.  Against the wall opposite you is a narrow cot with a thin matress and a woolen blanket that serves in place of a quilt.  A pair of iron-bound chests against the wall provide storage, as well as doubling as seats for visitors.  Only one seat - an easy chair upholstered in pure white cloth - looks at all inviting.  Even the chair tucked under the table is plain, unpadded wood.

      <roomdescription>This room is austerely designed, the furniture all of the highest 
quality, but of fairly simple construction. The main piece of furniture
in the room is a large desk of lovingly varnished oak. Behind the desk
is a tall backed chair, upholstered with red silk, stitched with 
dark green thread. The wall behind the chair is unadorned save with 
the banner of the White Tower, the pristine tear-drop gleaming in the
light, and two windows looking out on the practice yard. The wall to
the right of the chair bears a small, private armory, with a suit of 
mail, and an assortment of weapons. Closer to the desk is a very 
comfortable looking chair with green velvet upholstery, and
well-cushioned arms, attached to which are two sticks with leather
straps. Next to the armory is a door, slightly ajar which leads into a
rather small room with a bed. There are no other seats in the room,
although a large iron-bound chest next to the weapons could certainly
be used as such.

The powder blue paint that covers the walls creates a large open atmosphere 
to this otherwise small space. Toys are scattered across the floor in reckless 
abandon, while the obviously child-sized oak bed is neatly made with a 
patchwork quilt of grays and blues. Thick pillows are arranged in something 
of a nest on the bed. A pint sized table and chairs is underneath the window 
and has a tiny porcelain tea set arranged on it. An oak wardrobe with intricate 
scrollwork stands on the wall opposite of the bed and is approximately four 
feet tall, making it very apparent that it was built to suit it&apos;s owner. Upon 
further inspection a few lathes from the training yards have also been dragged
here and hidden beneath the bed.

Fine linen drapes in a deep emerald green are pulled to either side of the window by ivory colored cords. The sunlight that makes its way in reflects off the steel in the weapons hanging from an ornate weapons rack on the eastern wall. An oak writing desk sits beneath the rack with a chair covered in a finished black leather. A four post bed stands against the wall opposite the desk. A thick quilt in patterns of green and ivory cover 
he bed, with two large feather pillows arranged at it&apos;s head. Large iron chests most likely made for clothing sit at either end of the bed. A map of the continent hangs in a gilded frame to the left of the door. Two small stools sit beneath the map with a steel tipped pointing stick resting against one of them.

the hardwood floor, and a huge comfortable chair rests by the fire,
perfect for reading in.  Along the southern wall &amp;wswords&amp;n and &amp;warmaments&amp;n of

cabinet which holds clothing, a large wooden footlocker at the end of the
bed, and a small end table next to the head of the bed.  The room is kept
completely spotless and well maintained.  On the other side of the bed,
there is a small shelf of books.

    <roombasic title="Tower Square" vnum="1099" zone="10">
      <roomdescription>The centre of this city of legend is bustling, bright, and vivacious.
Almost as old as the Age itself, it stretches out in all directions,
flooding the mind with sights and sounds. Every race is
represented among the thronging crowds flowing across the stone
of the square, some warriors, some merchants, and most everyday
citizens. Hawkers adorn the edges, staying out of the way of most
of the traffic, yet still screaming out their wares to be heard above
the din. Sedans weave through the crowd, bearers struggling to
cut a clean path through the multitude. Striking out from the
patterned white and grey stones of the square is a fountain,
Ogier-built like the rest of Tar Valon, a simple yet beautiful,
white teardrop encased in streams of rushing water. The square is
surrounded in the distance by the twisting spires of Tar Valon,
while directly to the northeast, the entrance to the White Tower
itself resides. The huge structure dominates the skyline of Tar
Valon and is simply breathtaking to observe as its height stretches
almost, it seems, to the roof of the world.
