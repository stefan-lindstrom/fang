The gangplank of the Ship "Dancer"~
You stand on the gangplank to a large, bulky ship, and understand what the 
somewhat odd name came from; The wind creates an eerie sound in the 
riggings, almost like some kind of slow, low wail.
To the south is the wide deck, on which several sailors walk about,
apparently doing their business.

The Bow of the Ship 'Dancer'~
The smell of sea salt, bare wood and wet sail meets your nose as you walk
about on the slow going, bulky, fat sloop 'The Fat Lady Sings'.
The vessel is not that well tended and could use a major overhaul, but 
apparently the shipowner has some kind of financial problems.
