      <roomdescription>Deep in the middle of the forest, the trees abruptly begin 
to thin out. The presence of man can be felt even here, at 
the heart of wilderness. A faint smell of burning is carried
to your nostrils, and upon closer examination, you would
find that most of the stumps around you have not been 
cut down, but have burned. To the west, you can enter 
the clearing that is forming, or head back the way you 
came, back into the woods.

      <roomdescription>\c00Nothing but charred stumps remain, all around a dirt path 
that leads on. However, a wooden construction, a watch 
tower of sorts, guards the path. A simple structure, a few
logs tied together, and a platform at the top, protected 
from arrows by a cone-shaped roof of the same material. 
At all times, two or three black-coated men can be seen 
from that perch, just at the height of the neighboring trees, 
but no taller.

      <roomdescription>\c00The path continues, a gentle slope rising to the west. Fields 
full of crops lie on both sides of you, the vegatation taking 
a hit from the brutal heat of today's weather, but is otherwise 
intact. To the west, lies a crossroads of paths, leading to many
different areas of this huge farm, to the east, lies the watch
tower and the dense woods. To the south is a huge gray tent.

    <roombasic title="The Black Tower Square" vnum="13003" zone="130">
      <roomdescription>The rocky area is slightly elevated, an informal plateau. Surrounding 
the plateau on all sides are fields-having been plowed by a farmer 
countless times. The fields are populated, however. Not with 
vegetation, but with tents, wooden structures, and even human 
beings-men, women, and children. At the center of the plateau lies a 
simple podium, of the purest black one could have laid eyes upon. 
Despite the foreboding nature of the podium, the plateau happens to be 
a place of meeting for all inhabitants of this farm. Women chat with 
their men idly, while keeping an eye on their children whom play with 
other children. The rocks and grass make unorthodox, but nevertheless 
serviceable, benches and seats. All in all, it is a somewhat cheery 
setting, while the smell of burnt wood wafts through the air-
apparently ignored by all present.

      <roomdescription>The first room of the manor house is simply huge. The height of 
the room goes up well over two stories to the roof at the very top. 
All around the room lie tables, large wooden ones. At times random 
amounts of women and children pass through, sometimes a tray of 
various types of food and drink in their hands. Archways in both the 
northern and southern walls lead into smaller rooms.

adorn the walls, nothing to detract from the pure harshness of the stone. The
air here is a touch cooler, at least giving some respite from the oppressive
heat. In each corner of the rectangular hallway, a delicate golden stand
supports a thin white taper. The candles burn slowly, providing enough light
to admire the beautiful red carpet that lines the center of the floor.
Following the carpet's path leads to a large oaken door at the northern end

Karaethon Cycle, the Prophesies of the Dragon.  In the southeast corner near his
precious collection stands the \c04High Asha'man's \c00desk, where many \c04Asha'man \c00plots
have be born and died. In the very center of the room lay several ornate chairs
by a wide marble table where the High Asha'man entertains guests.  Atop the table
there is a \c03copper pitcher\c00 of chilled wine to parch the throat and relax the
muscles.  To your north, an arching doorway leads to Seoman's bedroom.

      <roomdescription>Before you is a plain soldiers room with everything
well-made but nothing really extravagant except 
for three silver statues placed precisely on top 
of a small table.  Each statue shows a great deal
of detail the largest of which is of an attractive 
woman cradling an infant in her arms.  Beside 
the woman stand smaller statues of a small boy
and girl that both share some of the woman's features.
A small comftorable looking bed rests in one corner
with a steel worked wardrobe at its base.  Next to the
bed there is a nightstand on top of which rests a small
lantern and a leather bound book.  Along side the other
wall opposite of the bed is a desk cluttered with papers
pertaining to the status of his students.

standing in the far right corner. At its foot sits a locked, wooden chest piled
with neatly folded old clothes and miscellaneous odds and ends. Across from
the bed, in the far-left corner, stands a desk on which sit quills, inkpots and
an open book, half-filled with spidery handwriting, sketches and diagrams.
Next to the desk stands a bookcase filled with books ranging from ancient to
modern. Most of the books have something to do with healing, although books
on history, warfare and even the occasional novel grace the shelves. In the
middle of the room sit two comfortable-looking chairs for the occasional guest
and a few more line the walls in case they are needed.

Fresh cut \c03tree-stumps\c00 and \c02grass\c00 line the sides of the dirt path you are on.

      <roomdescription>\c00The office of Narishma, the assistant of Mazrim Taim, is not as austere and
stern as one may expect here in the Black Tower. Along the walls are small book
shelves, the spines of the books boasting such titles as &quot;A Study of the
Kaerethon Cycle&quot; and &quot;The Herbs of Andor and their uses in Healing&quot;. A large
desk dominates the far western wall of the room, its wood dark and carefully
polished. Small, neat stacks of paper rest on one corner, notes taken on them
in Narishma's concise, compact scrawl. Behind the desk, a large chair rests,
its seat cushioned in a dark red velvet. Behind this chair, a sketch of the
Lord Dragon's battle in the skies over Falme can be seen. Along the southern
wall, small viles of various herbs and concoctions draw one's attention.
Apparently, Narishma studies the more mundane forms of healing, as well as
those methods that use the One Power.

      <roomdescription>As you step off of the last stair your eyes behold a beautiful sight. A deep
crystal blue pool of water is in front of you. It nearly fills the space of
the whole cavern. Light pours down long winding shafts cut out of the rock
overhead. Blue stained glass was placed in the shafts to give this room a
surreal look to it. Diamonds glitter from the walls and add their own
sparkle to the grand illusion of the room. Flows of water fall from a
waterfall at the far end. A large island sits in the middle of the lake,
defying to be removed as the water gently laps at its sandy beach. Subdued
shades of green are seen on the small ring of trees on the island and a
small stone walkway goes from the end of the cavern to the small sandy
beaches of the island.

much of its inhabitants are drawn here.  Men, some in \c04black coats\c00, the
occasional woman, and the uncommon child are spread throughout the square,
some chatting in small groups; more are simply enjoying the break from
their daily labors and training.  A well of \c23stone\c00 lies in the center of

apparent by the three long \c03tables\c00 spread out vertically, to 
the right of the entrance. To the left, is a makeshift bar, 
consisting of a counter wherein numerous \c23d\c06r\c23i\c06n\c23k\c06s\c00 can be 
found. A wife of one of men manages the \c01barn\c00, be her 
servicing the counter, or bringing out \c07c\c06o\c07l\c06d\c00 plates of \c03fo\c03od\c00
from the storeroom. It is commonplace to find three or 
four \c04black-coated\c00 men at the \c03tables\c00, reveling in the escape 
from lessons, over a meat pie. Whether the meals are \c01h\c08o\c01t\c00 
or remain \c07c\c06o\c07l\c06d\c00 depends on the abilities of the man.

      <roomdescription>The central \c03field\c00 behind the back of the \c01farmhouse\c00 is 
comprised almost exclusively of soft-packed dirt, riddled 
with bits and shards of \c03wood\c00 and \c23rock\c00, seemingly 
churned many times over. As far as the eye can see, the 
area is simply bustling with activity, for most of the 
lighted hours of the day. \c04Black-coated men\c00 are present 
everywhere in both large and small groups - be it sitting 
on the \c03g\c02r\c03o\c02u\c03n\c02d\c00, baring witness to the awesome and often 
times \c03d\c01e\c03s\c01t\c03r\c01u\c03c\c01t\c03i\c01v\c03e\c00 wonders of the \c14One Power\c00, or groups of 
as little as two or three, each standing opposite the other. 
In all cases, it is evident that this acreage has been 
reserved as training grounds for both the \c14One Power\c00 and 
the mind. In the center of the field lies a large block of 
\c04polished black rock\c00, almost as tall as an average-sized 
man. There are steps crudely cut into the back of the rock.

the wall opposite the door, simple white sheets
covering the feather mattress.  A dresser and an
armoire stand against one of the long walls of the
rectangular room, sandwitching a desk made of dark
wood.  The only other furnishings are a plush chair
between the bed and dresser, a desk chair before the
desk, and a weaponrack opposite the armoir, against
the other wall.  The rack seems to be made to hold a
rather astonishing number of weapons, considering only
two people seem to live in the room.  A simple carpet
covers most of the floor, dark blue with a gray
pattern which shows its Arafellin origins.

      <roomdescription>The room is quite large. In one corner stands an unmade bed, littered with
papers, parchments, and old books. Above the head of the bed, secured
to the wall, hangs a Shienaran two-handed sword and a large shield with
the sigil of House Shiowa. A large desk resides in the middle of the room,
this also littered with old papers, books, and writing material. A black
coat is carelessly tossed over the back of the chair.

      <roomdescription>   A smallish room, large enough to be an office perhaps, but little more.  It
certainly looks like an office, with a desk in one corner, stacked with neat
rows of papers, and a closed cabinet with a lock right next to the desk.  In
the opposite corner is a bed with the sheets folded and neatly stacked by the
headboard, the ropes supporting the mattress pulled tight.  The mattress on the
bed is soft, filled with feathers, maybe.  A small opening in the wall next to
the bed, about eye-level, contains some shirts and pants stacked neatly beside
one another.  There is a single picture hanging in the room, of a large stone
tower, painted black, with a lightning bolt stabbing down in the middle of it,
which seems to cause the blue radiance painted around the tower.

   The interior of the cabin is quite bare.  Near the entry is a small oak
desk covered with various papers.  Next to the desk is a chest with
dresses peeking from within.  Along the far wall is a bed big enough to
hold two people.  The only window is covered with a small white curtain,
and on the sill is a tiny red plant.  The room is filled with an almost
tangible intensity, threatening to crack the wood.
