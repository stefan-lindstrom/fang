the \c08Dragonsworn\c00.  There are various plants growing here as

food is not ready yet.  It is &amp;Bnot&amp;n a pretty sight.  To the Northeast

who didn't have their meal ready on time.

      <roomdescription>Entering this room, it becomes all too clear that The Prophet has
made a point of leaving the room bare of decoration.  There is
no rug to cover the wooden panelled floor, there are no wall hang-
ings.  In the middle of the room is a large oaken desk with a sturdy
ladder backed chair behind it.  The desktop is bare, and the chair is
without any gilt or padding, making it look slightly uncomfortable in it's
rigidness.  Behind the desk is a large window which overlooks the rear
of the manor, the courtyard below.  Before the desk are two short
chairs, also lacking any fancy decor or padding.  The room itself is
almost foreboding in it's emptiness, a large cube at the center of
which is The Prophet's desk, the window behind it doesn't manage
to provide much comfort against the rest of the starkness.

given with great skill and ease.  Each member has a choice of a 
dagger or a sword, but everyone must have one.  Along the West wall
is a rack full of different swords of different weights and such for
the members to experiment with to find the one to fit he or she just
perfectly.  Along the East wall is another rack, yet this one is full
of different daggers. each one is slightly different in it's shape 
and weight to give the members examples of ones that might work best
for he or she.

      <roomdescription>Entering the hall of the barracks reveals several other halls. 
Because the \c08Lord Dragon's Army \c00is so large, many sleeping quarters
are needed.  This hall is plain, simple, yet well-lit.  To the West
is the West wind of barracks.  To the North is the North wing of 
barracks. To the Northwest is the Northwest wing of barracks.  A
sudden noise becomes apparent.  What is it?  Why it's the soldiers
SNORING!!!  Going to the Southwest is a very long hallway which will eventually
lead to another set of barracks.

splits the narrow path in two is to be found here.  The garden is filled
with many beautiful &amp;W&amp;Wwhite&amp;n&amp;n roses, so many in fact, one could easily
be tempted to pick some.  To the right the path continues westward,
but to the left, the path takes a more attractive route, dotted with
even more wonderous &amp;Wwhite&amp;n roses.  This path meanders around in
a horseshoe about the actual garden before reuniting with the
westward path.

are scattered across the hardwood floor, \c01red\c00 and \c03gold\c00 with intricate 
scrollwork lining the fringed edges.

shines through the single window that lies on the east wall.  A
simple bed is pushed into the far northwest corner, \c11dark blue\c00
coverlet lies over top with a couple plump pillows.  An \c03oak\c00 table
rests beside it covered with a dusty leather bound book, several
leaflets of paper peeking through the top.  A little cubby hole in
the bottom of the table holds a \c07white\c00 porcelain bowl and matching
pitcher, chipped with age.  Several chalk drawings are scattered
along with walls, potraits of nameless people in various settings.  
Over top of the bed, mounted on the wall lies a saber, it's slightly
curved \c23b\c07l\c23a\c07d\c23e\c00 gleaming in the \c03l\c07i\c03g\c07h\c03t\c00 from the window.  A rectangular,
steelbound wood trunk lies at the foot of the bed, a heavy lock
attached to the front.

      <roomdescription>The scent of roses still lingers here, though the path becomes dusty
and a quick glance reveals that there has been horses either ridden
or lead through this way by the tracks evident.  Sadly, walking even
further, it becomes noticeable that there is a new aroma in the air, one
in stark contrast to that of the pleasant roses just passed by.  As
the trail is followed onward in the westward direction, back around to the
rear of the mansion itself, it's obvious that yes, the stables are close
by, the scent in the air becoming very distinct indeed.

      <roomdescription>The path widens a bit here, ending at the equally wide front doors
of the stable.  The stable itself a small building and in need of some
various repairs by the looks of it, though it serves it's purpose well
enough.  The stable doors, once a bright sheen of red, now a dull
brown, and worn with age and neglect.  Wooden planks decorate
these doors randomly, as though nailed up to patch it in a sense.
Above the wide doors, the roof comes to a triangular peak.  The
thatching appearing very frayed along the edges, the only other
noticeable aspect of this small building is the upper floor opening
which is a mere two paces above the frontdoor frame.  This
opening looks wide enough to fit two men standing abreast of
each other, an average person standing upright easily within as
well.  Thrust out from above this upper floor opening there is a
short wooden boom, attached to the front of the stable with an
iron truss.  From the end of this boom dangles a length of rope
tied in a noose.

      <roomdescription>Entering the stables it becomes clear that not many horses are
frequently housed or cared for here, although there must be
one or two usual employers of this structure, the acrid smell
betrays that at least.  The floor is covered in scattered hay and
there's not a broom in sight it seems.  Tacks worn with age and
wear occupy rungs on the walls just inside the entrance.  There
are four stalls to each side of the building, the center aisle
between the stalls remarkably clear save for the hay.  A couple
of the dividing walls have saddles thrown over them and a glance
upward will reveal the large retangular opening in the upper
floor which looks down upon the stalls.

      <roomdescription>Edging past the first stall and under the hayloft, a look to the left
shows that the first stall there is being used to store miscellanious
farming and blacksmithing tools, propped up against the stall walls.
There's a handful of pitchforks, branding irons, blacksmith hammers
and spare shoes piled on the floor in addition to the other items.
Still no broom, a rake or two, a shovel, but no broom.  To the right
the stall is bare beyond a small pile of hay and what looks to be a 
discarded riding cloak.  The next stall on the right seems in much
better order, as if this stall is actually used by someone from time to
time.  The stall is swept out, clear of hay, there's a couple bags of oats
on the floor in there and a feedbag hanging from an iron hook on
the stall post.  A spare saddle is thrown over the far dividing wall along
with a checkered horse blanket.  The stall across from this one on the
left seems to be another one used for extra storage, more various
farming tools and utilities, as well as some more bags of oats, stacked
to one side.  Looking up, one can see the sunlight slide down into the
stables from the hayloft window, dust motes swirl through the sunbeams
and hay particles often fall indiscriminately from above, sliding through
cracks in the wooden pannelled floor.

painting is of a beatiful woman with long, suncolored hair and wearing a low-cut,
green gown.  Nestled between her breasts is a large ruby hung from a golden
chain.  A fair sized desk has been placed just under the painting and several papers
have been organized into jumbled piles upon it.

Along the north wall is a king size bed, complete with ruffled and thick
beddings and no less than four plump, scattered pillows.  To the
left of the bed, as you enter, is a servicable wash stand and to the
right of the bed, is an oaken nightstand.  Upon the nightstand sits
a stack of books, looking well read by their bindings and a small steel
reading lantern.  The nightstand itself is filled with books as well, it's
two small shelves jammed with over a dozen literary works.  On the
floor is a beautiful Tairen work, depicting a scene of a forgotten battle
with splashes of color and dramatic illustrations of a man on standing
against a horde of trollocs, laying waste to them in short order, so
the artist and craftsman would wish you to deduce at any rate.  The
edges of the rug are woven with intricate scrollwork gilted in silver and
furthermore, braided tassles spill out to complete the covering of the
wood panelled floor.  In the corner of the room, where the north
wall and the west wall meet, is a large iron bound chest, upon
which even more books are stacked.  The walls themselves are
bare yet this does nothing to affect the overall comfortable feel
to the room.

if it's occupant sees no time for cleaning up.  A simple, but well
made bedstand lies in the corner next to the bed, with a single
washbasin.  Various books are scattered about the room in
apparent disorder, left on the wood panelled floor carelessly.
Against the west wall is a modest wardrobe, the doors of which
hang open, revealing it to be empty of any clothes.  A small
bronze lantern on the floor at the foot of the bed seems to be
the only choice as a source of light, no other candles or lanterns
throughout.

fine piece of Tairen craftsmenship.  The rug, depicting a scene
of peaceful wilderness with splashes of bright and exaggerated
coloring, is edged with intricate scrollwork gilted in gold.  The

there is an air to it, as if it hasn't seen an occupant for a

rather weathered looking blanket in the back of the stall, the floor
kept clean here as well.  Across the middle aisle, the stall to the
left is bare besides more scattered hay and dung, a bundled
length of rope laying among the filth there.

      <roomdescription>The last two stalls of the stables don't resemble stalls in the slightest.
Perhaps this is where the traffic coming to and from this old building
originates?  For the last two stalls have been converted, altered into
a small gathering area.  In the middle aisle, against the rear wall of the
building, there is a small round table.  Around the table there is a semi-
circle of chairs, stools and even transplanted treestumps.  The stall to the
left seems to serve as a refuse depository, piled with trash and garbage
from many meals and many drinks.  Flies gather here exclusively it
seems, it's a wonder the horses don't go mad from their incessant
buzzing.  The right rear stall however, houses a handful of wooden
casks, kegs to be exact, and here the scent of apple brandy and
stale ale can be caught.  The blanket which was supposed to hide these
booze caches wasn't very carefully placed it seems, beyond that, the
table is in plain view once a person gets to a certain point in the
stables.  The people responsible for this makeshift clubhouse are
either extremely stupid or apathetic as to who discovers this little
niche.

sparsely put together.  On the far wall, on the left side of the modest
bed, is a sword rack, normally containing a longsword, a quarterstaff,
and a broadsword.  Next to the sword rack are a few hooks, upon
which normally hang small bows, and occasionally a crossbow.  The
bed is normally made, with a thin brown sheet providing the covering
for a white bed covering.  A small pillow lies in the center of the top of
the bed, and the closet merely consists of a few jerkins hanging from
hooks by the side of the bed.  A small tapestry is in the far back of the
room, just above the bed, it appears to be the emblem of the Lord
Dragon Reborn.  It is hard to tell, however, since the light from the two
lanterns, hanging nearby, wash the colors somewhat.  All in all, the room
is serene, and quite sparse.  Certainly without a woman's touch.

lets it leave his side, even when he goes to sleep.  At the entrance of the 
room lies a matted group of small branches and twigs.  (Replaced
periodically, so as to make a crackling noise were you to enter the
room and step upon the matting.)  A lantern lies upon his desk, and one
lies on a table next to his bed.  A small cupboard of sorts lies off in the
near corner, looking to hold a few shirts amongst other articles.  A rifling
through the cupboard would turn up quite a few miscelaneous articles,
each looking as if they belonged to a certain type of man, here, a well-cut
almost noble looking shirt, and there a set of baggy, worn down breeches
of a traveler.  The inside of the room is wallpapered, if you will, with a
series of long, thick sticks that run from ceiling to ground, baring scars
and slices from top to bottom.

      <roomdescription>The most striking aspect of this room is the extreme &amp;Kgl&amp;koo&amp;Km&amp;n that cloaks it.
There are &amp;cwindows&amp;n on the &amp;geast&amp;n and &amp;gwest&amp;n walls, yet they are covered with
thick &amp;Kblack&amp;n curtains.  In the &amp;gnorthwest&amp;n corner of the room sits a small
bed with a &amp;ywooden&amp;n headboard which is filled with &amp;cbooks&amp;n; the top is covered
in wax from the use of candles which sit in unpolished &amp;Ybrass&amp;n candlesticks.
In almost the &amp;gcenter&amp;n of the room sits a large &amp;yoaken&amp;n desk and a very
comfortable looking padded chair behind it.  Next to the chair is a simple
&amp;ywooden&amp;n stool.  Atop the desk is an &amp;yo&amp;Yi&amp;yl &amp;Yl&amp;ya&amp;Ym&amp;yp&amp;n now casting only a dim &amp;yg&amp;Yl&amp;yo&amp;Yw&amp;n.
The desk is covered with scattered &amp;wpapers&amp;n, amongst which can be seen
many pencils and a small &amp;Wk&amp;wnife&amp;n to &amp;msharpen&amp;n them with, with &amp;klead&amp;n and pencil
shavings abundant.  On the floor next to the desk are many crumpled up
&amp;wpapers&amp;n clearly discarded here.  Most appear to be drawings in progess; the
walls of the room are &amp;wpapered&amp;n with dozens of completed works, most being
of &amp;gfierce&amp;n looking &amp;Rdragons&amp;n, some breathing &amp;rf&amp;Ri&amp;rr&amp;Re&amp;n, others in &amp;cflight&amp;n, and
still others laying waste to towns and strongholds.  Barely noticeable in
the dim &amp;yg&amp;Yl&amp;yo&amp;Yw&amp;n of the lamp, on the wall directly behind the desk at about
eye level, is a poster sized drawing of a &amp;glarge&amp;n &amp;Rred dragon&amp;n seemingly
swooping out at the viewer from the &amp;wpaper&amp;n, it's large &amp;Yf&amp;yangs&amp;n &amp;Wg&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;wg&amp;n in

      <roomdescription>This room is quite bare, in fact the only thing of real notice is
the small cot-like bed off to the left side in the rear of the room
and next to that a small, iron bound chest which seems to have
collected more dust than anything else.  On the floor is an old
rug which covers the space almost entirely.  The rug itself is
faded with age and wear, once perhaps a fine Tairen item, it
now looks like a murky mesch of color and dust.  Next to the
doorway, on the right near the doorjam, is a brass candle holder
holding a barely used stick of wax.  There is also another candle
off to the rear on the northwest wall at about head level, in
between the chest and the bed in the corner.  There are no
windows, so with the candles out, the room is a maze of
shadows and murk, clouded with dust and cobwebs.

      <roomdescription>This humble abode has naught for furnishings but a cot, a few chairs,
and a table to eat upon. The kitchen is in the same room, having few
cupboards, all made of pine wood. There is but one window, and even the
glass of the window seems to have been cheaply bought, as the window
distorts outside images. There is a set of shutters beside the window, and
hung upon the opposite wall is a fine tapestry of the Dragon Reborn,
standing triumphantly upon the field of battle, an army at his back
and Shayol Ghul before him. On the wall above the cot is a piece of
yellowed parchment, framed in wood. Upon closer inspection, the
parchment appears to be a hand written copy of the Oaths of the
Dragonsworn. A Two Rivers Longbow leans against one corner, near a full
quiver of arrows. Upon the wall above the bow is a plain, black hilted
longsword.

      <roomdescription>&amp;rA small room, sparcely decorated and kept clean, it has a barren feel to
it which relays the &amp;ccold&amp;r feeling of business.  As you enter through the
room's sole solid &amp;yoak&amp;r door you notice the dominating &amp;yoaken&amp;r desk which
rests in the center of the room facing the doorway.  Directly before the
desk is a scarcely padded chair which has been &amp;Wbolted&amp;r to the floor to
prevent any moving.  The chair on the other side of the desk is only
slightly more padded but is free moving allowing it's user to place it
however is desired.  The &amp;wstone&amp;r walls are bare save a large oil painting of
the &amp;YS&amp;yu&amp;Yn&amp;r breaking over the &amp;cp&amp;Cea&amp;cks&amp;r of a nothern part of the &amp;RD&amp;rragonwall.  One
the left side of the room is a small &amp;ywooden&amp;r dresser and a &amp;wiron&amp;r-bound
chest, both push flush with the wall and sporting well-crafted &amp;wlocks&amp;r.  
The only other furniture occupying the room is a small cot in the far
corner of the right side of the room.  The small window of the room is
high in the wall to the right over the bed.  A set of &amp;wsteel&amp;r bars run from
the top sill to the bottom sill discouraging any with thoughts of entrance
by that means.  &amp;n

rest of the room actually.

Apparently the room's intended purpose would be that of a

and the dust, there's only a small brass candle holder bolted to
the wall to the left of the doorway.

      <roomdescription>You enter a large open chamber, its vaulted ceiling rising up on 
columns of exquisite green viened marble. The floor seems to be one
large \c12m\c05o\c12s\c05a\c12i\c05c\c00 of tiny tiles, depicting a glorious scene of men and
women, drapped in the colors of the Lord Dragon, marching into battle.
Along the walls are arranged simple yet well-polished wooden benches,
a pristine &amp;wwhite towl&amp;n carefully folded and placed precisely atop each.
The &amp;Cd&amp;We&amp;Ce&amp;Wp &amp;Cp&amp;Wo&amp;Co&amp;Wl&amp;n that dominates the room center, produces a thick steam
that rises up to the rooms peak high above. Through this mist the 
&amp;yg&amp;Yi&amp;yl&amp;Yd&amp;ye&amp;Yd &amp;yo&amp;Yi&amp;yl &amp;ylamps&amp;n give the room an almost majestic splendor.

for this purpose as well.  The walls are bare save for two brass
