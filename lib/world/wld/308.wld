      <roomdescription>You enter a large room with panelled walls of dark wood and two lit
hearths. One maid sweeps an already clean floor, the other polishes
the sconces. Several round tables covered with tablecloths 
seat clean and sober men, wary of any stranger that might walk in.
The common room is not one of the more elegant in Caemlyn, but it has
an aura of comfort. To the north lies the kitchen, upstairs are the
rooms and to the east is a hallway.

out unnoticed, for there are often spies watching the inn's front
door. Yes, it is those two men leaning on the barrels, and no, don't

To the north is some murky corner and to the east is a man leaning on
his spear, scratching the ears of a cat.

Shadow. Character being the perfect word to use with him, for clearly
this man is acting. His beady-eyed squints and constant cloak
flourishing do more to make you laugh than inspire fear. His nose
twitching does little to frighten you either. And his name? What
mother under the Light would ever name her child Shadow? But his
wares aren't half bad. Hopefully though, they aren't stolen....

could very well be Lamgwin's twin though. Both have a stocky build,
a lazy heavy-lidded look concealing eyes that see all, and a cat-like
grace and speed that suprises most. Dandin smiles as he scratches the
ears of the brindle cat who replies with a loud purrrr. The two -men-
across the street peer intently at Dandin, who replies by bringing
out a stone and sharpening his spear.

      <roomdescription>The source of the roasting beef and baking bread smells appears to be
this room. And what a source it is! Four iron stoves, two hearths and
one roasting spit are all ablaze. Scullions scrub the greasy pots and
pans furiously, occasionally bandying words with the numerous errand
boys scuttling about. The undercooks stir, season, taste and garnish
the many dishes. But above them all stands Cook. Her hair pulled back 
in a bun, an apron tied around her large bulk, it is clear who is 
mistress here. One minute rapping the knuckles of a scullion, the
next stirring the stew, her wooden spoon flies around the room.
Alas, she's grumbling about the drains again.

      <roomdescription>The cobblestoned path starts from the back door of the kitchen, winding its 
way to the stableyard. A high stone wall maintains the privacy of the inn's 
customers, but the sounds of New City can be heard still, merchants hawking 
their wares on the top of their lungs and various gleemen standing at 
corners, telling their tales. To the north wafts smells of manure and 
straw, and to the south, you sniff roast beef and try not to drool all over 
yourself.

      <roomdescription>The cool stone yard has a peaceful languid air about it, the grooms walking
to and fro the various stables, currying, feeding and watering the horses
according to the customers' directions. At the moment, the head groom Tel
is feeding a glossy black stallion a carrot, and the horse is nickering
happily. The lower grooms scurry about, knowing if they don't, Tel will
probably box their ears. Smart little chaps, aren't they?

      <roomdescription>You enter a warm straw-filled stable that smells strongly of horse. None of 
this suprises you since that's the way a stable should smell, but you 
wrinkle your nose anyway. At the moment, this stable is empty, for hard 
times have made horses an expensive commodity, and the denizens of the 
Queen's Blessing have always had to keep an eye on their purses, so the 
stables are often empty nowadays. You can see Tel from the stableyard, 
shaking his head at the empty stable, sighing.

      <roomdescription>Yet another empty stall, but it seems this stall has just been vacated, 
for in the corner is a nice little surprise for the stableboy.  You snicker
at the bundle of noxious smelling waste, and wonder at what fun it must be 
to clean up after horses.  Tel stands off to the side, a twinkle in his eye 
as he calls for the Hal to come and clean up the surprise. Ahh, the life of 
a stableboy, so carefree and perfume-filled, is it not?

      <roomdescription>This stall is sweet and clean, no surprises, fresh straw covering its 
inside, with a placid roan mare munching on a new batch of oats put out 
for her by Olin, the other stableboy. She seems content with the stall, 
her tack hung neatly on the wall, a full bag of oats before her, with a 
trough filled with water not too far by.  Lazily swatting flies with her 
tail, she nickers at the sight of Olin's hand handing her some apples.
Aren't the stableboys nice?

reason. Call it human nature, because nothing really distingushes this 
stable from the others. Well, all right, the stallion might have something 
to do with it. A big yet graceful looking stallion with a glossy black 
coat and white star on his forehead  stands in the stall, munching oats 
and looking for Tel's carrots and apples. The horse is a pretty animal, a 
tad spoiled, as you notice how he bosses around the stableboys almost as 
much as Tel himself does.

through here very often. The walls are of dark panelled wood, the floor 
is covered with thick dark blue carpet. The walls are adorned with the 
gleaming brass scones that can be found all throughout the inn. All along 
the hall are private dining rooms and sitting rooms for the customer with
the need for privacy and extra coin, of course.

doors on both sides conaining private rooms for the customers' comfort.
The carpet's blue length stretches as fas as the eye can see, the
candlesticks on the wall sputtering slightly as a maid rushes by with
towels loaded in her arms. The walls are made of dark wood, and give the
hallway a soothing, almost womb-like sense of security. The noise from the
common room, low to begin with, is now a low murmur. The hallway curves
again, and you wonder when will it end.

through this part of the hall, for the carpet seems to be a brighter blue 
than the bits closer to the common room. There however is no dust coating 
the shiny oaken floors, nor is there any covering the candlesticks that 
gleam just as brightly here as they do in the other parts of the inn. Two 
doors stand on either side of you, the on one the right seeming to have a 
comforting almost contemplative air about it, even though it is just a door.
The doorknob seems worn, despite the still bright carpet. Perhaps you ought 
to step in then?

      <roomdescription>A quiet unassuming room, the table is made with walnut cut in simple lines, 
but it has been polished many times to a glowing sheen, and is covered with 
a white cotton tablecloth printed with small cheery red flowers. The same 
material covers the cushions decorating the chairs. A small blue vase sits 
in the center of the table, filled with white morningstars. One wall is 
lined with a set of walnut shelves. In them, Master Gil stores some 
precious pieces of pottery or dishes he has managed to snag from a trader. 
Their delicacy seems at odds with the cosy simplicity of the room, but no 
one seems to mind.

      <roomdescription>As you enter the dining room, there is this air of elegance, almost dignity 
about it. Again, the lines of the furniture in the room are very simple, 
but the table and chairs are made of glossy cherry wood that looks delicious
enough to eat.  The table is covered with a filmy sheet of creamy lace that 
is sturdy enough to serve as a tablecloth, yet delicate enough to take your 
breath away. A vase made of thin green Seafolk porcelain stands in the 
middle of the table, holding the finest rose to be found in all of Caemlyn.
The walls are covered with gorgeous paintings of Caemlyn, New City, Inner 
City and the palace. Despite its beauty, however, there is something stiff 
about the room. Perhaps a cat should be brought in here? Nothing like a 
purring cat to add a touch of hominess.

      <roomdescription>This room is slightly different from the rest of the inn because nothing 
in this room is dark. The inn is made of mostly walnut and oak, somber 
colors suiting its law abiding denizens. But in this case, it seems Master 
Gill has opted for this pale, silky golden wood that seems to capture the 
sunlight. The couches and chairs scattered about the room are also made of 
this pale gold wood and are covered with either pale green or pale blue 
linen that seem to recall spring and sweet breezes. Little tables also 
stand next to these chairs, offering a place for a cup of wine or a book. 
Some of the tables have white vases filled with jumpups or Emond's Glories.
All in all, the light seems to make you feel happy in bright, thus making 
it a perfect room to meet and chat in.

shelves. One wall is just shelves, from the floor to its 10 foot ceiling. 
There must be 300, no at least 400 books here. There are clothbound books, 
books with wooden covers and even leatherbound books with gilt edges. You 
take a closer peek and notice that there is a gorgeous copy of The Travels 
of Jain Farstrider, a copy of The Essays of William of Manches and many 
other books that you will probably not have time to even glance at. There 
is a long couch on one end of the room, and several stuffed chairs spaced 
throughout the room. There is a cozy little hearth, with a little black cat 
purring contentedly. The carpet seems a bit faded and old, as are the 
chairs, and you highly doubt that people who would appreciate the books 
frequent this inn, but the library is a interesting place nonetheless.

walls, so there are many shadows, allowing a person to creep up on someone
without warning. The oak railing twists and turns in a graceful almost
sinuous way, along the walls as the stairs progress. It is polished
almost constantly by the maids, and the faint lemon scent is an
invigorating alternative to the old ale you customarily smell in most
inns. Up these stairs are the finest rooms in the inn.

most of the food, well at least the food that she doesn't plan on using in
the next day or so. The cellar has been specially designed to keep cool
regardless of what time of the year it is. The walls are made of smooth
river stones that are famous for their cooling properties. Here the wine and
other brandies and liquors are kept. In the other rooms are potatoes, flour,
and any other goods Cook cannot seem to live without.

making you want to take off your shoes and wriggle your toes in it. The 
walls are the usual well polished walnut panelling. The scones on the wall 
are a bit more ornate, with curlicues, leaves and flowers. Even the 
doorknobs are polished well enough to see your reflection in. Most of the 
rooms here require special keys that must be purchased below, for an extra

a key now?

      <roomdescription>As you walk down the hallway, you notice the little flowers on the carpet
that were hidden in the shadows before. They are red, blue, green and gold,
subtle and yet elegant at the same time. You trace a line of flowers with
your toe, watching the line curl and twist its way along the length of
the carpet. More gleaming door knobs glisten in the glow of the dim lamps.
A small side table holds a crystal vase bearing roses of Andor. You sniff
their fragrance happily as you whistle a little tune and continue your
way down the hall.

      <roomdescription>You seem to have reached the end of the hallway. Here, the doors seem
even more extravagant, with engraved roses and vines twining all along
the length of the doors and scented candles burning in the scones, the
sweet scent of roses wafting through this part of the hallway. There are 
even pictures of Caemlyn hung upon the walls, the gleaming white and 
gold spires and towers, the tiles red and purple all catch and delight 
your eye. The stairs to the next floor of rooms lies to the north. Rooms 
lie to the east and west, and you may turn back south to the rest of the 
hallway and second floor rooms.

A simple bed made with clean \c06sheets\c00 tucked tightly around
the corners has a neat look to it. A tiny nightstand sits to the right of
bed, just big enough for a book or a cup of wine perhaps. A small
wooden padded chair sits off in one corner, and a thin grey washbasin
with its chipped side facing the wall sits on top of the washstand in
another corner.

head to rest upon them.  Perhaps it is the darling figurines of little
animals standing in niches in the wall of the room, or the fetching white
basin painted with &amp;mpink roses&amp;n.  The crowning touch of the room is the
&amp;Whearth&amp;n and the &amp;brocking &amp;cchair &amp;nwith a &amp;bc&amp;mu&amp;ns&amp;ch&amp;bi&amp;mo&amp;nn to match the quilt.  There is

quilt, a cushioned chair, this one made of walnut, standing near the bed,
a nightstand, a washstand with a basin and pitcher, a peg to hang your
belongings on, etc. But it seems that the innkeeper tries to add his own
flair or touch, with a certain twist to the tucking of the corner of the
sheets to a slightly wilted but still healthy flower peeking from a vase
somewhere to a picture of Caemlyn hanging upon the wall.

There is even a little window that lets you look upon the bustling

business, bustling about. The rest of the room is quite nice, a walnut
cushioned chair, a washbasin painted with starblazes, a little table for
tea and even a small closet off to the side.

      <roomdescription>Easily the finest room in the whole inn, this bedroom combines
comfort and luxury. The bed is huge, with a wispy canopy that merely
screens the bed from the rest of the room, versus hiding it. A pale blue
\c06quilt\c00 covers the bed, waiting for someone to snuggle in.
An elegant cherry armoire sits on the other end of the wall, with 
cunning brass handles and hinges, while a matching set of cherry
shelves holding various figurines and a few books stands at the
other end. A trunk at the foot of the bed offers not only extra storage
space, but also seating, with the fluffy blue cushion atop it.

      <roomdescription>As you enter this room, you gasp and blink. It seems as if someone
put this room in the wrong inn. It is not to say that the other rooms are
not so large and impressive as this one is with its well polished teak
and mahogany furniture, but there is an air of stiffness and formality
that contratdicts the homey style Master Gil has cultivated here at the
Queen's Blessing. The lines of the furniture are rather stocky, versus
the cleaner, leaner line seen elsewhere, and the blanket on the bed
looks more as if it were for show than warmth or comfort. The chairs
even seem to lack cushions. Some people prefer this, but they tend to
be outsiders, versus the regulars.

to the set of private rooms on the other side on the inn. This
hallway therefore must exist to insure the privacy of the
customer tenfold, for you could pass through these rooms from the
stables and no one know you had even been here, except for perhaps
the maids. You continue to shuffle your way down the faded blue path,
guided only by the dim light of the candles along the wall.

from the walls that are an unadorned dark walnut panneling.
The carpet is dark blue and somewhat plush, despite its obvious
trodden marks. Maids can be seen coming in and out of the rooms,
bearing trays and towels and other things travellers request.

She blushes and gives you a quick bob as she runs out of the
hallway, flying down the stairs.

the hallway, and at one sconce, a maid is changing one of the more
melted candles. You peer up the dark stairs, wondering what is up in
the attic. Perhaps treasure? Or just rats.

      <roomdescription>The walls of this room are a pale purple, giving it a
comforting air. The furniture of this room is a sturdy
walnut, adding to the sense of comfort pervading the
room. The quilt covering the bed is white, with 
bunches of lilac scattered all over it. The washstand
on the wall opposite the bed has a basin made of grey
river stone upon it. The chair with a lilac-colored
cushion stands next to the window, a small grey vase
holding a bunch of lilac allows the sweet fragrance to
float about the room.

      <roomdescription>The walls are a cheery bright yellow that brings a goofy
grin to your face. Something about this sunny walls the
color of butter makes you happy, yet you can't quite
put your finger on the reason for it. The curtains are
a simple sheet-like white. The bed on the opposite wall
from the window is covered with a comforter of a checkered
buttery yellow and white, covered with sunny yellow sheets
and white pillow. The washstand is white-washed and the
basin is a white-flecked blue. On the windowsill is a 
vase, a white-flecked blue to match the basin, holding
a bunch of cheery buttercups that manages to make the
walls look sad.

      <roomdescription>This room is a fetching chamber, suitable for a young girl.
The walls are a pale pink. The frilly white curtains
flutter lightly against the windowsill. Opposite from the
window is the bed. The bed is covered with a soft white
comforter printed with dainty pink rosebuds and piled upon
it are many pink and white pillows. Next to the bed is a
small oak nightstand, with a small glass vase holding a 
single rosebud.

      <roomdescription>The walls are painted a sweet melancholy room, reminding you
sadly that at some point you must leave this room to go off
and continue your journey elsewhere. The furniture is a somber
ebony, cut in simple lines. The bed is in the far corner,
covered with a white comforter embroidered with blue
forget-me-nots. The washstand to the side has a grey basin
upon it and a grey vase of forget-me-nots that seem to say
to you, ' Don't forget me.' One of its petals fall as if to
say good-bye.

vibrant red of a poppy for fear of the scandal and outrage it
would cause with the locals. Instead, there are many accents
of that lovely poppy-red found all throughout the room. The
bedspread is white with poppies printed upon it. The pillow
and sheets are both red and white. The basin is grey, standing
upon the whitewashed washstand and a vase filled with many
many glorious poppies stands next to it.

      <roomdescription>These stairs lead to the attic. The oak railing still gleams nicely
in the light, and the walnut panneling is still without a mar, but
every now and then, you notice some specks of dust coating the
hard to reach corners, and at times it almost looks like there is a
cobweb, but you realize it is just the shadows playing games with
your mind. There would never be cobwebs in the Queen's Blessing.
Although, these stairs seem to creak slightly whenever you step on
them, everything seems completely intact.

      <roomdescription>You have reached the top floor of the house. The rooms up here
are tiny and not nearly as nice as the other ones. Some rooms are
even used for storage of odds and ends. There are only four rooms
leading to the main room that leads right off from the staircase.
The floor up here is a bare polished walnut, and there is only one
lonely sconce here, the candle within it is unscented, leaving a
more mundane scent of melted wax hanging in the air.

Sometimes, Master Gil let friends or poor lads with a
good look about them stay in here for free. A dormer
window peeks outside from the slanting outer wall,
and the only furniture in here are the two beds on
either side of the window. Pegs beside the door
are a place to hang belongings.

wall and dormer window and two narrow beds and pegs by the
door. However, it has a slightly more lived-in air to it.
Bright flowered curtains adorn the window and there is a
footstool by one of the beds. The smell of melted wax hints
that at some point, someone was in here reading or such.
And a coat hangs from one of those pegs.

inn has needed or may need at some point, but is not
of use now. The many boxes filling this huge room are
covered in dust, stacked neatly in some places and 
haphazardly in others. You wonder what may be in the
boxes, but they seem to be tightly bound. The only way
to see what is in them would mean disturbing the cobwebs,
and those spiders look awfully mean to you.

that all the items up here are mundane stuff, towels,
silverware, etc. Nothing exciting.

      <roomdescription>This part of the cellar seems to be filled with potatoes, potatoes and well,
more potatoes. They lie in huge piles all throughout the room, waiting to be
fried, boiled, baked, sauteed or whatever else it is they do to potatoes. 
Their earthy smell permeates every corner, and you take in a deep whiff of it.
The room is dark and cool, as all cellars and well potato storage rooms should
be, since something about heat and light are bad for potatoes. No one really
knows why, but as long as the potatoes are edible, no one minds.

walls are filled with cartons of fruits and vegetables that cannot be stored in
the pantry because of all the hear in the pantry and kitchen. The dark is a bit
unsettling at first, but as you squint and peer, your eyes get accustomed to
the gloomy darkness only alleviated by the dim little lantern to the side.
Rumor has it that here is some sort of secret door down here, but no one
has yet to find it. You wonder where the door is, and what it may have.

oddly warm air about.  Seeing as how this is a cellar, the warm air seems
odd.  It's not really that warm, just not as cool as the wine room and
potato room were.  Another odd thing that can be seen is the doors on the
walls.  There seems to be a dozen doors, complete with door knobs, but
none of them open.

although nothing seems to be rotting or stale in any manner. There is
obviously no light in the room, yet you seem to be able to see
everything, including the chest of pale gold wood sitting in the center of
the room. You wonder what exactly is inside the chest, and if it was
worth all that effort you put into looking for the silly thing. Well, if not.
at least you have access to a most interesting room.

comparison to the rest of the inn. Maids can still be seen, walking

various things maids are sent to carry. The carpet is a faded blue,
the sconces flickering slightly as the maids walk by, nodding and
smiling as they pass you.
