      <roomdescription>The door of this room opens up into a wide chamber, the air thick with 
moisture.  Steam rises up slowly from a square shaped pool of \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 that
rests in the middle of the floor.  Several uniformed servants walk in and 
out of this room, all careful to avert their eyes and they quickly shut the 
door in order to keep in the warmth.  \c03Wooden\c00 benches line the walls of 
this room, all padded with a soft \c05mauve\c00 cushion upon the top.  Hooks 
are placed upon the walls above the benches, several bathrobes hanging
down loosely.  A soft hint of a \c06f\c05l\c07or\c05a\c06l\c00 aroma hangs in the air, one edge of 
the pool lined with several vials, all different sizes and colors.  Behind 
the oils and soaps are \c07white\c00 fluffy towels, each embroidered with the 
seal of the \c03R\c10i\c03s\c10i\c03n\c10g \c03S\c10u\c03n\c00.

      <roomdescription>\c00The door, encrusted with a rising \c03golden\c00 sun, opens up into another
sitting room.  This one appears to be less formal then the one across the
hall, done mostly in different shades of \c04b\c06l\c04u\c06e\c00.  Its cool stone floor is
almost completely covered by an intricately embroidered rug, done in
vibrant sky \c06blue\c00 with \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 scroll work along each side.  Darker \c04blue\c00
tassles fan out to cover the unadorned edges of the room, tiny strings of
\c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 mixed within.  Two chairs and a couch make a little sitting area in
the middle of the rug, the chairs sitting opposite of the couch with a
long rectangular table resting in between.  The couch is made of a soft
\c06blue\c00 fabric with darker \c04blue\c00 stripes running vertical along it's length,
tiny tassled pillows resting on each end matching the color and design.  
Each chair is of a different color but both solid in design, the left
being a dark \c04blue\c00 to match the rug and the right done in the same sky \c06blue\c00
as the couch.  A little pillow has been placed in each of them, a dark
\c04blue\c00 pillow resting on the light \c06blue\c00 chair; the light \c06blue\c00 pillow on the
dark \c04blue\c00 chair.  The table is covered with an \c07of\c03fw\c07hi\c03t\c07e\c00 knitted doily, a
huge vase of \c05f\c04l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c04r\c05s\c00 centered on the table.  Several paintings, done in
either chalk or paint, decorates the walls of the room, seeming to mostly
depict settings in which people were relaxed and having fun.

    <roombasic title="The Lord Dragon's War Room" vnum="28903" zone="289">
      <roomdescription>\c00The room is spacious, perhaps five spans square.  The middle of the east
wall is occupied by a large fireplace of \c01red\c00 brick.  Starting at the edges
of the fireplace and wrapping around the rest of the room, the walls are
painted in a mural of a \c02f\c23o\c02r\c23e\c02s\c23t\c02e\c23d\c00 mountain scene with a river flowing
through it.  The door on the west wall falls where the mouth of the river
would be.  On the floor, the carpet matches the mural, being green as
\c09grass\c00 on the sides with a \c02greenish\c00 \c04blue\c00 strip running from the fireplace
to the door in an irregular, meandering path to represent the river.  
Spaced evenly along the walls are lanterns of brass with panes of frosted
glass which, when all are burning, fill the room with a warm light.  The
furniture in the room is sparse, if ornate.  One large oak chair sits in
the southeast corner, every square inch of exposed \c03wood\c00 carved with
intricate designs and patterns and a \c02green\c00-fringed, \c02greenish\c00 \c04blue\c00 cushion
occupies the seat.  The only other piece of furniture is a large oak table
along the north wall covered with maps and papers, the legs as intricately
carved as the chair in the corner.

window.  The \c06ceiling\c00 is painted the same color as the \c06tile\c00.  A \c04tub\c00, tiled
in a darker blue is set into the middle of the floor.  Along the east and
west walls are metal racks hanging with thick, fluffy \c07white\c00 towels, each
bearing a rising \c03sun\c00 in the lower left corner.  High on the north wall is
a small window of \c07f\c06r\c07o\c06s\c07t\c06e\c07d\c00 glass.  Around the window, bright yellow \c10tile\c00 is
arranged in the shape of the rising \c03sun\c00 emblem of Cairhien.  The tub is
mostly square, except for the irregularity formed by the steps on the
south end that lead down into it.  A small stand rests near the northeast
corner, holding a \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 and \c10gold\c00 bucket with a \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 dipper for adding

      <roomdescription>\c00A tall french door leads out onto a balcony from the Lord Dragon's
chambers.  His room positioned in the southeastern corner of the palace,
creating a beautiful view of the city from this second floor balcony.  A
slight \c07br\c06ee\c07ze\c00 wafts in, carrying the aroma that smells faintly of horses
from the stables off to the west.  One can see for miles out over the
city, the people milling looks like ants at a picnic.  A single, high
backed chair sits on this ledge, the scrolling \c03woodwork\c00 seeming out of

\c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 trickling from holes and landing into a trough of water.  The trough
extends out to nearby flowerbeds, almost like an irrigation system, though

      <roomdescription>All the paths meet in the middle of the \c02g\c01a\c02r\c01d\c02e\c01n\c00, a huge fountain sitting at
it's center.  The fountain is circular, the basin of \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 spanning
perhaps five feet across, filled to the brim with \c06c\c07r\c06y\c07s\c06t\c07a\c06l\c00 clear liquid.  
Rising forth from the shallow depths of the \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 is a statue of woman in
a flowing robe.  She appears to be kneeling, her hands cupped as she seems
to drink from the small amount of \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 in her palms.  Her features
delicate,soft, her expression calm and it to add to the atmosphere of
serenity that this place seems to have been made for.  Four benches have
been placed around the fountain, forming a square as two face outward
towards the \c04f\c06l\c05o\c07w\c05e\c06r\c04s\c00 and others \c09vegetation\c00 that appears to be abundant
here.  The other two face towards the fountain itself, peering out onto
the calm, clear waters.  Flowerbeds have been arranged on the outer edges
of this area, the land around the fountain paved with \c03sand\c00 colored
cobblestones.  Four seperate pathways lead in opposite directions away
from here, each one at a different corner.

the checkered tiles and stone walls where the lanterns are hung upon the

have been carved into the stone walls, and these hold bowls and/or vases

dominating the decor.  Several piles of neatly stacked parchment adorn the
top of the desk, an enameled writing set consisting of an inkwell, a large
feathered quill and a small vial of \c03sand\c00 resting upon the top edge.  
Behind the desk sits a rather large, leather chair, its high back and
overstuffed cushions making it appear rather comfortable.  Two other
chairs sit in front of the desk, neither the size of the first but both of
leather and comfortable looking in their own right.  A fireplace rests in
the right wall, the mantle laden with decorative \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 plates, each
etched with different scenes of battle.  Along the western wall lies a
long, rich \c04blue\c00 couch, overstuffed pillows covering the comfortable
cushions at each end.  Resting on the wall behind the couch is a painting,
full of colors and details of a sunset on the river.

fresh cream.  The sheets are the same cream color and made of the finest
Shaaran silk.  Through the gauzy curtains the rest of the grand bedroom
can be seen.  The oaken bookcase, stained \c23black\c00 and formed of hard,
straight lines seems somehow less severe seen through the softening affect
of the gauze.  When the occasional \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00 from the balcony stirs the
curtains, the entire room outside the bed seems to waver.

and \c03gold\c00.  A large fluffy couch, laden with \c07cr\c03e\c07am\c00 colored pillows, sits
against the northern wall.  Thin threads of \c03gold\c00 and \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 woven into the
upholstery and the fabric of the pillows.  Two high backed chairs sit
across from the couch, both done in the same cream color with stripes of
\c03gold\c00 on one and the other done in \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00.  In between the couch and chairs
is a large oval table of \c01cherry\c00 stained wood, a large \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 teaset
resting upon the top.  A \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 dish sits next to the tray, sandwiches
arranged in a pyramid on one side and sweet cakes on the other.  A large
circular rug lies before a large stone fireplace, it's tassles made of
\c03gold\c00 and \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 in an alternating pattern.  The mantle of the fireplace
holds several different figurines, some carved from wood and others made
of delicate porcelain.

      <roomdescription>The door, encrusted with a rising \c03golden\c00 sun, opens up into another 
sitting room.  This one appears to be less formal then the one across 
the hall, done mostly in different shades of \c04b\c06l\c04u\c06e\c00.  Its cool stone floor
is almost completely covered by an intricately embroidered rug, done 
in vibrant sky \c06blue\c00 with \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 scroll work along each side.  Darker \c04blue\c00
tassles fan out to cover the unadorned edges of the room, tiny strings
of \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 mixed within.  Two chairs and a couch make a little sitting 
area in the middle of the rug, the chairs sitting opposite of the couch
with a long rectangular table resting in between.  The couch is made
of a soft \c06blue\c00 fabric with darker \c04blue\c00 stripes running vertical along it's
length, tiny tassled pillows resting on each end matching the color
and design.  Each chair is of a different color but both solid in design, 
the left being a dark \c04blue\c00 to match the rug and the right done in the 
same sky \c06blue\c00 as the couch.  A little pillow has been placed in each of
them, a dark \c04blue\c00 pillow resting on the light \c06blue\c00 chair; the light \c06blue\c00 
pillow on the dark \c04blue\c00 chair.  The table is covered with an \c07of\c03fw\c07hi\c03t\c07e\c00 
knitted doily, a huge vase of \c05f\c04l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c04r\c05s\c00 centered on the table.  Several 
paintings, done in either chalk or paint, decorates the walls of the room, 
seeming to mostly depict settings in which people were relaxed and 
having fun.

A small desk sits in the middle, surrounded by stacks of ledgers, each one
decorated with the different \c01seals\c00 of the Houses in Cairhien.  The room
seems almost unkempt compared to the rest of the palace, shelves that
should be used are merely collecting dust.  Papers are covering the top of
the desk, a small place cleared out for an \c04i\c23n\c04k\c23w\c04e\c23l\c04l\c00 and a quill with a tiny
vial of \c03sand\c00.  The only ornament is a \c10golden\c00 sun that rests on the wall
behind the desk, seeming to glow softly with the \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00 of the lanterns
that are scattered about the room.

leading into the room is covered with books, making it hard to tell where
the exit is when the door is closed.  A large fireplace rests on the final
wall, the top of the mantle is covered with figurines and carvings of
creatures that appear to be a mixture of real life and fantasy.  Two large
lanterns rest on the ends of the mantle along with others placed all
around the room that are casting a bright \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00, hardly any shadows even
in the far corners.  Placed in front of the fireplace are two overstuffed
chairs and a couch, set in just a way that presents a little square
sitting area to rest and read in the peace and quiet of the room.  An
oblong dark, \c01cherry\c00 stained table sits in the middle, a \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 teaset
resting atop next to a matching tray laden with sweet cakes and

more subdued somehow then the rest of the palace.  The servants barely

      <roomdescription>This room is a bustle of activity as women and men in palace \c04l\c03i\c07v\c04e\c03r\c07y\c00 run
around, most of them wearing \c07white\c00 aprons on the front of their clothing.
The aroma of cooked food wafts from the doorway, along with the sounds of
murmured voices and soft laughter.  A long counter covers three of the
four sides of this room, a huge stove resting against the fourth.  
Glowing \c01embers\c00 burn within the stove, the heat almost making it unbearable
to stand for long in this room, the top covered with pots and pans that
all hold delicious smelling food.  The pots and pans that are not in use
rest in a rack that hangs from the ceiling, a long rope tied off to one
side for raising and lowering it as needed.  A large window on the west
wall offers some relief as a soft \c06b\c07r\c06ee\c07z\c06e\c00 blows in, the view overlooking
the herb \c02garden\c00 that rests right outside the kitchen.  Shelves line the
walls on either side of the window, holding jars with different herbs and
spices.

palace.  It's door almost hidden in the \c23shadows\c00 of the hallway.  Many
doors line the hallway, servants seen bustling up and down the long
corridor in thier \c23dark \c04blue\c00 livery, trimmed with \c10gold\c00 and \c07white\c00.  The mood
seems a bit more relaxed amongst them here, nodding of head seen and
smiles upon their faces as the adjust their uniforms before going but to
their daily chores.

somber to the eye.  A large, rectangular rug rests in the middle of the
floor of this room, the stone floor peeking out from the edges.  \c22Grey\c00 and
\c23b\c03r\c23o\c03w\c23n\c03s\c00 almost seem to swirl together in an eye wrenching pattern across
the soft fabric.  One long couch rests on the western side of the rug,
three chairs set in a semi circle sits across the rug with a square, dark
stained table placed in the middle.  A large \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 teaset rests in the

of this room, four chairs rest on either side and then one more decorative
chair on each end.  A large floral arrangement rests in the center of the

tables sit against the walls of the room, both laden with \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 serving
dishes.  Matching silverware rests beside each piece, ready for any meal
to be served.  Upon the eastern and western walls are paintings, each
depicting a feast.  The first seams to be set in the exact room that the
picture rests in, a \c03golden\c00 haired woman is sitting at the head of the
table.  Her head is thrown back, a laugh erupting from her lips as she
holds a \c03golden\c00 goblet in one hand.  The others surrounding her also seem
to be enjoying themselves, each with a goblet within their grasp.  In the
other picture on the opposite wall is a meal that seems to have been held
in the main dining room of the hold.  Several tables are scattered around
the room with the center cleared for dancing.  A few couples are making
use of the space, even in the still painting their steps seem light.  
Eating and drinking are clearly abundant also, food on the plates of many
and \c08red\c00 wine flowing freely from bottles everywhere.

took great care in making the most of the amount of space they had
available to them.  The small bed is centered in the middle of the east
wall, a table resting on each side.  Behind one table is a small oval
mirror, the light of a lantern hanging next to the door reflecting in it's
\c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c23y\c00 depths.  A small wash basin and matching pitcher rests right below
the mirror, other small tolietries arranged in a neat little circle around
the bowl.  The other table is covered with a light \c06blue\c00 coverlet that
hangs to the floor, gentle ruffles sewn carefully around the edges.  A
framed chalkdrawn picture resting upon it's circular top, next to a vase
of fragrant \c05f\c04l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c04r\c05s\c00.  At the foot of the bed rests a small \c01c\c03e\c01d\c03a\c01r\c00 chest, a
small brass padlock keeping it warded against intruders.  The bed, itself,
is covered with a light \c06blue\c00 and \c07white\c00 checkered comforter and a single
fluffy white pillow at the head.  A small rocking chair rests in the
southwestern corner of the room, a matching \c06blue\c00 and \c07white\c00 checkered
cushion adorning it's \c03wooden\c00 seat.

      <roomdescription>Tall archways lead into a well lit room with huge vaulted ceilings.  
Three chandeliers hang from \c23steel\c00 chains, hundreds of different candles
lit, the flickering of their \c01fl\c03am\c01es\c00 casting dancing \c23shadows\c00 along the
walls.  The soft strands of music can be heard coming from the northern
part of this room where a miny orchestra seems to be set up.  Different
forms of entertainment can be seen around the room, several patched cloaks
of various \c01c\c06o\c05l\c03o\c02r\c04s\c00, hands moving so fast that it is hard to keep up as
balls of \c04blue\c00, \c02green\c00 and \c01red\c00 are tossed into the air and caught with ease.
The tellings of different tales are also caught in the merry mixture, high
chant and normal alike.  The oohs and ahhs of captivated audiences just
add more to the noise that is nearing intolerable levels.  Tables line the
walls of the room to offer rest for those not dancing or visiting the
different forms of entertainment.

      <roomdescription>Several guardsmen stand just on the inside of the door to the throne room,
looking impressive in their \c01red\c00 and \c07white\c00 colors, a stark contrast against
the gleaming \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00 of their armor.  None make a sound or even appear to
breathe, eyes looking around the room with wary attentiveness.  Massive
columns of \c04blue\c00 streaked marble line either side of this huge room,
marking the walkway down to the wide dais at the northern end.  A \c10golden\c00
mosaic of the \c03R\c10i\c03s\c10i\c03n\c10g\c03 S\c10u\c03n\c00 is set into the deep \c04blue\c00 tiles of the cool
floor, the soft \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00 of the candles reflect and appear to make it glimmer
softly.  Resting upon the raised platform is a huge, heavy armchair, it's
simple straight lines unbelievable with the \c10golden\c00 silk and gilding that
lay upon the wood.  Contrasting wavy lines rise at the back of the chair,
the shape of a sun rising to shine above any that sits here.

Gauzy \c07white\c00 material is wrapped around each post, draping down to the
floor in the unique form of a canopy bed.  A mountain of pillows rest at
the head of the bed, in a variety of \c02e\c23a\c02r\c03t\c02h\c23e\c02n\c00 shades to match and
compliment the soft \c02green\c00 and \c03c\c07r\c03e\c07a\c03m\c00 colored comforter.  Two tables rest on

trickling of \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 can be heard from a door that leads out towards the
north and a soft \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00 drifting in from a door that leads out onto the

up against the far wall, centered with two circular tables on either side.
A small pitcher and wash basin rest upon the top of one of the tables, the
other one covered a small \c03wooden\c00 box that appears to be locked.  An oval
mirror rests above the basin, it's \c07sh\c06im\c07me\c06ri\c07ng\c00 depths reflecting back to

furniture in the drab room.  It's stained wood a dark \c01cherry\c00 color that
glistens in the soft \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00 of the lanterns.  The back of the chair is
covered in small etchings, engraved \c02i\c07v\c02y\c00 vines creep up the sides and roses

      <roomdescription>A small step leads up into this dark stained structure, the \c03wooden\c00 surface
of the floor smooth and a touch glossy as the sun shines down.  The area
itself is in the shape of an octogon, benches lining seven sides of the
gazebo.  Each bench is long enough to seat about two people, a soft \c06blue\c00
cushion covering the wooden surface of every one.  Dangling down from the
conical shaped roof is a set of windchimes, the \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c23y\c00 surface of each
long tube sparkling in the light from the sun.  The soft, musical sound
filling the air as a gentle \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00 floats through.

      <roomdescription>At the end of this hallways lies a single door, not even a tapestry 
covering the smooth \c23s\c07t\c23o\c07n\c23e\c00 wall.  It is quiet, as if seperated from the 
bustling activity of the rest of this floor.  A single lantern is mounted 
upon the wall in the corner, casting \c23shadows\c00 upon the \c03wooden\c00 
surface of the door.

    <roombasic title="A Guest Bedroom" vnum="28997" zone="289">
      <roomdescription>A large canopy bed rests in the very center of this room, deep \c10red\c00
and \c03gold\c00 pillows lying atop a fluffy red comforter.  The canopy 
above the bed is a soft \c07cr\c03e\c07am\c00 color, with gauzy material wrapped 
around each of the four posts.  A huge fireplace rests on the east 
wall, the mantle holding numerous carvings and figurines that seem 
to all be made from \c03gold\c00 and \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00. Two chairs sit in the northern part
of the room, both high back with one in the same soft \c07cr\c03e\c07am\c00 of the 
canopy and the other in the deep \c10red\c00 of the comforter.  A small 
round table of dark, \c01cherry\c00 stained wood rests between them, two 
books atop its glossy surface.  Both leatherbound, though one is 
obviously thicker than the other with several \c07white\c00 ribbons marking 
places throughout it's withered pages.  Scattered over the hard stone
floors are the most elegant of rugs, all embroidered with fine threads 
of \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c00 and \c03gold\c00.  Their tassles arranged just so that each rug barely 
grazes the other across the stone surface.

    <roombasic title="A Bathing Chamber" vnum="28998" zone="289">
      <roomdescription>The door of the next room also leads into a bathing chamber, this 
one more luxurious then the first.  The pool of \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00 is situated 
in one corner of the room, the west and north walls making two 
of its sides.  The front edge is a semi-circle shaped with soft \c23gr\c07e\c23y\c00 
marble steps leading down in the steaming \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00.  Solid \c23black\c00 
marble columns rise up on the sides, a thin gauzy \c07white\c00 curtain 
flowing down to obscure the view into the bath itself.  A couch 
sits next to the bath, resting against the west wall of the room, 
fluffy \c04blue\c00 cushions look invitingly comfortable.  The rest of the 
floor is covered in cool \c23gr\c07e\c23y\c00 marble, though there are a few rugs 
scattered along the cool surface.  Each rug done in soft and vibrant 
shades of \c04b\c06l\c04u\c96e\c00, tassles of white mingled with threads of \c10gold\c00 and 
\c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00, drifting from the edges.  A simple \c03wooden\c00 shelf is mounted 
on the north wall, right above the pool of \c06w\c04a\c07t\c04e\c06r\c00.  The top lined with 
small vials and bars of scented soaps, burning incense filling the 
air with it's thick scent.

      <roomdescription>French double doors open up to a \c23s\c07t\c23o\c07n\c23e\c00 balcony, the view of the city 
breathtaking from the second story of the Sun Palace.  A faint \c06f\c05l\c07or\c05a\c06l\c00 
aroma wafts through the air from the square, immaculate \c01g\c02a\c01r\c02d\c01e\c02n\c01s\c00 directly 
beneath.
