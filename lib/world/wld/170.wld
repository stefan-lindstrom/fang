      <roomdescription>This is an enormous room, long and wide with a soaring ceiling.
Banners and tapestries line the walls, showing glorious battles and
opponents defeated.  Windows up near the ceiling brighten the room,
as do torches which line the walls in iron sockets and twin fires on
either side of the long hall.  The floor is inlaid with an enourmous
flaring sunburst, worn away by years of feet upon its surface.
There is a wide desk of polished oak at one end of the hall, shining
with gold inlay.  Behind the desk is a chair, a sunburst inlaid upon
the back so that the rays would radiate out from the head of the
man seated in it.  At the opposite end of the hall are a pair of dark
oak doors, steel reinforced and set deep into the gray stone walls.

be seen from a southern balcony. A torch flickers briefly on the wall, and
the stones beneath your feet feel a bit unstable. Lacking a handrail, it

      <roomdescription>You stand in a large room used to Question prisoners, and other social 
misfits. Well lit by 4 torches on each wall, the room still has a menacing
air. Several Inquisitors stand by, guarding a woman who looks worn out
and is bleeding profusely. An iron maiden stands open in the corner, and
looks well used. Pinchers and irons stand in a rack on the side. Various
whips are tied to the western wall, looking as if they would be painful.

      <roomdescription>A large chamber north of the Questioning room holds many tools used for
prying confessions out of darkfriends. The room is well lit, and the floor 
is covered with smooth stone tiles. A wooden rack, used for stretching 
darkfriends, lies to the west. A large table is east, and has many strange 
devices lying on it. A bowl of figs and a small cage containing mice are
also on the table. You wonder what they may be used for.
The majority of the room lies in darkness, the walls only showing as
the torch in the centre of the chamber sputters making harsh and evil seeming
shadows dance around the gathered equipment. The room is huge, the cieling
so high that you cannot see how far it continues nor much of the upper walls.

There seems to be a space in front of the scaffold, almost as if it was

some of the items found in this room, most likely confiscated from prisoners

to have a picnic beneath the azure skies of summer.
