      <roomdescription>Passing under the stone archway to the south brings you into
a vaulted chamber.  Bright murals depicting legends from the
Horn of Valere Saga cover the walls, the heroes so vividly
painted they almost seem alive.  In contrast the floor is made
of stone in muted ivory and grey.  To the east is a mapmakers 
shop while to the west mouthwatering smells of baking bread
and pies identify the shop as a bakery.   On the north wall 
a stone stairway leads up to the second floor balcony, which 
overlooks the lobby.  Stone mountings on the walls hold cut 
glass lamps and give the room a soft golden glow at night.

a bit of fashion from afar. A large \c10oak\c00 chair sits behind

against metal and the hiss of steam thrown up when hot metal
is thrust into cold water. In this room, however, various
tools and weapons line the walls, on display for anyone to
see and perhaps buy. Kylene apparently makes the items in
the back room and carries them here to be sold. A rack of
swords is set against the east wall, a price marked on the
rack as well as each sword. Also on the east wall, several
shelves hold small items of various uses, ranging from small
laquered wooden boxes to leather belt sheathes to hold daggers.

half a dozen hammers of varying thicknesses and handle lengths,
and next to them hang three thick leather vests. Several large
anvils rest on stone blocks in roughly the middle of the room, 
and four large metal-ringed barrels filled with what appears
to be water sit against the west wall. Whenever Kylene is not
in her tailor or craft shops or having tea in her living area

apprentices can be found here, working on various projects for
the good citizens of Andor.

and two cushioned stools, and a full-length mirror. Here
Kylene&apos;s customers come to try on their new clothes or to
have alterations made. The \c01dark red\c00 carpeting continues
from the curtained doorway south, as a courtesy to all the
customers here who are walking around in their bare feet.
Next to the desk, a small peg on the wall holds a coiled
yellow tape measure, and a slightly ajar drawer in the desk 
reveals several spools of thread, a small notepad, and an
extremely sharp pair of small scissors.

hanging over a four-poster bed covered with a soft white

wall is a washstand made of oak and intricately carved to
look as if the legs were made of wooden vines, sitting on
which is a porcelain washbasin painted with foamy blue waves.
Hanging above this is a large circular mirror, showing the
reflection of the large oak wardrobe sitting against the
opposite wall. The wall opposite the bed is nearly all made
of glass from a pace or so off the plushly carpeted floor,
a huge window that juts out from the rest of the wall so as
to form a cushioned seat, giving a view of the street below.
Next to the bed, a set of oak doors leads to another room

the west wall, lighting the room nicely yet avoiding the blazing
heat direct sunlight gives. Three plushly cushioned chairs sit
diagonally as corners of an imaginary square, all facing a small
table in the center of the square, with a face of etched glass
and molded iron legs. The fourth &apos;corner&apos; to the square is marked
with a white loveseat embroidered with tiny blue and gold flowers
and thin green vines. A small stand next to the door leading east
to the hallway holds a tray on which sits a sea folk porcelain
tea set, of a simple yet elegant pattern. This is where Kylene
sips tea with her best customers, discussing silk ball gowns and
the hardness of metals with equal ease, or just chatting about
the latest news of Andor and beyond.

is usually kept ajar to let some of the stifling heat out. A
hook in the wall holds a hanging lantern, though it is unlit.
Most likely, the heat is the reason for that as well. The
walls are unpainted, left as lightly finished wood, and the
floor is carpeted in a silvery white-grey that continues
under the door to the west here, but stops at the foot of the
stairs. You can see your reflection from afar, in the mirror
at the other end of the hallway. Several paintings line the
walls, of ocean and forest scenes.

      <roomdescription>At the end of the hallway here there is a small oak table
that looks to be for decoration only, though the small drawer
holds a few odds and ends, thimbles, scissors, and various
other sewing materials. Above the table is a fairly large
circular mirror, about two feet in diameter, reflecting the
hallway that extends behind you as you peer into it and
making it seem as though the hallway continues within the
mirror as well. Perhaps that is its purpose: to make the
space seem larger. Without the illusion, it is just a small
hallway with light wood walls and white-grey carpet that
lines the floor and trails underneath a pair of double doors
to the west.

      <roomdescription>Opening a wooden gate you step through into a small 
fenced yard.  The ground is covered in straw and smells
of horses and dung.  A wide door of a large stable stands
open to the north, while the sound of a hammer ringing on
steel carries from a smaller building to the south.

      <roomdescription>The air cools slightly and the smell of horse and 
leather intesifies as you walk into the stables. 
Horses in the wooden stall boxes whinny at your 
passing.  Saddles are draped over wooden rests 
while the other tack is hung neatly on a wall.
The floor is swept clean, with fresh straw in the
stalls for the horses.  The stableboys hurry to 
help you, or on their way to feed and groom the
horses in their charge. South you hear the sound 
of steel against steel.

      <roomdescription>The smell of smoke and heated metal is sharp in your nose as you
enter the smithy.  The heat from the forge is tremendous, but the
smith and his apprentices toil on, seeming to ignore it.  Tools of
all kinds are hung on the wall, as well as weapons and one plow.  A
large anvil rests near the forge while two smaller ones are nearby.
There is an open door to the north, and a smaller door to the south.

      <roomdescription>The heat lessons as you step out a doorway from the smithy
into a small covered breezeway.  Leather aprons hang
neatly from a set of pegs next to a large tub of water.
A wash stand holds clean shirts and a supply of towels
and soap. A set of wooden stairs leads up to a small
landing while another set of steps leads down to a door.

living area.  A stout wooden table sits on one side 
of the room in front of a small iron stove.  On the
other side of the room padded chairs are arranged
in front of a low table.  Small tables in corners
hold metal lamps that cast a \c03warm glow\c00 over the 
room.  There is a closed door on the west wall
