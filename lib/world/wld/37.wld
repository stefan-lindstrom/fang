      <roomdescription>This is the sewing room of Annika, head seamstress for the Tower.  As you walk in you hear the hustle and bustle of busy hands working on creating the beautiful gowns of the Aes Sedai.  In the room you see bolts of the finest silk, satin and wool.

    <roombasic title="The office of Lynnora Devon Aes Sedai, Keeper of the Chronicles" vnum="3701" zone="37">
      <roomdescription>A massive, polished oak desk fills the center of this room.  Carvings of
intertwining avedesora leaves begin at the base of the clawed feet and wind
their way up and throughout the desk.  Behind it is a large,
comfortable-looking wooden chair.  Facing it, is four more smaller chairs,
arranged in a semi-circle, their seats padded for comfort.  There are several
stacks of books and papers upon the surface of the desk, most of which are
neatly piled, though some are scattered haphazardly about.  There is an oil
lamp perched atop one of the books, shedding a soft glow upon the room.  The
wooden walls are polished to a dull shine, their surfaces reflecting the light
from the lamp, making the office seem larger than it is.  The west wall is
totally covered by a large bookcase, its shelves laden with books, papers, and
ledgers of all sorts.  On the east wall is a small window overlooking the alley
and the forest beyond, and on either side of it are paintings.  One is a
seascape of some sort, and the other is of the White Tower.

      <roomdescription>This is a small walkway between the Little Tower and the building recently built
just behind it, to be convenient for the Aes Sedai. This covered walkway leads 
to the skilled craftsmen and women the Aes Sedai employ for their personal
needs. Goldsmiths, candle makers, weavers, tailors, furniture makers of the 
highest skill have been retained for the Aes Sedai. Out past the building
where the craftsman have their shops are the stables.

      <roomdescription>The sound of feet working the spinning machines fill your ears.
As you walk in they quickly glance and smile then continue with
their work.  Hands working the wool, the spun thread, weaving
the beautiful shawls of the Rebel Sedai.  The blues, yellows,
greens and various colors depicting the ajahs blend together
in a striking contrast of the white walls.  Your eyes turn to the
locked chest that contain the finished shawls of the Aes Sedai.

      <roomdescription>This hallway is on the second floor of the new addition onto
the Little Tower that the Aes Sedai have made to, as always, 
serve their own purposes. Some Aes Sedai, rooms are on this 
floor, while below are a few, essential, craft rooms for the
use of the artisans the Aes Sedai have employed for their
everyday necessities. Although the smell of the Candlemaker&apos;s
shop is not always pleasant to live over, a scent of incense
and warm potpourri is much more preferable than the smell 
of the stables, which are also nearby.

      <roomdescription>The room you have entered is stark white with bare walls.
In the center of the room sits an aged man at a table formed
somehow from black granite.  He looks up as you enter the
room and nods slightly.  He quickly resumes his work which
is fashioning something that looks like a ring from solid gold.
His delicate fingers pick up the ring as he holds it to the light.
You seem to make out a curious pattern on the ring but just
as you think you see it, he goes back to work. It is hidden again
from your view, but you know you have truly seen a master
craftsman at work.

novices. The hallway ends here, with stairs leading down to the back door of
the building. A large g\c14las\c00s window over the staircase shows that the wind

branch out on this door with strange writings tipping
the end of each leaf.  The handle of the door is solid

quickly give you a wink before he turns back to the work at hand.

      <roomdescription>This area is quite different to the one adjoining it
to the south. A short walk north has brought you from
the uncontrolled growth of a jungle-type atmosphere 
to an almost serenity and strict order of perfection. 
The bushes are very neatly trimmed, and if they flower,
they display perfect white blooms. Green and silver is
mixed together in the most structured, yet pleasing
fashions, and the vegetation seems to flourish in an 
ecstasy of rigidity, only a delicate white petal 
interrupting the crystal calm of the wide, equilateral
triangular-shaped pool in the center.

separating this section of the baths from the others, 
clearly indicating, with dark green curtains, that this

seems like an overexuberant weed garden is almost 
overwhelmed by the chaos of the plants around it that 
border it almost to its very edges. If one looks closer,
however, one might be able to tell that instead of 
nature having free rein in here, the plants were actually
arranged to look the way they do. Long, thin reeds are 
tangled in the tall, bushy grasses, reaching out 
with green and brown tendrils to the edge of the 
water. A thick corridor of jungle-type branches and 
plants lead to and from this colder pool.

delicate shades of bluish-purple, pink, and white.

      <roomdescription>The only things in this room are a very large, circular,
porcelain tub, taking up most of the room in the middle
of the floor, and a small couch in one corner. The tub
is raised from the floor, and is accessible by three 
wooden steps, and it is panelled on the outside by a smooth
dark wood. Hanging on one edge of the tub is a small 
shelf of bath oils and salts, and a few towels hang on a 
couple of smooth brass hooks on the back of the door.

      <roomdescription>This room is somewhat on the small side, but it is big
enough to hold an extremely large porcelain tub, raised
from the ground, and shaped like a circle, with a dark
wooden exterior. Standing about waist-high, the edge of
the tub is accessible by the use of three wooden steps,
sanded smooth, but rough enough so that you wouldn&apos;t 
slip trying to get in or out of it. Hanging from one 
side of the edge of the tub is a good-sized wooden shelf
containing all sorts of bath oils and salts.

      <roomdescription>This small room radiates an aura of comfort from the moment it is entered.  On
the east wall is a large window that looks out upon an allyway and the greenery
of the forest beyond.  Beneath the window is a long wooden bench, cushioned for
comfort.  It is there that many have sat, waiting for an audience with the
Keeper.  On the south wall is a large bookcase, its shelves laden with several
books on a wide variety of topics.  On the north wall, next to the doorway that
leads to the Keeper&apos;s office, is a painting that depicts a lone Aes Sedai and
her warder fighting a group of shadowspawn.

entire east wall is covered by a large bookcase, its wooden shelves laden with
books, papers, notes, and various odd-looking objects.  On the north wall
resides a desk, upon which more books and papers are stacked, but in a much
less orderly fashion than in the office.  Behind the desk is a small wooden
chair who&apos;s seat appears to be worn with use.  On the west wall is a narrow
bed, covered with a simple patchwork quilt.  There are no decorations to speak
of, not even a picture on one of the few patches of unoccupied wallspace.  
This room speaks of utility, not comfort, as if its owner does not care about
such things.

      <roomdescription>You have entered a beautiful cove surrounded by high craggy rock cliffs.
The cove has been created by years of erosion by the waves of the
Arynth Ocean.  As you look up the rocks gleam almost a golden-yellow on
the limestone background.  The sun setting casts almost a bronze as it
sets upon the ocean.  The black sand is inviting as it sparkles with the
gleaming setting sun.  Above you the birds soar lazily and as you look
out onto the ocean the waves quietly lap the sand.

it&apos;s not really clear what is back there.

of how they are situated, having quite a nice view of the riverfront.
The ones on the east side, however, have much larger yard areas, and 
inevitably, there are a few girls in white picking weeds, planting
vegetables or flowers, and scrubbing windows and doorsteps for the
owners of the houses, which are, of course, Aes Sedai.

      <roomdescription>Because Salidar has always been a small town, and it has just recently
recovered from long-time abandonment to house the overflowing numbers
of Aes Sedai and Warders, novices, accepted, and various others that 
the Aes Sedai employ, there are not many places where one can find 
fresh water, since not that many wells were needed before. In this 
small square, a new well has been dug. Quite a large one, too. Being
in the neighborhood of the Aes Sedai, it is, of course, functional, 
yet important-looking as rocks surrounding a hole can get. There are
built-in steps up to the mouth of the well, low and wide, that can be
used as sitting-places, if one takes a notion to do so.

the trees seem to get larger, their branches longer, their leaves 
more numerous, as if sensing that the inhabitants of the land beneath
them wish for more shade. And truly, somehow everything seems perfectly
arranged, the more delicate larkspur and lavender plants softly 
covered in cool areas out of the sun, and the hardier roses and 
climbing plants seem to flourish in the gaps where the sun shines
through.

Little Tower can be clearly seen, the biggest building in this small
town, and to the north a small patch of denser vegetation can be seen, 
in the form of a small park alongside the river. At the intersection,
a swift breeze whips through with a loud rustling sound, stirring all
the leaves both on the ground and on the living plants, as well. 
Of course, the Aes Sedai passing by seem to take no notice of it, 
though everyone else holds onto hats and skirts tightly.

stone tablets, standing erect at each side of the smooth dirt

willow trees here, spreading their limp branches in such a way 
that the ends dangle lowly over where the path enters the park. 
The supple leaves and branches intertwine in a pleasant fashion, 
low enough to almost brush up against anyone who walks under them, 
forming a natural arch over the entrance.

beneath large, shady trees. There is a small flower garden to the
north, its bright blooms visible even from here.

delicate garden flowers, like tulip and whitebell. The small
garden is bisected in an east-west direction, with an extension
of the pathway wandering through the lush blooms. There is 
one small, backless, stone bench in the exact middle, where
one could sit in quiet contemplation, the rush of the river
and the buzzing of the bees as they flit from flower to 
flower the only disturbances.

heavy fruit, and roses, on the outside, the reds and whites of the

Three stone benches are arranged beneath it, in a semicircular

fish or go look at the river, or perhaps even take a swim if one is inclined to
do so.  Several benches sit along the banks, overlooking the river.
