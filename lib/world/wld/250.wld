      <roomdescription>You stand in an ivory spire, looking like those fabled _\c07Ivory
Towers\c00_ of legend. White ogier carved stone builds this tower,
and carvings of Avendesora leaves decorate the parapets. There are
a dozen or so floors to this tower, and you can see a large marble
staircase spiraling downwards at the center of each floor landing,
looking dangerously frail. From this height - you imagine that you
are on the eighth floor or so - you see the entire length of Ebou
Dar spread out before you to the south. The Rahad lies to the east,
its crooked streets a relief in comparison to the straight laneways
of the rest of Ebou Dar.

a large square can be seen off in the distance.

      <roomdescription>Warehouses, piers, and boats are all you see along this busy
street. The Bay extends into the distance to the east while
the city looms above you to the west. Directly west are several
piers, and the length of the Bay of Ebou Dar stretches out
before you, making you gasp as you see the wide stretch of water.
You look to the southeast and the water never seems to end. To
the north is a small intersection and a canal rushes by, under
a small bridge. To the north you see the northeast tower of
the city walls where it ends and the bay begins.
