    <roombasic title="Southern Gatehouse" vnum="14000" zone="140">
      <roomdescription>This gatehouse is sparsely and simply furnished in an austere fashion.
A small desk surrounded by several plain wooden chairs sits in the middle
of the room, a small, threadbare couch rests against the western wall,
and a large brass bound trunk has been placed against the southern wall.
This gatehouse is a checkpoint between the city of Bandar Eban and the
untamed wilderness beyond to the south.  Here is where the gate guards
bring suspicious individuals to be examined and questioned before
they enter the city and bring potential malice.  They will soon be searched
and questioned to make certain that they are indeed not a threat.

    <roombasic title="The Southern Gates of Bandar Eban" vnum="14001" zone="140">
      <roomdescription>The towering Southern Gate of Bandar Eban rises high above the earth here.
The gates themselves are opened wide, allowing the people crowding the road
from the Almoth Plain to stream fluidly into the wide streets of the 
beautiful city.  A mass of people crowds the street for yards back, 
spilling off into the grassy fields with their horses and wagons as 
the gate guard examine the travellers and refugees that seek entry.  There
are many who seek entry into the city. Peddlers, travellers, pilgrims and
refugees are but a few of the people who have come to Bandar Eban to try
their luck and seek their fortune.  Local farmers mill about impatiently,
muttering about the crowds and newcomers and how the clog their entry. 
An occasional noble prances by on his or her horse, ignoring the line
and entering the majestic gates and the large city beyond.

      <roomdescription>A large square of mammoth proportions spreads for over a hundred yards
in any given direction here.  There are a near constant stream of people
milling about here as they enter the capital of Arad Doman.  The din
of the noise is overwhelming, the shouts of peddlers ringing out overhead
and the murmur of casual conversation all coalescing into an almost deafening
thunder.  The stalls of hawkers and peddlers have been established all
over the cobbled square, selling treats and trinkets to flustered newcomers
and city residents alike.  The throng overflows into all the sidestreets,
forcing the people onward as the crowd continues to grow and surge.

      <roomdescription>To the east, the bustling of the Southern Square is heard as a low, yet
constant rumble that signals the constant buzz of activity occurring there.
Though travellers and foreigners wander here, the people tend to be Domani
in origin, evidenced by the fashions they wear and they coppery skin of
the people.  People stream through in a constant flow, obviously heading
to the various high class areas of the city.  Master Ashton&apos;s Gaming Hall
lies some distance to the north, though the faint music of its revelry
can be heard even here.  To the west lies the Fragrant Lily Inn, famous
for its beautiful rooms and relaxing atmosphere.

here enjoy a majestic view of the rolling oceans and the forested grasslands
that lead to the sandy beaches in the southwest.  A narrow yet well kept
alley lies to the north, while Eban Street continues its path along the
southern wall to the east and west.

famed Fragrant Lily Inn.  The street outside is extremely clean and well 
cared for, as is the building itself.  The building is of pure white, 
trimmed in lighter shades of blue, and rose bushes dot the walls outside.
The building all in all has a very peaceful, easy air about it.  The
sign outside is of carefully carved pine, painted blue with the image of
a single lily carved upon it.  The sign waves back and forth in the cool
ocean breeze, beckoning you to enter.

relaxing rhythm.  Lilies are abundant everywhere in the room, growing beside
the fountain, in lush bunches in pots, or dangling from the ceiling in
ornate macramae.  There is a stairway leading up to the guest rooms, and
laughter can be heard coming from either room adjacent to this one.

to have their orders taken in the sprawling lounge on the opposite side of
the lobby.

drawers.  On the southern wall is a large desk of matching color with many
shelves to store things, and equipped with all the necessities one would

of the open windows, blowing the smell of the rose garden below into the
room.

roses in full bloom, baby&apos;s breath and leafy green foliage.  Surrounding
the table are three plush chairs upholstered with fine white satin and
stitched with floral displays in pinks, purples and greens.  The large
canopied bed sits in one corner, its light pink comforters and lacy pillows
neatly made.  Gauzy curtains are tied back to the posters of the bed, 
and are tied back with soft pink silk ribbons.  Opposite the desk is a desk
of pure white oak with many drawers.  A window is situated between the desk
and bed, allowing a marvelous view of the forests when the elegant pink
curtains are drawn.

or beggar can be seen skulking through.  Immediately to the west stands an 
old lighthouse that has been converted into a collection of novelty shops.
The lighthouse itself grew into disuse as the city expanded to encompass it,
then surpass it as the dock quarter was established beyond the wall to the
west.

and the slim forms of the barmaids can be seen in the upper windows.

      <roomdescription>A hard packed dirt pathway leads into this small clearing from the east,
widening as it reaches the edge of the trees surrounding a small pond.
The gleaming water reflects the rays of filtered sunlight that trickles
down through the thick canopy above.  A handful of ducks idly swim along
the pond, sending ripples along its otherwise calm surface.  A few benches
surround the pond, allowing a place for the weary citizen to rest their
feet.  The towering Western Wall is a constant reminder that you are in
the city of Bandar Eban, as is the occasional clamor that can be heard 
from the dainty slipper to the east.

      <roomdescription>A cool, salty breeze blows through the large, open square that lies before
the Western Gates of Bandar Eban.  Standing just inside the gates is a large
flagstone square, over a hundred feet on a side.   The square itself is 
neatly kept, lined with benches and large, sweeping oak trees on the sides.
Sailors of all ports of call gather here when entering the main city, either
hopelessly drunk, or attempting to be on their best behavior.  Looking out
the gates, one has a perfect view of the crystal blue oceans and clear skies
beyond.  The bustle of the dock quarter is heard outside the gates, down
the hill from the main city and nestled close against the banks of the 
ocean.  Ships are visible pulling into the docks from here, looking tiny 
and small, almost like a child&apos;s miniature as you look out on this 
picturesque seascape.

large hill that looms over the rest of the city.  Looking upwards, the 
scattered homes of the middle class are visible, perched on the sides of 
the hill snugly.  Shops and small businesses prevail here, however, 
thriving in the jumble and maze of streets that weave through this quarter
like a warren.  The sounds of the populace, so overwhelming in other parts
of the city, are all but absent here, replaced by a quiet lull and 
peacefulness.

they were the elite and had nothing else to do but idle about lazily as

themselves lying back yards from the walkways.  Large magnolia trees drape
across the street with their leafy boughs, giving the entire area a calm,

eye for mischief while he talks to the citizens who live in the area as if
he were acquainted with them all.

in general as they near the peak of the hill, and the mercantile area that

supply novelty items to the people passing by.  A trio of young Domani
women, all clad in the briefest of silk wraps stand here, smiling alluringly
at the men as they pass by, regardless of who they are or what they look
like.  An older woman watches them with distaste, often showing them a thing
or two where her practiced and aged seduction often shows their brazen
attitudes a thing or two as she is the object of more men&apos;s attention.

Local citizens pass through here frequently, as this is the main mercantile 
section of this quarter.  General stores and specialty shops here provide
for the everyday needs of the people.  The populace of the quarter tends to
gravitate here for social reasons as well, the women gossiping as they
tap, pinch, and shake produce, and the men standing aloof in small groups,
smoking pipes and talking about their exploits.

are unable to handle the treacherous incline.  Most of this area lies snugly
in the shadow of the pinnacle of the hill.  There are few times of the day
that this area is exposed to the light of the sun.  Several dwellings 
cling to the hillside, seeming to defy gravity as they look over the rest 
of the city below.  To either direction the noises of commerce and trade
arise as the local people throng to them to do their daily shopping.

front yards are sacrificed due to limited space.  The echo of boots on
the flagstone road sound up and down the street.  A small flock of sparrows
alight overhead, chirping and twittering a lovely sound before perching
in a large, leafy tree.

sharply halfway down for an easier route.  This street is primarily one for
the local merchants, with a multitude of shops to either side of the
neatly paved road.  Construction here tends to be of two stories, with the
main floor being the area for the shop while the upper level provides a 
home for the merchant and his family.  This is most probably done to provide
the greatest amount of living space possible while taking up as little room
on the side of the hill itself.  Pedestrians with full bags of goods
pass by going either direction as they go about their day&apos;s shopping.

A few ragged travellers from the Borderland of Saldaea trickle slowly into
the city, though at no regular interval, and often with long periods of time
in between.  Now and then a trading caravan will clamber by in either
direction, usually seeking or delivering the famous Saldaean Ice Peppers,
and occasionally something more rare and valuable from the north.

      <roomdescription>The spiraling lane continues here, its neatly cobbled street lying between
to strings of quiet homes with the occasional merchant&apos;s shop set in them.
Several large trees shadow the street with their leafy boughs, rolling
gently in the soft breeze.  The savory smell of delicious food cooking
emanates from the surrounding homes, filling the air with their delectable
scent.  Looking down the side of the hill, the large white gazebo that
marks the center of the town is clearly visible, as are the masses of people
that throng there daily, and, listening carefully, one can hear the murmur
of the surging crowd as they go about their business.

that the hill provides.  Large, multi-storied homes line either side of the
avenue, almost blocking the view of the city entirely from the street.  The
scent of baking bread and cooking meat fill the air as the women in the area
prepare their meals for their families.  A small cluster of thin Domani men
of advancing age talk quietly amongst themselves on one of the corners to
pass the time.  An occasional carriage trundles through, but foot traffic
is more popular by far in this modest residential area.

air of the building is one of the ruggedness of the outdoors.  A single
small window looks out onto the street, unwashed and unpolished for some

light the enter from the outside.  Upon the walls are examples of the
handiwork of the craftsmen of the shop.  Sturdy pouches, and waterproof 
backpacks, saddles, harnesses, torches and lanterns are all prominently
displayed.  On the chipped and scarred counter are a collection of small
hunting knives essential for living in the wilds for any length of time.
Bernard is fully prepared to equip any traveller to go into the dangerous
wilds about Bandar Eban.

About the room are woven wicker baskets with bundles of herbs, poultices,

wooden shelves along the walls.  A small bag of herbs and medical instruments
rest upon one of the nightstands.  A fold out cot is in the corner in case
of emergencies, as are a pile of thick blankets and several bundles of
bandages, freshly washed and rolled.

entire southern portion of the city.  The tiled roofs of Bandar Eban&apos;s
many buildings dot the horizon likes grains of sand along the seashore,
glinting brightly as they reflect the light of the noonday sun.  This
portion of the street is an immaculately kept and tended row of private 
homes.  The houses are small, whitewashed structures of only two stories
that are packed together at odd angles to suit the structure of the hill.
A few children play ball in the streets as their mothers look on, eyeing
passing strangers with a large dose of wariness and curiosity.

Street, whether just off the boats in the harbor, or just happening to be
here, one can only guess.  Several curiosity shops line the streets, their
wares displayed in their large glass windows.  A small band of children
darts back and forth among the streets, nearly falling beneath the path
of several horses in their play, causing the shouts of angry and frustrated
riders.  Nearby, the loud sound of music is heard, and the smell of fresh
food.  Scanning around, it seems to originate from a large, multistoried
building to the southwest, where shadowy shapes pass by the illuminated
upper windows.

along with the arrogant sniffs of the wealthy members of the gentry. Almost
equidistant between the Western Gates, and the Center of Town, it is possible
for one to catch a view of both as they pass through.  Several dock workers,
evidence of the nearness of the ports, swagger through, eyeing women and
looking for drink, while at the same time, the buzz of the commerical 
activity in the square can still be heard. To the north rises a steep hill,
unscalable here, but it is possible to see the terraced homes dotted among
the more prevalent shops and businesses.

the quiet residential areas of the southwestern quarter.  Though there are
many people in the streets, only some of them seem to be in a rush to get
anywhere.  Other people tend to idle, chattering in small groups to one
another as they pass the time.  Looking to the south, a quaint building is
visible near the center of a rather large square, framed by large elm trees
to either side.  This is the Lusty Lady Tavern, a popular are for the local
residents to come and relax after a long day of labor.

the Lusty Lady Inn, giving way to the soothing chords of a harp and 
recorder coming from the establishment.  The square itself is blanketed in
a comfortable shade.  The inn is rather small in construction compared to
the buildings towering about it, and in fact looks much like an oversized
cottage more than an Inn.  It is a single story affair of an off white 
color and trimmed in bare timber, with a simple thatch roof.  The windows
stream light out into the square, drawing the eyes of many pedestrians,
often pulling them in for a drink before they head home after a hard day
of labor.

sturdy tables and chairs and a long, heavy oak bar, all polished to a glossy
sheen.  The smell of spiced potatoes and roasting meat emanate from the
kitchen, making mouths water.  Tapped kegs of ale, along with finer, more
expensive drink line the counter behind the bar, poured freely and often
to the thirsty customers.  Looking out the windows, one catches sight of the
sleepy, peaceful square outside.

This is where the wealthy merchants of the city store the precious imports

number, the contents are expensive and rare, making them quite valuable 
indeed.  Guards stand beside each and every entrance, wearing the colors
of various merchant households, and glaring suspiciously and openly at 
anyone lingering too long near any one of the warehouses.

The wise pedestrian often decides to hurry on to somewhere more desirable.

      <roomdescription>This quiet narrow stretch of cobbled street bends towards the southeast as
light traffic enters from the west.  Few people tend to travel this way 
unless wishing to take a scenic view of the well kept homes with thickly
thatched roofs.  A group of matrons stand before the steps of one of the 
homes, gossiping idly and giving suspicious looks to the strangers who pass
by.

      <roomdescription>This stretch of cobblestone street is quiet and at peace, with small groups
of people being the only traffic.  The area is residential, with many 
multistoried houses and high fences, marking the fringe of the quarter of 
the city&apos;s elite.  Watchmen occasionally walk through, keeping a steady
eye on those who look as if they do not belong, making those few who do
consider loitering elsewhere.

The people here carry themselves with a grace that only the nobility can,
freely spending money on a carpet that would keep many small farms in

through with balls, and spinning large hoops with sticks.  Peddlers hawk
their wares, shouting at passersby for patronage for their vast array of 
novelty items.  Looking up you see the massive edifice of Master Cedric&apos;s
Gaming Hall, a many gabled building of rich white plaster, trimmed dark 
shades of blue.  A gargantuan double door opens to the street, allowing
the sounds of the recreation inside to spill into the street.  Two lovely
Domani girls stand beside the door, their flirtatious gazes drawing in
unwary men with a purse of coins to spare.

main gaming area.  The entire room is decorated in lush floral arrangements
in colorful patterns and designs, whether placed at random intervals in
the room, or upon small stands carved to resemble miniature pillars.

an almost pleasant sound.  A small group of musicians play in one corner
their bawdy and festive lyrics inspiring many couples to dance mirthfully
about them.  A gleeman or two is seen weaving through the crowd, performing
small stories, acrobatic feats and sleight of hand to amuse and delight.  The
hostesses mingle with everyone in the dimly lit room, generally escorting
them to either the bar, or one of the gaming tables while seeming to be
engaged in friendly conversation, and occasionally escorting the more drunken
and impoverished to the small, infrequently used back door.

more private conversation.  In addition to these are a scattering of round

go about the games.  Scantily clad women serve drings, cutting deftly 
through the boisterous crowd.  The room is papered in a burnt siena, with
light fixtures illuminating small areas about them dimly with a golden glow.
The carpet is thin and of a dark azure, though sticky from wear and age.  The
tables are made of sturdy polished wood, though the crowding and bustling of
the gamblers leaves small chips and dings in their former beauty.  The din
of the hall is great, either with the cheers of joy from the winners, or
more often, the groans of dispair from the losers.

wraps and glittering jewels, whispering softly to each other.  At either
end of the hall is a private dining and gaming room, equidistant from the

shops selling staple items.  The buildings are clean and tidy, though nowhere
close to the extravagance seen elsewhere in the quarter.  Gaudy women in
clingy and revealing silk stand behind the Gaming Hall, escorting the 
drunkards leaving through the back, and whatever is left of their coinage,
away.

transporting kegs of ale, a woman hawking bolts of silken cloth, and even

of the fountain is a sprawling gazebo, lifted above the ground by thick 
pillars upon which rests a domed, vaulted roof which keeps the heat off 
of the occupants within.  The walls are constructed of whitewashed wooden 
slats placed in a crisscrossing formation rising three feet from the sturdy 
wooden floor.  The gazebo is entered by a set of wide stairs with sweeping 
and intricately carved banisters. To either side of the stairs and 
surrounding the gazebo are lush rosebushes and brilliant beds of tulips 
that add a splash of color to the otherwise snow white structure.

covers the wall above, drips of water running across it in small rivulets.
Small flowering plants with dainty yet colorful flowers have taken root

Adding to the seclusion is a drapery of lush vines the fall over the entrance,
the leafs of the ivy blocking direct view from the outside and dimming the

a large gap where about a dozen books have been removed, and some

The books were probably taken by the young girl who sits at a desk
in what looks like a little alcove, where the shelves that line the
walls from ceiling to floor have separated to allow the desk in.

      <roomdescription>\c00Shelves line the wall here as they do everywhere around the library,
surrounding a narrow guarded doorway marked &quot;\c10Rare Books\c00.&quot; The rare
books section of the Terhana library has three entrances, all well-
guarded against theft. In this section of the rare book area, desks
and chairs of all shapes and sizes are scattered about the room, in
a group in the center of the room as well as between the many shelves
that hold the books themselves. At one wall the shelves surround a
large couch big enough for even an ogier to lie down on, made of
\c05purple\c00 and \c04blue\c00 velvet swirled together in an intricate pattern.
It looks extremely comfortable, a pleasant napping place, were it not
for the thin coating of dust, which would surely cause an embarassing
sneezing fit in this incredibly quiet room.

      <roomdescription>\c00Looking up and to the east, you can see the railing that cuts off the
second floor and allows those browsing in Philosophy to look down
upon those in the History section of the library. This part of the
History section is mostly a study area, with several small individual
desks spaced evenly surrounding three large circular tables arranged
in a triangle. Most of the tables are covered with books and notes,
though not all of those desks that are covered are occupied. Several
of the people sitting at the desks are quite pale and look as if they
have not seen sunlight in several days or even weeks. The vaulted
ceiling echos the smallest sounds made here, those of a chair scraping
against the stone floor or a muted whisper.

      <roomdescription>\c00There is no room at all to sit down here without blocking the narrow
walkways between the bookshelves, which are crowded extremely close
together. The dust here is quite thick in places, it being a remote
part of the history section. At the top of some of the shelves, a
few \c07c\c00o\c07b\c00w\c07e\c00b\c07s\c00 cling to the corners in places that the janitor of the
library could not reach. On the top shelf ledge, a pair of thin-
framed eyeglasses sit neatly folded and covered with dust, obviously
long since forgotten by some absentminded person who needed both
hands to carry all the books they wanted and did not think to put
their glasses on. A librarian moves easily about the shelves with
an armload of books, not seeming to notice the cramped quarters or
even your presence as she glides past you, causing you to press
yourself flat against a shelf to avoid a collision.

the dusty shelves here. This is one of the darker parts of the library,
as there are relatively few \c10windows\c00 compared to the other areas. A 
\c04blue\c00 cloak hangs on the back of a chair that has been hastily
pushed back from one of the smaller tables covered with books. At
another desk, a young boy is slouched over, his head nodding as though
he keeps dozing off. Both ladders climbing up the walls are empty, just
waiting for someone to climb up and explore the highest shelves. The
dozing boy nods off and wakes up suddenly with a gasp that permeates to
the farthest corner of the room, making it seem like a deafening shout,
when in reality it was only a sharp inhalation. A librarian looks up with
a scolding look on her face, looking for the culprit.

Library, if that is possible. A librarian sitting at a desk in the
corner makes sure that the silence is maintained, though with this
crowd it is doubtful that she has too much trouble. Most of them are
rather subdued, and look as if they feel guilty just clearing their
throat or scraping a chair across the floor. Two women wrapped in
brown shawls sit across from each other at twin desks, with a poise
and grace that somehow draws the eyes to them. Occasionally, one or
the other stands up and walks to a large podium set against one wall
and studies what appears to be a huge leatherbound book, the pages
of which are yellow with age and almost look like they would crumble
to dust under your fingertips.

      <roomdescription>As the Wheel of Time Turns, many of the writers laced into the pattern
have also woven their thoughts directly into the pattern, by way of
what are now old, crumbling manuscripts and slightly jumbled ramblings
of men and women who took the time to write their thoughts on how to
rule a kingdom, what the best way to think about the meaning of the
pattern is, or any number of seemingly random thoughts on various
subjects. Some of these manuscripts and tattered scraps of paper are
kept here, in this section of the Terhana Library. It is not a large
section, but it is frequented by many, as all who come to the second
floor of the library must pass through here. Nor is it the quietest  
section of the library: from time to time one of the people sitting
at the scattered desks begins furiously murmuring to him or herself,
scribbling notes for several minutes and then abruptly stopping.

here, collections with dozens of volumes of books, some of which are  
missing a book or two. These books are no doubt on the tables which   
are encircled by the rows of shelves and the shelved walls, collecting
in piles that seem to envelop those who sit between them, casually
flipping the pages and taking notes, or reading with a finger trailing
down the page to mark which line is being read. In the far corner, a
small boy is dozing off, leaning against a wall, book slowly slipping
down in his hands to rest on his legs, until the time when he awakes
with a start and tries to begin reading again, restarting the whole
cycle that so often afflicts these boys who would probably rather be  
out learning the ways of hunting or going on daring adventures with   
friends.

are of all classes, all shapes and sizes. Here, couches, cushions and
padded upholstered chairs outnumber the oak tables and straighbacked
chairs. This was a wise move by the librarian; many of the people here
seem to have settled themselves in with just one book, rather than the
multitudes that pile themselves around people in other sections, but
here those with one book seem to be the ones staying the longest, often
reading the entire book before getting up to leave, staying from dawn
until closing time, with nothing to eat all day but perhaps a scrap of
bread and cheese smuggled in without the notice of the librarian&apos;s
sharp gaze.

      <roomdescription>Several copies of \c07The Travels of Jean Farstrider\c00 indicate this to
be the Travels section of Terhana Library - that is, in addition to the
decorations on the unshelved walls, which seem to have been collected   
from all over the world, and the manner of many of the people here, some
of whom have the look that says they might get up and walk out at any 
moment, never to come to Bandar Eban again. This place has a vastly 
different feel to it than other sections of the library, most likely
because of the hangings on the walls. Everywhere else in the library,
the shelves leave no room for anything other than a small desk set in
against the wall, or even a couch, but there are large square sections
of the wall here that seem to have been set aside expressly for the
hanging of materials collected from travel, somehow giving the section 
an exotic feel, if that is possible for a library.

      <roomdescription>A narrow spiralling stairway leads upwards into what must look from    
the outside like a small tower in the library. Inside, it is actually
a small alcove, barely big enough for one person, though possibly two
could find themselves here if they were close friends, or more. A dark
red velvet loveseat sits just below a small window that can be tilted
open just slightly to allow a small breeze to pass through, or a few
drops of rain to scatter on the cushions. The ceiling is extremely
low and slanted, reaching its highest point at the top of the window,
its lowest point being so low that it would be difficult for anyone
other than a small boy to stand up underneath it. An oval rug woven
fairly intricately with lush green vines and red and white roses      
somehow gives the feel of being trapped in a garden, as do the walls, 
painted with the same scenery, and the birdcage in the corner, inside 
which sits a robin, who chirps happily whenever anyone comes into the 
room.

of war and in hushed tones, the role that the Dragon Reborn plays in it 
all.  In the center of the Plaza is a single magnolia tree, ringed in

Benches form a ring around the planter itself, and the cobbled walkway

fire in a waste dispenser, using filth and trash as kindling to feed the
fire.  Another vagrant picks through the garbage, either oblivious or

      <roomdescription>The faint sounds of twittering birds as they dart above the avenue fill
the air with their song.  A few homes of the ruling nobility line the 
southern half of the street, each manor encircled by a wall and the gates
stationed with personal guardsmen.  The palace is visible to the southwest,
its alabaster spires domination the horizon with their glory.  A group of
men and a few women stand in the middle of the intersection, each wearing
the livery of a different noble house.  The sounds of their bickering
become louder and louder.  Examining closer it is possible to see that their
has been some sort of collision, leaving a pile of groceries lying in a 
mucky puddle in the street.

situated, leading to Northside Walk.  Large buildings loom ominously 
about, their massive granite blocks firmly placed against one another to
form magnificent, yet imposing structures.  Elegantly dressed women stand
at the base of a flight of steps leading up to one of these buildings,
beautiful for both their physical attractiveness, and alluring grace.  
Glancing up at the building they murmur in hushed whispers to themselves,
oblivious to anyone else around them.

through the grassy knoll that serves as a small park for the inhabitants
of the area.  The mirthful laughter of the children as they romp around
ancienct oak trees and sprawling weeping willows ring in the air.  A group
of women that can only be their mothers sit on the nearby benches, watching
placidly and gossiping amongst themselves.  A pair of young nobles saunter
through, casting haughtly glances about and sneering with their cavalier
expressions at the commoners.  Trees encircle and shade the courtyard
completely, making it a restful place to stop and spend an afternoon.

The scent of their petals drifts in the air, causing the passerby to

a cobbled walk, behind which stand rather large private homes.  The lawn

into each others eyes as they sit and enjoy the peaceful beauty.

here, with small lines with carefully tended gardens.  The street is spotless
and free of refuse of any sort.  Members of the city watch stride through

pretending that the teenagers are not there, or that their youthful 
exuberance is nothing out of the ordinary.

flowers that add a splash of color to the otherwise pure white walls of the

path of Eastern Street.  The street is relatively narrow for such an active
thoroughfare, the buildings to either side come right up to the very cobbles.
The dwellings here are narrow but long and tall, reaching up to three stories
in height.  The working classes throng the streets and fill the windows.
The people here are good natured for the most part, and boisterous, their
chatter humming through the air with a friendly buzz.  The commerce of the
Center spills over lightly into this portion of the street, the shopping
crowds milling about as strangers, but receiving patient, good natured 
smiles from the residents nonetheless.

Against the northern wall is a long wooden partition, behind which sits a 
row of young women with warm smiles.  The tellers keep a record of their 
transactions on thin sheets of paper with quill pens with which they write 
immaculately. They often leave their positions when dealing with customers, 
returning from the back with small pouches that they hand out after 
receiving a signature from the recipient.  Burly guardsmen stand silently 
in the background, their hands never far from the hilts of their swords 
and their gazes always scrutinizing and watchful.

in the middle of the paved street, paying no heed to the passing traffic as
they cause no end of trouble for carts and people on foot.  People mill 
about slowly, talking as though they were lifelong friends, and they most
probably are.  The homes here, though modest, have their wooden doors
thrown open wide, often with some child peeking out with wide eyes at the
happenings going on right outside their front door.  One home in particular
draws attention, with its bright red door, yellow window planter, and 
green curtains with blue stitching.  People wandering by stare in a 
mixture of awe and horror at the display that reminds one of a show only
a Tinker could create.

amazement in anguish at the remains, the youngest of their five children
burying her head in her mother&apos;s skirts.  A small act of charity has taken
place, furnishings and foods have been left by the neighbors, and plans for

nothing has happened however, most people continuing about their days as
though this were nothing different than what they were used to.

This is the poor quarter, where the homes of the less fortunate lie in
a muddy, disorganized heap where hopefully they will go unnoticed by
strangers to the city.

peninsula upon which the great city is built.  The rolling hills are dotted
with small copses of trees that add a dark splash of verdant life to the
flowered meadowlands.  The road within the city widens, its surface paved
securely with fist sized stones that are kept free of garbage and debris.
The walls tower high above, the guardsmen keeping a watchful eye down
at the steady stream of local townspeople and travellers that flow through
the gates.  Buildings line the very edges of the square with their walls,
the burgeoning city full of life and activity.  A small group of peddlers
have set up shop in the very center of the square, selling useless trinkets
at a surprisingly fast rate.

trails continually from the hovels that the local residents call homes.  
The homes are little more than run down one room huts of thatch, or in
the case of the more affluent, a cheap substitute for plaster.  The people
here are often dressed in decent clothing, though with rips and tears and
stains.  There has been some recent at improvement here, as the city has
stepped in to reconstruct some of the homes, making this look like a paradise
compared to the streets further south.

Various rodents scamper by brazenly, and a large dog scrounges in the

Children who should be in the prime of youth beg for money and odd jobs

pervades the surrounding areas.  A small cluster of homes of somewhat solid
construction stands here, though by no means elegant or refined.  City
workmen mill about, taking part in an obvious reconstruction effort to
improve this area of the city.  A small group of hopefuls look at the
new homes with hopeful eyes and smiling faces.  There is even the signs
of a small shop to be built, that will sell the needs of the people at 
reasonable prices, and hopeful stimulate the local economy.

      <roomdescription>Wingard Avenue runs close against the Southern Wall of the city, a small
row of homes lining its northern side.  The ground here is firm, though
still littered with debris from the residents of the area.  The houses look
as though they are mere skeletons of the dwellings of the other sections
of Bandar Eban.  Few people pass by the streets here, their faces turned
down to avoid the gazes of others, their movements sluggish.  Guardsmen
look down from the heights of the walls, their expressions turning to
distaste and disgust as they look down on the impoverished and little
talked about Poor Quarter of Bandar Eban.

here has no consistency whatsoever, and things sink quickly in the oozing
surface.  The air smells of refuse and waste, and large flies buzz noisly
through the air.  This area has been completely and utterly abandoned by
the occupants of the city.  The remains of a home or two on the outskirts
are the only features of note.  A thick fog fills the air, obscuring
vision and casting shadowy shapes about.  Off in the distance there is the
sound of some wino singing loudly and hoarsely.  Suspicious movement 
skitters all over the muck, echoing through the thick, humid air.

placed side by side and right next to the small, dirty homes.  The wood
serves as an attempt to keep out of the mud that swamps the middle of 
the street with its filth.  Children play in the middle of the street in
their rags, as adults look on passively, going about they&apos;re daily 
business.  The homes here are built of stone and mortar and roofed with
thatch.  Looking into the homes reveals the usual one room dwelling with
bare dirt floors and simple, rugged furniture.  The sky here is a dingy
gray and weighs down heavily on the people here.

up and down the street.  A man stands behind a mule here, heavily laden
with some sort of packaged good, pushing and grumbling under his breath
as the mule refuses to budge an inch.  Children laugh as they run about
the scene, pointing grimy fingers, their faces lighting up with mirth if
for but a brief moment.

thresholds of the houses as often as sturdy wooden doors.  Women stand
in their yards, tending small vegetable gardens, though what they will 
eventually reap will be so sickly and small as to be inedible.  Smoke
streams continually from the hearths of the houses, smudging the sky and
blocking out the light of the sun.

Men and women continue to stream by, giving the cause of the commotion
little more than a second glance as they pass.  Homes here rise hardly ten
feet from the ground, their thin wood and stone walls flimsy and lacking
the strength and support needed to handle much weight.  Refuse forms small
piles against the houses on the sides of the street, with ominous and

broken streetlamp, peering down at the homes with beady, shifty eyes.

behind the stable, sometimes mounted and being tamed, sometimes being taught
in the arts of war.  The air is heavy with the pungent odor of horseflesh,
and things less desirable.  Stablehands stand outside, casting warm smiles
at potential customers as they clean the grounds and equipment that are used
for the stable&apos;s daily activities.

Narine, the owner of the yard, has made her &apos;office&apos; against the northern

Homes here are occasional but by no means a commonality, as this area

The most common of these at this location is the sprawling city post.  A
set of wide stairs lie before the large building, solidly constructed
with great wooden beams.  The building is softened by the beautiful flowers
and verdant trees that surround it, giving it a pleasant and approachable
look.  Messengers in the livery of the city dash in and out, sealed
envelopes in hand as they dash off to deliver their charge into the hands
of the person waiting to receive it.

stream through the door with letters and parcels that are to be sent to

prosperous shops, brightly colored and decorated, have been established here.
The most famous of these shops is Ganilla&apos;s Clothing, a large, elaborate
shop that specializes in all types of garments from the mundane to classic
ball gowns, to the silk Domani wraps that are so popular now.  A group of
women huddle about the windows, chittering to themselves as they examine
the display, a group of men that can only be their husbands standing a short
distance behind, their faces drawn and nervous as they try not to look at
their wives.

    <roombasic title="Madame Rigala&apos;s Tart Shoppe" vnum="14175" zone="140">
      <roomdescription>Madame Rigala keeps her shop in a very orderly and meticulous manner.
The western wall is lined with shelves filled with jugs of cider, 
crates of tarts, and a variety of creamy fizzes.  The walls are of
polished wood, giving the room a rustic look, with the scent of pine 
filling the air with its heady scent.  Off to the east, through a large
polished maple archway is the main portion of the shop.  There is an
elegant ash staircase that spirals up to a large outdoor patio above.

      <roomdescription>Sunlight streams in through two large windows giving a majestic view
of the Domani countryside, illuminating the beautiful shop.  Aisle upon
aisle of tarts, ciders, and fizzes are arranged here on intricately 
carved shelves.  Busboys scurry down them, offering a helping hand, and
never letting the stock run low.  Madame Rigala herself stands behind the
counter, ready to help you purchase your selection.

    <roombasic title="The Balcony of Madame Rigala&apos;s Tart Shoppe" vnum="14177" zone="140">
      <roomdescription>Climbing the stairs, you find yourself on top of a large balcony, looking
out south over the thin forest, and the rolling ocean beyond.  Large 
garden tables are strewn about, extending from beneath the billowing silk
canopy and out into the fresh open air.  Fresh ocean breezes and the heady
aroma of fresh flowers permeate the air.  Nearing the balcony one can see
Madame Rigala&apos;s private garden, always in full bloom no matter what time
of year.  One could sit here forever, talking with friends, eating tarts,
and sipping cool refreshing fizzes.

      <roomdescription>This room borders on being uncomfortably warm.  It is moderately sized,
and built to for form and function.  Massive ovens line the walls, almost
constantly baking tarts.  Large vats brew ciders and fizzes to perfections.
Breathing in the mouthwatering air is almost enough to make a person drool
with hunger.  Cooks bustle about, carrying trays of tarts and mixing bowls
of dough.

      <roomdescription>A path of gravel leads from the door of Madame Rigala&apos;s Tart Shoppe to 
her private garden, crunching softly underfoot.  Several white tables and
chairs dot small widenings in the path, where a group of Madame Rigala&apos;s 
favorite patrons may eat their tarts in peace.  Large rosebushes of ever
color flourish everywhere, along with lilies, orchids, tulips and a myriad
of other bright flowers.  The smell is almost intoxicating.  A babbling 
brooke rushes by, spanned by a whitewashed plank bridge, yet another place
to stop and snack, talk, or kiss.

heart of Arad Doman. Below you, you see swaying women walk
by, outshining the men they walk with by far. A stone parapet surrounds
the balcony, and is carved in geometric shapes. To the south is a
curtained off glass door that leads to the Fragrant Lily&apos;s rooms.
