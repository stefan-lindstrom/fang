      <roomdescription>I intend this zone to eventually be a huge ter&apos;angreal.
The entrance to this ter&apos;angreal will be a stone doorway
and, once entered, the player will encounter a series
of Myst-like puzzles. I don&apos;t know what the reward will
be quite yet, but I&apos;ll deal with that as soon as I finish
it.

A large, green stone comprises the base of the left-hand side of

equally large. A blood red keystone caps off the arch, a brass

quilts and blankets. A table beside the bed is littered with books as is the
top of a dresser. An oaken door stands in the northern wall, locked.
The lock seems new.

though also quite new. Aparently the room beyond was used
as a closet once, but now something of great worth is kept
inside.

and must be filled with goose down. The blankets and quilts
seem well-made, if a bit old. They look like they could keep
a person or two warm on a cold, winter night.
