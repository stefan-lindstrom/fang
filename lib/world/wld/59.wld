      <roomdescription>This room is quite spacious, but the dark colors, primarily black,
used in the decor, cause a feeling of oppression and enclosure.
A large bed sits in the center of the room, covered with silk
sheets and down-filled pillows, it looks comfortable, but just
as oppressive as the rest of the room. Paintings of sights and people
from the Age of Legends adorn the walls, while a nightstand next to
the bed contains a crystal vase filled with black roses. There
are six comfortable cushioned chairs off to one side of the
room, a small table and pewter pitcher with accompanying crystal
glass next to each one. There are no windows, no doors, and apparently,
no way out.

      <roomdescription>This room is filled with dark shadows, making
it near impossible to tell if there are any real
walls to this room. There is a single object
here, floating in the center of a narrow beam of
light.

      <roomdescription>&amp;KShadows&amp;n tangle in the corners and dance on the walls, backlit by subtle 
&amp;Ks&amp;wi&amp;Wlv&amp;we&amp;Kr&amp;n sconces though thick and&amp;Kblack&amp;n as visual liquid pitch. &amp;KDarkness&amp;n 
embraces the whole of this room, &amp;Kdarkness&amp;n the color of dried blood and a 
moonless sky, offset by snatches of silver and pewter and some metallic 
&amp;Kblack&amp;n-&amp;Ks&amp;wi&amp;Wlv&amp;we&amp;Kr&amp;n alloy that your eyes have likely never seen before. The floor 
swirls beneath you in patterns of steel and grey swirled into &amp;Kblack&amp;n marble 
and polished into a reflective surface that makes you feel as if to fall 
into yourself endlessly if you look down too long. There are windows, and 
a balcony leading out from double glass doors, however they are draped in 
floor length &amp;Kblack&amp;n linen as curtains which shut out most of the natural 
light. The curtains themselves are trimmed in &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n embroidery that 
looks as if to be some from of writing in a forgotten script. An elaborate, 
majestic bed lies stretched out with it&apos;s black-metal headboard against the 
western most wall. The sleeping space is veiled from your sight by layers 
upon layers of sheer &amp;Kblack&amp;n fabric, generously splayed over the bed and 
cascading down to the floor, though parted in one place for admittance of 
it&apos;s Mistress. A large fireplace takes up much of the eastern wall, it&apos;s 
mantle made of the same curious substance as the bed, and, if you notice,
most of the rest of the furnishings. Bookshelves line vacant walls and 
night stands rest beside the bed, illuminated darkly by the subtle light
of lamps atop them that look to be choking against the inherent &amp;Kblackness&amp;n 
in the room. A desk lies beside a southern door, both shimmering as the 
flickering and soft light reflects off their surfaces. Sharing the wall 
with the headboard of the bed is another door, making up the last of the 
three exits to this disturbing place.

      <roomdescription>Darkness swirls around the room like a deep midnight sky, masking the objects
that lie within this cell.  Faintly recognizable tools have been scattered on
work benches or other surfaces, the smooth, polished stone tables, perfectly
fitting the shape of a human body.  The floor, walls and ceiling, what can be
seen through the enclosing darkness, is also made of an unfamiliar cold stone,
the uniformity of it, giving a vague sense of danger.  The only break in the
identical stonework is the western wall, upon which, large ivy plants, climb
nearly to the shadow enshrouded ceiling.  Racks have been placed along both
sides of the room, barely seen polished implements hanging from their steel
rods.  A large space in the center of the room, allows someone to move about
easily, between the tables, accessing any patient or any device with ease.  A
door leads out of this room, to the east.
