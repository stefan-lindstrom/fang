      <roomdescription>This room is quite spacious, but the dark colors, primarily black,
used in the decor, cause a feeling of oppression and enclosure.
A large bed sits in the center of the room, covered with silk
sheets and down-filled pillows, it looks comfortable, but just
as oppressive as the rest of the room. Paintings of sights and people
from the Age of Legends adorn the walls, while a nightstand next to
the bed contains a crystal vase filled with black roses. There
are six comfortable cushioned chairs off to one side of the
room, a small table and pewter pitcher with accompanying crystal
glass next to each one. There are no windows, no doors, and apparently,
no way out.

      <roomdescription>This room is filled with dark shadows, making
it near impossible to tell if there are any real
walls to this room. There is a single object
here, floating in the center of a narrow beam of
light.

      <roomdescription>A set of heavy, ironclad doors bar the entrance to this forbidden place,
and to set foot in the room behind it is to bathe oneself in &amp;Kdarkness&amp;n.
Light somehow manages existance within the unnatural shadows,
living within the pale &amp;Wi&amp;wl&amp;Kl&amp;kuminat&amp;Ki&amp;wo&amp;Wn&amp;n reflected from a shimmering floor...
which does not really look like it should be shimmering at all. There
is no mirroring image of anything else there, not the black wood
furniture nor the bodies that might walk across it. It may as well be
nothing, except for the eery luminscence that haunts it's endless
depths. Across the room, a set of pale &amp;Kg&amp;wr&amp;Ke&amp;wy&amp;n curtains frames a
windowed door that leads out to a balcony, boasting the peaks
of Shaoyl Guhl beyond. There is a third door as well, this one closer
to the entrance, that is as black as the walls and floor... and there
doesn't seem to be a ceiling. Bookshelves line the walls beside
two dark, silk-covered chairs, and there is a matching set of
smaller tables beside them. A bed lies near one wall, set out a
few feet from it, with it's interior is shrouded by a thick hanging
canopy stitched in soft &amp;kblack&amp;n silks. This room's occupant is
doubtlessly a student of the Shadow, and a long resident here.
Any effects of a personal nature are hidden in the back corner
of the room, veiled by a dark ornamental screen.
