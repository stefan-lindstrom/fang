On the bow of "Victory".~
\c03The bow of the "Victory" is quite dry considering the 
conditions of the \c13sea\c00\c03.  The mist from the swells crashing
into the bow never seems to come past the railing.  The 
smell of the ocean is heavy here and it is quite relaxing.
To the south is the shadow of one of the foreboding ballista
topped battle towers, and high above can be seen sailors
moving through the rigging.

In the shadow of the Foremast "Victory"~
\c03The smell of tarred rope and pine mixes with the salted\c06 ocean
\c03air here in the shadow of the Foremast on the main deck of the 
Victory.  Above some seamen are in the rigging making sure 
everything is secure for the journey.

In the Shadow of the Mainsail~
\c03The shadows of the unfurled sails lie across the deck here and
to either side.  The sound of ropes and wood creaking here is almost
deafening as the ropes come down from the rigging.  Up at the top of
the mainmast, the crows nest can be seen. It looks unmanned from here.

Below the Mizzenmast~
\c03 Below the mizzenmast is some deck that isn't as clean as it should
be, to remedy that there is a deck hand that is now swabbing and scrubbing
the deck to make it as clean as elsewhere on the ship.  The rigging
groans above you as sailors move through it.

Entrance to the Galley "Victory"~
\c03After pushing through the laquered swinging doors the aroma of the galley can
be smelled here.  The tinking together of pots and pans can be heard coming
from below decks.  The food in the galley of this ship is rumored to be the 
best in the whole of the Ever Victorious Army, and if the scent of what is being
prepared has anything to do with the taste, all doubt leaves your mind.
There is a ladder here that leads down to a small dining area for the crew
and the galley beyond it.

Bow Sprit "Victory"~
\c03The bow sprit of this ship juts nearly 4 paces away from the 
bow.  Perched precariously here, you can look down into the 
\c04water\c03 speeding by beneath the ship.  The ship offers no 
protection from the \c13spray\c00\c03 here, and you decide that you have
become wet enough.

When there is word of another ship, or land, a Sul'dam

Below the bow cuts the swells like a heated blade through 
beeswax.
