The Forest Of The Black Hills~
Tall leatherleaf and oak trees close in from all directions, their
roots making the ground a bumpy surface to walk upon. Dried leaves
mix in with ferns and other small forest plants, a few patches of
grass growing where sunlight is able to filter down from the thick
canopy. A road can be seen between trees in the east, otherwise
the only possible direction due to the thick woods is south.

North Of The Black Hills~
A wide dirt road cuts between two hills here, its southern expanse
continuing on under the canopy of a dark forest whose trees grow
menacingly close together. It also winds its way north, most likely
connecting with some farming or logging village outside of the Black
Hills. The woods look impenetrable east off the road, but there
appears to be enough space between trunks on the western side.

Outside Of A Cabin~
The trees of this forest, mostly leatherleaf and oak, tower above, the
suns rays filtering through their green fingers to dot the ground with
light. A warm breeze often blows past, ruffling the short grass and
moist ferns all the way up to a small cabin. The building is squat and
simple, constructed of large oak beams and a well patched brown roof.
Firewood has been stacked beside the stairs leading to the door, an axe
resting against the pile. A garden grows just around the right side of
the cabin, a sign that at least one person lives here.

A Vegetable Garden~
Although this garden is small it grows a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables. Sprouts of carrots and turnips poke out of the ground while
cucumbers, peas, and many other vine plants encircle stakes driven into
the dark earth. The scents of the plants waft through the air, the
strongest smell that of the raspberry bushes up against the side of
the cabin. What looks to be a homemade hoe and hand shovel lie nearby
in the grass. The garden has been placed in an opening of the woods
whose trees cluster quickly back together as if hiding the wilderness
from this man-made structure. Despite the veil of vegetation, however,
the sounds of a running stream can be heard coming from the east.

Inside The Cabin~
The interior of the cabin proves to be about as small as it appears from
the outside. A wood floor has been rather recently laid and covered in
places by what look to be rugs of leather and fur. A wash basin sits up
against the middle of the west wall and beneath a wide, paned window that
looks out at the forest. A small cupboard and hearth rest next to that,
the cooking space appearing neat but well used. The only other furniture
are a bare table with a chair and stool around it, a bed covered with
a patched quilt in the far right corner, and a heavy wood chest up against
that. The walls are sparsely decorated with different typs of furs. All
in all, this cabin appears to be habitated by just one person.

In The Woods~
Once beyond the edge of the forest, the foliage swallows up any view of
the cabin in the west. The tall oak, sourgum, and many other types of trees
reach into the sky to capture sunlight that seldom makes it this far
down. It is cooler here despite a warm breeze blowing through, and obvious
that this forest has not yet been touched by the oppressive heat infecting
the rest of the mainland. The chirps and chatter of many forest creatures
come from all directions, the paths of them passing sometimes visible
in the mossy ground underfoot. A narrow, clear stream winds its way through
this part of the forest, bubbling over smooth rocks set at its bottom.
It seems the origin of this brook lies not far north of here.

The Forest Of The Black Hills~
Trees of mostly oak grow about in thick clumps, their trunks and
the many thorn bushes around them making traveling through this
forest a difficult one. A dirt road seen in the east has fixed the
problem of tackling the Black Hills, but it is unreachable from here
due to the closeness of the trees. They allow movement both north
and south, however.

A Road Through The Forest~
The road looks old and mostly unused, grass poking up through the packed
dirt. However, it is possible to discern any number of animal prints
in the dust, crossing and following the road as it heads both north
and south. The cloudless sky stares down from above, yet despite the
drought invading most of the world, it seems not to have affected this
area much, trees growing so thick together that any step from the road
west is impossible.

The Shore Of A Lake~
Just clear of the edge of a thick-looking forest in the west, a wide
lake sparkles, breezes keeping it rippling at all hours of the day.
It appears fed by a stream that winds in from the west, clear water
tossed over a ridge before it reaches the lake's surface. The sound
of this small waterfall casts a peaceful mood to its shore. On the
eastern side, the lake itself empties into a short swampy area, marking
the beginning of some sort of river that in turn disappears between
two hills. The water of the lake looks cool and inviting, a perfect
way to beat the hot sun's rays.
