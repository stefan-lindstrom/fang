metallic \c10gold\c00 color glittering brightly in the sunlight.  The sounds of
the bustle of the city wafting in with a soft \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00 but fading as other

towards the palace gates and then two roads that lead around the \c07white\c00
stone wall that surrounds the palace grounds.  A few uniformed guards
stand out in front of the palace gate, standing still and looking warily
out over the crowd.  The sounds of hawkers and other vendors waft along
the \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00, perhaps a marketplace is close by.

windows should be.  The broad, \c03paved\c00 street continues towards the north in

faint outline of the \c10Sun Palace\c00 from here.

lined tables along the middle of the room.  On the western wall is a large
fireplace with several chairs arranged around it to make a sitting area
with a small, round, \c03wooden\c00 table in the middle.  Above the mantle of the
\c01f\c03i\c01r\c03e\c01p\c03l\c01a\c03c\c01e\c00, sits a rather large oil painting.  A \c23dark\c00 stained, wooden door
sits right next to the fireplace, leading west out of the common room.  
The north wall also has a door that leads towards the north, resting
behind a bar that lines that entire side of the room with a few feet
between the wall and the bar itself for the innkeeper and serving girls to
walk.  \c03Wooden\c00 shelves are mounted on the wall behind the bar, filled with
different types of spirits that seem to come from all over world.  One
other door also leads out to the east and from the odor that wafts in
whenever the door is open, it is obvious that it leads out towards the
stable.

around as the door opens up into this room.  Several serving girls move in
and out of this room on a regular basis, usually leaving with their arms
full of food for the patrons of the Inn.  One person seems to stand out, a
rather large, \c23dark\c00 haired woman that wears a soft \c02green\c00 dress that is
covered by a pristine \c07white\c00 apron.  She gives out orders to all those
around here without once raising her voice, yet everyone seems to hear her
despite the noise level.  Pots and pans hang from a rack that rests on a
rather large chain, swinging slightly from where it is mounted on the
ceiling.  The chain leads down and seems to be fastened to a hook that
sits on the wall next to the \c03doorway\c00 leading into the pantry.  Another
opening that leads out of the room is a trap door leading down into the
wine cellar.

bed is pushed up against the northwestern corner of the room, a dark \c04blue\c00

food of the bed rests a chest, from the fragrance it can be assumed that
it is made from cedar.  Papers are stacked neatly upon a desk that stands
right beside the bed, an \c04i\c23n\c04k\c23w\c04e\c23l\c04l\c00 and quill sitting next to them upon the

in simpicity.  The only difference is in the color and in the size of the
bed.  To accomodate the cook's girth, a slightly larger bed has been
placed in this room, a crocheted \c07white\c00 comforter resting upon the top.  
Two fluffy pillow sit at the top of the bed, the shams made of the same
crocheted material.  As in the other room, a desk sits next to the bed but
instead of papers resting across the top, there are a number of vials and
containers of all different shapes and sizes.  A mirror has been mounted
on the wall behind the desk, reflecting the room in its \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c07y\c00 depths.

intimacy of this room a stark contrast to the rest of the Inn.  Dark \c04blue\c00
wallpaper covers the walls, intricate scrollings done in sparkling \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00
threads.  One lantern is mounted in each corner of the room, though enough
to provide abundant \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00, they are turned down so only a soft, warm \c07g\c03l\c07o\c03w\c00

room, situated only about a foot or so off the floor.  Large, fluffy
pillows, that are dark \c04blue\c00 to match the wallpaper, sit in several spots
around the table.  Place settings have been set upon the \c03wooden\c00 surface,
along with a large bouquet of \c04f\c05l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c05r\c04s\c00 that are situated in the middle of

      <roomdescription>The door opens up into a tiny room, not even enough room to actually stand
in.  Upon the opposite wall from the entrance are shelves lined with
different \c05c\c06o\c02l\c07o\c02r\c06e\c05d\c00 linens and comforters.  There is no lantern in here, so
the only \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00 that reaches this room if from the lantern mounted upon the

opens.  Two tubs sit on opposite sides of the room, with a large \c03wooden\c00
divider resting in the middle to obscure any vision from one side to the
other.  Each tub is made of stone, or atleast it seems, filled to the brim
with \c06st\c07ea\c06mi\c07ng\c00 \c04w\c06a\c07t\c06e\c04r\c00.  A bench rests to one side of the tub, as well as a
small step to help people in and out of the tub.  Upon the bench rests a
few white towels and vials of various shapes and sizes.

adorning the top.  Small circular tables, made of a \c23dark\c00 stained oak, sit
to either side of the bed.  A wash basin and \c07white\c00, ceramic pitcher rests
upon the top of the one to the left of the bed while the table to the
right holds a small stack of \c03l\c23e\c03a\c23t\c03h\c23e\c03r\c23b\c03o\c23u\c03n\c23d\c00 books.  Resting in the

      <roomdescription>Softly lit lanterns are mounted on the walls all about the room, providing
a warm \c03glow\c00 all around.  The intimate atmosphere of the room is enhanced
even more by the bed.  Centered along the south wall of those room, four
posts rise up from each corner of the bed.  Whispers of pale, gauzy cloth
twirl around each post, from one to the other and again to another, till
all are intertwined with the fabric and it acts as a makeshirt curtain all
around the bed.  A \c07cr\c03e\c07am\c00 colored, crocheted comforter rests upon the top
of the bed, a multitude of large, fluffy pillows sitting at the headboard.
Right next to the bed is a single table, round and covered with the same
gauzy material that is wrapped around the posts.  A small teaset rests
upon the top, the \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00 tray holding a teapot, two cups and saucers, and
a variety of containers for honey, cream and sugar.  On the wall opposite
from the bed, is a small vanity made from a dark, \c01cherry\c00 stained wood.  
The \c23si\c07lv\c23e\c07ry\c00 surface of the mirror reflects back to the bed and the soft
curtains that surround it.  \c23Si\c07lv\c23er\c00 covered combs, brushes and a hand
mirrors rest beside various sized containers.

being big but everything within it also.  The room is obviously made for
an Ogier, if one decided to stay at this Inn, the bed almost taking up the
whole nothern wall of this room.  The frame of the bed seems to be made
from the trunks of rather young \c02t\c23r\c02e\c23e\c02s\c00, just cut and fitted with a mattress
and \c04blue\c00 comforter put upon the slats on the bottom.  One large chair sits
in the corner near the headboard of the bed, high back with large, fluffy,
\c04blue\c00 cushions that make it look atleast comfortable to sit in.

\c03wooden\c00 posts raising from each corner.  Upon the mattress of the bed,
rests a soft looking, \c23g\c07r\c23e\c07y\c00 coverlet with matching shams on the fluffy
pillows.  \c23Black\c00 roses are embroidered upon the comforter, intricatly
designed and spaced out so that it seems each is connected by flowing
\c02vines\c00.  A table rests beside the bed, nothing upon the top of its \c03wooden\c00
surface save for a small book.  The rest of the room is suprisingly
simple.  Only a chair rests in the southern portion of the room, with a
round throw rug on the floor before it.

all bright, cheery colors.  The bed, though on the smallish side, seems to
be comfortable as it is pushed up against the northern wall of this room.
A brightly colored, plaid comforter of \c02greens\c00, \c03yellows\c00 and \c07whites\c00 sits
upon the bed with one side pulled back as if ready for someone to occupy
it.  Two, fluffy pillows rest at the head of the bed and a small,
crocheted comforter resting at the foot for those cold nights.  A chest,
made from \c01c\c03e\c01d\c03a\c01r\c00, rests on the floor at the foot of the bed.  On the top of
the table, that sits next to the bed, is a large bouquet of \c06f\c04l\c11o\c05w\c11e\c04r\c06s\c00.  The
\c06f\c04l\c11o\c05w\c11e\c04r\c06y\c00 aroma filling the room, seeming to add to the cheery atmosphere.

isn't any furniture.  The bed is pushed up so it's nestled in the
northwestern corner of the room, rather small in size with a soft \c07white\c00
comforter upon the top.  A single pillow rests up at the head of the bed,
\c06f\c04l\c11o\c05w\c11e\c04r\c06s\c00 that are embroidered upon the fabric seems to be the only
decoration in this room.  Instead of a table, a small desk sits next to

seen upon the wooden surface, all situated neatly at the top.  The only

various piece of old furniture and paintings are all over the place.  The
dust fills the air and it seems rather stifling in here with no windows.
The sides of the \c03roof\c00 slope down towards the walls of the room, making
standing to any one side a bit difficult for anyone of more than average
height.  In one corner of the room, resting upon the dusty floor, is a
pallet with a small pillow.  The blanket made of corse wool and \c23dark\c02 green\c00
in color.  Perhaps it is here for a traveller that doesn't have enough
money for a regular room or midnight trysts among the employees of the
Inn.

again, fairly closer now, a tall stone wall built all the way around it.
The docks of Cairhien are close, or so hints a faint briny scent wafting
on the wind, and to the north stands a huge building - the Great Tree Inn,
infamous throughout Cairhein for its spectacular structure, and the
service it provides.
