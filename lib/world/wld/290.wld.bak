about outside.  A \c03R\c10i\c03s\c10i\c03n\c10g\c03 S\c10u\c03n\c00 in encrusted into the twin doors, the
metallic \c10gold\c00 color glittering brightly in the sunlight.  The sounds of
the bustle of the city wafting in with a soft \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00 but fading as other
sounds begin to become more obvious.

several guards in uniform standing around.  A wide, smooth \c23s\c07t\c23o\c07n\c23e\c00 ramp

towards the palace gates and then two roads that lead around the \c07white\c00
stone wall that surrounds the palace grounds.  A few uniformed guards
stand out in front of the palace gate, standing still and looking warily
out over the crowd.  The sounds of hawkers and other vendors waft along
the \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00, perhaps a marketplace is close by.

the Cairhien, a faint briny scent wafting in on a \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00 from that

both sides.  The buildings on either side of the street are all made of

city was built on.  The outline of the \c10Palace\c00 looms closer as the road

forward into the city.  Off to the right side is a squat building made of

windows should be.  The broad, \c03paved\c00 street continues towards the north in
a perfect straight line, anyone tall enough might even be able to see the
faint outline of the \c10Sun Palace\c00 from here.

lined tables along the middle of the room.  On the western wall is a large
fireplace with several chairs arranged around it to make a sitting area
with a small, round, \c03wooden\c00 table in the middle.  Above the mantle of the
\c01f\c03i\c01r\c03e\c01p\c03l\c01a\c03c\c01e\c00, sits a rather large oil painting.  A \c23dark\c00 stained, wooden door
sits right next to the fireplace, leading west out of the common room.  
The north wall also has a door that leads towards the north, resting
behind a bar that lines that entire side of the room with a few feet
between the wall and the bar itself for the innkeeper and serving girls to
walk.  \c03Wooden\c00 shelves are mounted on the wall behind the bar, filled with
different types of spirits that seem to come from all over world.  One
other door also leads out to the east and from the odor that wafts in
whenever the door is open, it is obvious that it leads out towards the
stable.

around as the door opens up into this room.  Several serving girls move in
and out of this room on a regular basis, usually leaving with their arms
full of food for the patrons of the Inn.  One person seems to stand out, a
rather large, \c23dark\c00 haired woman that wears a soft \c02green\c00 dress that is
covered by a pristine \c07white\c00 apron.  She gives out orders to all those
around here without once raising her voice, yet everyone seems to hear her
despite the noise level.  Pots and pans hang from a rack that rests on a
rather large chain, swinging slightly from where it is mounted on the
ceiling.  The chain leads down and seems to be fastened to a hook that
sits on the wall next to the \c03doorway\c00 leading into the pantry.  Another
opening that leads out of the room is a trap door leading down into the
wine cellar.

bed is pushed up against the northwestern corner of the room, a dark \c04blue\c00
coverlet adorning the top with a lone pillow resting at the head.  At the
food of the bed rests a chest, from the fragrance it can be assumed that
it is made from cedar.  Papers are stacked neatly upon a desk that stands
right beside the bed, an \c04i\c23n\c04k\c23w\c04e\c23l\c04l\c00 and quill sitting next to them upon the

placed in this room, a crocheted \c07white\c00 comforter resting upon the top.  
Two fluffy pillow sit at the top of the bed, the shams made of the same
crocheted material.  As in the other room, a desk sits next to the bed but
instead of papers resting across the top, there are a number of vials and
containers of all different shapes and sizes.  A mirror has been mounted
on the wall behind the desk, reflecting the room in its \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c07y\c00 depths.

intimacy of this room a stark contrast to the rest of the Inn.  Dark \c04blue\c00
wallpaper covers the walls, intricate scrollings done in sparkling \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00
threads.  One lantern is mounted in each corner of the room, though enough
to provide abundant \c03li\c07g\c03ht\c00, they are turned down so only a soft, warm \c07g\c03l\c07o\c03w\c00
fills the area.  A long, rectangular table rests in the middle of the
room, situated only about a foot or so off the floor.  Large, fluffy
pillows, that are dark \c04blue\c00 to match the wallpaper, sit in several spots
around the table.  Place settings have been set upon the \c03wooden\c00 surface,
along with a large bouquet of \c04f\c05l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c05r\c04s\c00 that are situated in the middle of

\c23shadows\c00 upon the wall and all three doors that lead out of this hallway.
The one that leads farther to the west seems to have \c06steam\c00 rising up from
under the door, suggesting that perhaps that is the bathing area for this
inn.  The other two doors lead north and south from here, faint designs
etched into the wooden surface of each.

doors lead into the inn itself and another, double doors, lead out onto a
side street in the city of Cairhien.  The wall nearest to the door leading
into the inn has several dozen \c23st\c07ee\c23l\c00 hooks mounted upon it, curry brushes,
bridles and reins hanging with with their metal accents \c07s\c06p\c07a\c06r\c07k\c06l\c07i\c06n\c07g\c00 faint

      <roomdescription>This is a large, wide room, the floor tiled in blue and white and the walls 
painted in a soft blue.  Just to the west of the door into the building
from the street is a large counter of rich, dark wood.  Behind it is a 
curious construction full of cubbyholes, each one labelled with a name. 
Some of the cubbyholes have slips of paper, or envelopes, in them.  In the
northwest corner of  the room is a staircase leading up to the second story,
and along the eastern wall is a small sitting area with several padded 
chairs and a small table holding a few books.  There are colourful 
tapestries depicting battle scenes at regular intervals along the walls.

clacking against each other reaches your ears.  The ground is paved in
slightly bumpy cobblestones.  To each side of the entrance to the
building is a bench of smooth grey stone that almost blends into the
stone of the walls.  Windows look out over the courtyard from the second
floor of the building and also from the reception area to the north.

This path leads to a solid wooden door, which matches the others in the

in.  Inside the fence the ground is hard-packed dirt.  Several large boulders
are embedded into the dirt, and young trees provide some shade.  In the
southwest corner the ground slopes upward into a large mound which is
perhaps five feet high at the wall.

majority of the western wall  is taken up with large windows that look out
onto the courtyard.  Though the door to the courtyard is also on this wall.
The  eastern wall also has a number of windows and  interspersed
between them, a myriad of ceremonial weapons are mounted.   The 
northern and southern walls   have weapons racks mounted upon them.
The southern wall is the home of wooden practise lathes, while the racks
on the northern wall hold a large variety of steel swords.

glass hangs on the west wall between two windows which look out over 
the street.

      <roomdescription>Entering the Masters office the first thing your eyes fall to is a large  
desk, made from a deep rich wood,  it has been polished until it gleams in 
the sunlight. Sitting on the carpeted floor beside the desk is a large carved 
wooden box in the same rich toned wood.  There are a few papers on
the desk, and a quill and inkpot, otherwise it is bare.  Behind the desk is 
a large, comfortable looking armchair.  It is upholstered in a dark wine 
coloured leather, and the wood is the same gleaming dark rich tone 
as the desk.  The walls are painted the same muted white as the hallways, 
and the dark blue carpet from the hallway runs into this room as well.   The 
walls are bare except for a dark wooden rack  on the wall behind the desk, 
where a perfectly polished katana rests.  A large window, with a window 
seat looks out over the courtyard,  and there is a tall bookshelf on the 
east wall right near the door to the hallway.  On the southern wall hangs 
a tapestry of a tall man, wearing full body armour carrying a large sword 
in his right hand.  Beside the tapestry is another large wooden door.

      <roomdescription>This room seems out of place compared to the sober, elegant tone of
the rest of the building. The walls are draped with brightly colored
draping, giving the room an almost playful air. A large, finely made
oaken bed sits under a large window opposite the door. Looking to the 
right, you see a small wardrobe closet sitting next to a washstand. The
mirror over the washstand reflects the sunlight streaming from the window 
into the rest of the room.   There are two doors in the room,  one on the 
north wall and another on the east wall.

      <roomdescription>This large room is dominated by a massive rectangular table.  The table 
is surrounded by a dozen hard wooden chairs.  The floor is bare hardwood,
and the walls are covered in white panelling which is flecked randomly with
light blue.   A large map of the continent is tacked to the wall  behind the
head of the table.  The windows on the north wall look out over the 
courtyard, while the windows on the south look out into the city.  There
are two large wooden doors in the room, one in the northwest corner 
and the other in the northeast corner.
