      <roomdescription>This large loft is quiet and dominated by the presence of a series of book
shelves on the wooden walls here.  A great number of well kept books and
notebooks are placed on them in no recognizable order, along with several
musical instruments hanging from the ceiling or carefully placed on the
floor in thick leather cases.  An enormous window with painted wooden
shutters spans most of one wall and allows plenty of light in the room,
while a few tall candlestands in the corners take care of that during the
night.  Pictures of places far away, grey cities on green hills, stone
walls of great forts, and bright halls of beauty capture the eye.  Thick
and richly colored rugs cover the wooden floor.  A large desk sets near
the window and is covered in sketches and small drawings.  The rest of the
furniture is simple but elegant, with clean lines that do not detract from
the paintings on the walls.

      <roomdescription>This is one of the oddest bathrooms in Caemlyn.  Covering part of the
floor in front of door are a scattering of empty bottles of ale.  There is
a very large, battered tub here that has seen better days along with a peg
from which a red and gold robe is hunged along with a collection of wide
brimmed, always black hats.  There is a large boxwood wing-door on one of
the walls that leads to a wardrobe, and is inset with two polished
mirrors.  There is the unmistakable mixed odor of soap, leather and
alcohol here, dominating the room.

      <roomdescription>The closet is an actual room, a small room, but a place too large to be
called a wardrobe by any rational person.  There are several shelves on
which clothes are stored, from simple pants, breeches, and silken shirts
neatly folded and capes of various colors and sizes, but also an
apparently huge collection of all sorts of wide brimmed hats and a number
of robes and spiffy looking belts as well.  On the higher shelves are
placed some towels, and there are some odd oversized sleeves on a few of
those shirts along with a collection of ready made bandages right next to
the door for quick and easy access.

      <roomdescription>   You are in a rather large, comfortable room. Two large desks occupy the
corners next to the large window which allows light to be shed here during the
day, and there are several long white wax candles on the wall for the rest of
the time. A green velvet bulletin board is placed against one of the walls,
with quite a number of small notes and parchments attached to it.
   There are chairs here you can use to rest, along with a few lower quality
musical instruments to practice with while you are here, just in case you forgot
to bring your own. The accoustics of the room seem to have been carefully studied
for the sound is carried well and loses a very small portion of its quality.

resting a while, and there are servants with special orders to bring
drinks and serve those who are allowed in here.

contain potatoes, turnips, radishes and other root plants used in the
cooking.  Some of the wooden barrels contain ale and others contain salted
meat.  There are many footprints in the dirt, mostly of boots, many of
which seem to go no further than the center of the cellar.  The center of
the cellar is free of any obstructions, which seems to be an awful waste
of space.  Off to the northern side of the cellar is a hole in the floor,
covered by a grate.

from where you are standing.  The sheer intensity of the sweet, fresh smell
could probably drive even a person just satiated from a large meal in search of
their origins.  The wooden signs above the shops are well painted, and the
choice of colors was careful to draw attention, as though the sign were needed
at all.  Many other shops have their doors open on this wide road, certainly
one of the widest and busiest in all of Caemlyn.  It serves as a connecting
street between this and almost all other parts of the city, even passing next
to the Origan gate that marks the entrance to the inner city.

seems to be coming from somewhere to the west. This is one of the widest and
longest roads in Caemlyn, curving in an oval around the road that traverses
straight through the distance between the east and west gates. Along its
elliptical path, it curves through almost the entirety of the city of Caemlyn,
and intersects streets that can traverse the rest of the city which the circle
does not touch. For this reason it is quite a busy street, filled with people
of all kinds, from locals to visitors and beggars to nobles. A young-looking
peddler paces on one side of the walk here, shouting his wares anxiously.

      <roomdescription>Just to the west the road curves southward, and branches off with a small
side street. This fairly busy street is so named because it curves around
a rather large park near the inner city of Caemlyn. Paved with white stone
and polished smooth for an easy ride on cart and wagon goers, it is also
patrolled very regularly by members of the Andoran Royal Guard, soldiers
who make peace their job, and take that job very seriously. A small child
toddles down the side of the street here, hand firmly clutching the hand
of his mother, as he tries valiantly to walk all the way to the nearby
entrance to the park without falling.

double-edged blades at the soldiers' sides attract a few second glances,
though less than if the blades were at someone else's belt: people here feel
reassured when the weapons belong to the Royal Guard.

into the oval plaza situated in front of the Royal Palace of Andor. Though
it is considerably more narrow than the street which it meets eastward, it

It is also quite busy, with not only men and women rushing here or there on

or a show, and many wandering peddlers who circle this neighborhood just
southwest of the inner city all day long.

their parents' hands excitedly as they watch the gleeman play, then
seem to lose interest the younger they are once he stops playing and
begins telling a story, a tale of villains and heroes that seem to jump

Not everyone stops to look, though; some pass by here as though seeing
a gleeman were an everyday occurrence, and perhaps it is quite common
here in Caemlyn. A few peddlers cry their wares, but are quickly silenced
by annoying looks and gestures from those gathered to hear the gleeman's

      <roomdescription>The wide lane here crosses a slightly smaller street which appears to
widen a bit to the north.  This intersection is bustling with peddlers and
vendors crying their wares, merchants conducting their business both
inside and outside of the inn which rises up from the southeast corner to
cover almost the entire block, and is several stories high.  \c03The Golden
Bowl\c00 is one of the oldest inns in Caemlyn, and is in its second
reconstruction; it remains quite popular among locals and visitors alike.
Above the stone steps to the inn's front door and the large oak door which
leads to the first common room, a wooden sign hangs from a more
lightly-finished wooden pole and proclaims the inn to be open for
business.

sound of too many people whispering at the same time. The white noise
is actually quite loud, coming from the crowd of people gathered near
the side of the street. As the people in the crowd shift, you can see
flashes of bright color. Here, the street continues east and west in
a wide straight line. Walking through here early in the morning, the
street sweepers demonstrate just how dedicated the inhabitants of the
city are to Caemlyn. At the beginning of the day the white cobblestones
match the brilliant white stone of the city wall, swept and washed to
their original whiteness.

some distance from here, the immaculate stonework of their walls and
the gracious curves of their towers distinguishing them from the rest
of the buildings near them. Some of them look like the mansions of the
noble houses of Andor, though others look to be merely large houses by
comparison, and are most likely the residences of wealthy citizens. The
Queen's guards are here in larger numbers than in parts of the outer
city, all of them intent on maintaining the peace in the area. Some of
the nearest estates are accessible via small lanes which curve up to
large sets of gates fringed by lush green plants.

slightly lesser width, albeit still beautifully paved with smooth white
cobblestones which have been fairly evenly worn through the years and
provide an even ride for horses and coaches as they pass through the
outskirts of the inner city. On the corner, a young peddler cries the
necessity and the value of his merchandise, attracting few pauses in
the passings of the city inhabitants, who rush on about their business,
by now quite used to the cries of merchants and vendors. After a while,
the sales pitches become a vague nagging sound on the outskirts of one's
memory, though the cries in the outer part of the city are a bit louder
and a bit more insistent.

      <roomdescription>Here a wide, tall stone arch makes a gate between the inner city of Caemlyn
and the much older and larger outer city. The inner city was built by Ogiers
many years ago, and much of it appears to be still intact. The wide stone
arch is slightly darker than the stone wall around the inner city, though
not dark enough to make the difference unattractive. There are a few children
playing with stones on the side of the road, their merry voices reaching your
ears as you pass them by. The traffic in and out of the gate is of a fair
density, though during the evening it thins out somewhat.

to be an Inn or Tavern.  The lane slopes upwards to the south, curving
just slightly, the hot sun of day reflecting off the bright white stone
paving of the street and making the whole street seem brighter.  A few
children run past down the middle of this lane, indicating that it is
normally not very busy at any given time.  In the middle of the street, a
vendor waves an iron kettle and a copper stewpot about as he shouts their
amazing qualities and their lasting life.  From time to time one of the
people passing by here stops to make a purchase from him, and the shouting
ceases for but a brief moment.  He glances territorially about him all
through his cries, as though warning other peddlers away.

gruff piece of advice. There is a fair amount of traffic, most travelling
between Caemlyn and Lugard, though some have come from, or are going to,
more remote destinations to the south and west. A number of \c01Queen's

the natural landscape of the soil, and this particular area is on the
slope of a fairly steep hill that rises upward to the south, peaking just
a bit further in that direction.  This affords a spectacular view of much
of the city of Caemlyn.  Looking in any direction, a person can see large,
impressive mansions in the distance.  A few of them are clumped in groups
here and there, but many of them stand in their own sections of the city,
for the most part alone in their magnificence.  Tall stone towers rise
above the rest of the roofs, punctuating the walls of the city.  The
guards on the towers almost match the size of the people that can be seen
in the streets who are farthest away they look the size of small insects.

sounds of the inner city are fairly faint, an indication that a calmer
section of the city begins here and continues to the south, away from
Palace Circle and the \c01Andoran Royal Palace\c00. Aside from the fair amount
of anxiety that pervades the city like the unrelenting heat wave that
causes the feeling, the inhabitants of this city seem rather comfortable
with each other. Perhaps that comfort is derived from the safe atmosphere
that the numerous Queen's Guards wandering through the city provide, or
perhaps it is a learned quality inherent to a group of citizens satisfied
with their lives and their rulers. Whatever the reason, it is there, an
almost undetectable feeling of hospitality that is usually absent in a
large city such as this.

side of the street here, in front of a musician of sorts who is sitting
with his back against a building, playing a tune on a large harp. The harp
is more eye-catching than the man, made of \c03brass\c00 or \c10gold\c00 and laced with
\c07s\c00i\c07l\c00v\c07e\c00r leaf in the shape of \c01roses\c00 growing in spirals up the stem. It must
be quite valuable, though certainly far too heavy for any one person to
steal without being noticed or caught. The man caresses his harp as though
it is his most prized possession, and perhaps his only possession, for his
clothes look rather ragged. His apparel does not seem to match the rest of
the scene, however, as the rather large and growing number of coins in his
plate is probably a normal amount of earnings for such a day and such music.

      <roomdescription>Painted in concentric circles of \c11blue\c00 and \c03yellow\c00 that have faded somewhat
with time and footsteps, the stone on this section of the street apparently
was designed to attract the attention of the passerby. The northernmost
stone on the ground has been replaced by a mosaic of brightly painted \c14t\c13i\c10l\c08e\c09s\c00,
Arranged in some checkerboard pattern that is quite difficult to make out.
The brighter colors are arranged in what could be an arrow or a pointer,
directing the observer to the north, where a faint sound of running water
can be heard and a glance through the wrought iron gates and up the shaded
street reveals a series of smaller shops on both sides of the road leading
up to a stone fountain.

      <roomdescription>Over the roof of a small building to the north you can see the trunk
of a tall tree, stretching toward the sky with its dark green leaves.
It is not alone in its reach; several trees line what looks like a
small path in a park to the northwest. Strangely, even during those
rare moments where there is no breeze to be felt, you can still hear
one: or at least there is a constant sound something like a breeze as
it would pass your ears. Perhaps it is the sound of rushing water, as
one would hear it from a distance. This street continues to the east
and west, a lane paved with smooth stones which, while brightly painted
a bit to the west, are plain white here. Small shops line the lane, all
of them with signs outside their doors proclaiming them open.

      <roomdescription>This street is quite busy during the day, as crowds of people come and
go, most of them here to visit the small park to the northwest. The park
is a kind of refuge from the heat wave that has descended on the world
lately; it provides shade and a cool breeze where elsewhere there is only
the harsh beating of the sun coupled with the hot, dry, biting wind. The
smell of wet grass blows on one of the breezes through the area and then
is gone, an ephemeral reminder of the weather that once was. While there
are dozens of people passing through here at any given point, the families
and the couples who come here during the day are nowhere to be found after
the sun has set and the night has begun.

      <roomdescription>The road turns a corner, the shape of the white stones paving the lane
changing just slightly to adapt to the curve. From here the towering
outer city wall can be seen easily, as it is quite close. Even when at
a fair distance from the wall the detail is astounding; patterns of
nature within patterns, vines and flowers curling around trees and the
scenes of animals and plants that seem to move with their own energy,
are only a few of the things easily distinguishable in the carvings of
the Ogier stonemasons who built the wall so long ago. Even peddlers and
soldiers who see the wall every day stop to marvel at the work that can
no longer be found anywhere in the world but Caemlyn and a few other
cities, now renowned throughout the world for their beauty and prestige.

its newly tiled terra-cotta roof nestled behind a high stone wall
and ornamental iron gate. The wooden front door of the manor 
is arched, and has a brass lily shaped knob and matching knocker.
The front lawn is neat with a thick border of flowers, mostly
lilies and roses that edge the manor. A number of trees,
including nut and fruit trees are scattered about the front and
wander down the sides and back of the manor, suggesting an orchard.

warmth.  A fireplace lies in a corner, a slow \c01fire\c00 burns to provide the
heat required for the travelworn citizens, while a few young, attractive
maids run around to take care of orders from the paying customers.  There
are two windows here, both of them closed most of the time, and that does
nothing to keep a slight smell of fresh ale from the air, a scent to
caress the nostrils gently and makes sitting all the more comfortable.  A
few large wooden tables are kept polished and clean at all times, and
there seem to be enough chairs lying around to accomodate great numbers of

excellent \c03lighting\c00 to the area as well as the \c10candles\c00 on the tables.

corner is a stone \c01fireplace\c00 which also provides light as well as warmth in
the \c04winter\c00.  In the warmer seasons, \c10candles\c00 are put in the \c01fireplace\c00
giving the room a cozy ambience.  There are a series of \c04paintings\c00 on the
walls, images of cities far away from here, from the Shining Walls to the
Stone of Tear, and to the port of Illian, offering an almost window-like
view to the world that even the city of Caemlyn is but a very small part
of.  Each of these \c04paintings\c00 have been completed by local Andoran artists.

come up with.  There are \c03tables\c00 lying around here, most of them stained

other, although the \c08maids\c00 seem to find their way easily enough among the
\c03tables\c00 if just due to some sort of instinct.  There is a large \c04window\c00

    <roombasic title="The Orchard Bridge" vnum="30084" zone="300">
      <roomdescription>This wooden bridge rises to make a nice arch over the stream below.  The
apples are often washed in the stream or in the pond.  Both sources of
water are used to keep the apple trees watered as needed.  The bridge is
nice and wide such that a cart can easily pass across without difficulty
but it is not wide enough to accomodate two carts side by side.  Standing
atop of the bridge it is very lovely to look out over the orchard.  At
night lanterns are some times hung along the rails of the bridge so the
carts can make their way out in the dark.

      <roomdescription>This is the section of the orchard where the newest apple trees have been
planted in order to expand the orchard.  Its also the section of the
orchard that requires the most attention, although, it will be years
before these new trees will bear apples that can be picked.  There are
some small wooden ladders and step stools for pruning and trimming the
trees.  The orchard pond lies here as well and is often used to wash
apples in.

      <roomdescription>This is a rather dark room usually filled with smoke and smelling of
strong drink and probably sweat from those who are loseing at the gaming
tables.  There are a number of wooden tables about this room with a
cluster of straight-backed chairs around them.  There are usually dice
games and various card games being played at these tables.  The walls are
bare and the floors are made of wood and just as bare as the walls.  
Often someone will stand guard at the door to make sure no one enters who
isn't supposed to enter, of course, this wouldn't included the Queen's
Guards.  Small fortunes are won and lost in this room and it is visited by
all manner of people, long as they've money to play at the tables.

large queen sized \c04bed\c00 and a \c12wardrobe\c00 covering the better part of one of

the eye and the \c13wallpaper\c00 seems to have been chosen to fit that particular
theme.  The \c14ceiling\c00 has been carefully painted, depicting scenes of a
\c04peaceful \c23mountain\c00 covered in \c14snow\c00, the colouring almost perfect to give
the room a sense of \c04freedom\c00 and it somehow seems larger than it actually
is, as if it was all made out of some kind of soft \c14rock\c00.
