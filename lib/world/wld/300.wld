      <roomdescription>You find yourself in a large loft, dominated by the presence of a series of
book shelves on the wooden walls here. A great number of well kept books
and notebooks are placed on them in no recognizable order, along with several
musical instruments hanging from the ceiling or carefully placed on the floor 
in thick leather cases.
An enormous window with painted wooden shutters spans most of one wall and
allows plenty of light in the room, while a few tall candlestands in the corners
take care of that during the night.  Pictures of places far away, grey cities
on green hills, stone walls of great forts, and bright halls of beauty capture 
your eye. Thick and richly colored rugs cover the wooden floor.  A large desk 
sets near the window and is covered in sketches and small drawings.  The rest 
of the furniture  is simple but elegant, with clean lines that do not detract 
from the paintings on the walls.

    <roombasic title="The bathroom" vnum="30001" zone="300">
      <roomdescription>   You find yourself in one of the oddest bathrooms in Caemlyn, walking in as
you avoid the empty bottles of ale that cover part of the floor in front of 
door. There is a very large, battered tub here that has seen better days along
with a peg from which a red and gold robe is hanged along with a collection
of wide brimmed, always black hats.
   There is a large wooden wingdoor on one of the walls that seems to lead to
some kind of closet or wardrobe, and whose entire surface is covered by two
polished glass mirrors. There is the unmistakable mixed odor of soap and 
alcohol here, dominating the air of the room.

      <roomdescription>   You enter the closet and find yourself in an actual room, a place too large
to be called a wardrobe by any rational man - or be used thus. There are
several shelves on which clothes are stored, from simple pants and breeches,
silken shirts neatly folded and capes of various colors and sizes, but also
an apparently huge collection of all sorts of wide brimmed hats and a
number or robes as well.
   On the higher shelves are placed some towels, and you can see some odd
oversized sleeves on some of those shirts along with a collection of ready
made bandages right next to the door handy for easier and quicker access.

      <roomdescription>   You are in a rather large, comfortable room. Two large desks occupy the
corners next to the large window which allows light to be shed here during the
day, and there are several long white wax candles on the wall for the rest of
the time. A green velvet bulletin board is placed against one of the walls,
with quite a number of small notes and parchments attached to it.
   There are chairs here you can use to rest, along with a few lower quality
musical instruments to practice with while you are here, just in case you forgot
to bring your own. The accoustics of the room seem to have been carefully studied
for the sound is carried well and loses a very small portion of its quality.

   There is a couch here if you want to rest for
a while, and there are servants with special orders
to bring drinks and serve those who are allowed in

choice of colors was careful to draw attention, as though the sign were needed
at all.  Many other shops have their doors open on this wide road, certainly
one of the widest and busiest in all of Caemlyn.  It serves as a connecting
street between this and almost all other parts of the city, even passing next
to the Origan gate that marks the entrance to the inner city.

seems to be coming from somewhere to the west. This is one of the widest and
longest roads in Caemlyn, curving in an oval around the road that traverses
straight through the distance between the east and west gates. Along its
elliptical path, it curves through almost the entirety of the city of Caemlyn,
and intersects streets that can traverse the rest of the city which the circle
does not touch. For this reason it is quite a busy street, filled with people
of all kinds, from locals to visitors and beggars to nobles. A young-looking
peddler paces on one side of the walk here, shouting his wares anxiously.

side street. This fairly busy street is so named because it curves around
a rather large park near the inner city of Caemlyn. Paved with white stone
and polished smooth for an easy ride on cart and wagon goers, it is also
patrolled very regularly by members of the Andoran Royal Guard, soldiers
who make peace their job, and take that job very seriously. A small child
toddles down the side of the street here, hand firmly clutching the hand
of his mother, as he tries valiantly to walk all the way to the nearby
entrance to the park without falling.

It is also quite busy, with not only men and women rushing here or there on

or a show, and many wandering peddlers who circle this neighborhood just
southwest of the inner city all day long.

seem to lose interest the younger they are once he stops playing and
begins telling a story, a tale of villains and heroes that seem to jump

Not everyone stops to look, though; some pass by here as though seeing
a gleeman were an everyday occurrence, and perhaps it is quite common
here in Caemlyn. A few peddlers cry their wares, but are quickly silenced
by annoying looks and gestures from those gathered to hear the gleeman&apos;s
tale.

      <roomdescription>The street begins to narrow just a bit as it meets with a street of a
slightly lesser width, albeit still beautifully paved with smooth white
cobblestones which have been fairly evenly worn through the years and
provide an even ride for horses and coaches as they pass through the
outskirts of the inner city. On the corner, a young peddler cries the
necessity and the value of his merchandise, attracting few pauses in
the passings of the city inhabitants, who rush on about their business,
by now quite used to the cries of merchants and vendors. After a while,
the sales pitches become a vague nagging sound on the outskirts of one&apos;s
memory, though the cries in the outer part of the city are a bit louder
and a bit more insistent.

      <roomdescription>Here a wide, tall stone arch makes a gate between the inner city of Caemlyn
and the much older and larger outer city. The inner city was built by Ogiers
many years ago, and much of it appears to be still intact. The wide stone
arch is slightly darker than the stone wall around the inner city, though
not dark enough to make the difference unattractive. There are a few children
playing with stones on the side of the road, their merry voices reaching your
ears as you pass them by. The traffic in and out of the gate is of a fair
density, though during the evening it thins out somewhat.

waves an iron kettle and a copper stewpot about as he shouts their
amazing qualities and their lasting life. From time to time one of
the people passing by here stops to make a purchase from him, and
the shouting ceases for but a brief moment. He glances territorially
about him all through his cries, as though warning other peddlers

gruff piece of advice. There is a fair amount of traffic, most travelling
between Caemlyn and Lugard, though some have come from, or are going to,
more remote destinations to the south and west. A number of \c01Queen&apos;s

through here without giving the neighborhood a moment&apos;s notice. The

dampened somewhat by the barrier of buildings and trees between you.

the natural landscape of the soil, and you are standing on the slope of
a fairly steep hill that rises upward to the south, peaking just a bit
further in that direction. This affords a spectacular view of much of the
city of Caemlyn. Looking in any direction, you can see large, impressive
mansions in the distance. A few of them are clumped in groups here and
there, but many of them stand in their own sections of the city, for the
most part alone in their magnificence. Tall stone towers rise above the
rest of the roofs, punctuating the walls of the city. The guards on the
towers almost match the size of the people you can see in the streets
who are farthest from you; they look the size of small insects.

sounds of the inner city are fairly faint, an indication that a calmer
section of the city begins here and continues to the south, away from
Palace Circle and the \c01Andoran Royal Palace\c00. Aside from the fair amount
of anxiety that pervades the city like the unrelenting heat wave that
causes the feeling, the inhabitants of this city seem rather comfortable
with each other. Perhaps that comfort is derived from the safe atmosphere
that the numerous Queen&apos;s Guards wandering through the city provide, or
perhaps it is a learned quality inherent to a group of citizens satisfied
with their lives and their rulers. Whatever the reason, it is there, an
almost undetectable feeling of hospitality that is usually absent in a
large city such as this.

side of the street here, in front of a musician of sorts who is sitting
with his back against a building, playing a tune on a large harp. The harp
is more eye-catching than the man, made of \c03brass\c00 or \c10gold\c00 and laced with
\c07s\c00i\c07l\c00v\c07e\c00r leaf in the shape of \c01roses\c00 growing in spirals up the stem. It must
be quite valuable, though certainly far too heavy for any one person to
steal without being noticed or caught. The man caresses his harp as though
it is his most prized possession, and perhaps his only possession, for his
clothes look rather ragged. His apparel does not seem to match the rest of
the scene, however, as the rather large and growing number of coins in his
plate is probably a normal amount of earnings for such a day and such music.

of a tall tree, stretching toward the sky with its dark green leaves.
It is not alone in its reach; several trees line what looks like a
small path in a park to the northwest. Strangely, even during those
rare moments where there is no breeze to be felt, you can still hear
one: or at least there is a constant sound something like a breeze as
it would pass your ears. Perhaps it is the sound of rushing water, as
one would hear it from a distance. This street continues to the east
and west, a lane paved with smooth stones which, while brightly painted
a bit to the west, are plain white here. Small shops line the lane, all
of them with signs outside their doors proclaiming them open.

the harsh beating of the sun coupled with the hot, dry, biting wind. The

      <roomdescription>The road turns a corner, the shape of the white stones paving the lane
changing just slightly to adapt to the curve. From here the towering
outer city wall can be seen easily, as it is quite close. Even when at
a fair distance from the wall the detail is astounding; patterns of
nature within patterns, vines and flowers curling around trees and the
scenes of animals and plants that seem to move with their own energy,
are only a few of the things easily distinguishable in the carvings of
the Ogier stonemasons who built the wall so long ago. Even peddlers and
soldiers who see the wall every day stop to marvel at the work that can
no longer be found anywhere in the world but Caemlyn and a few other
cities, now renowned throughout the world for their beauty and prestige.

      <roomdescription>\c00   The common room of &apos;Al&apos;cair Dal, the Golden Bowl for most, is an image of
warmth. A fireplace  lies in a corner, a slow \c01fire\c00 burns to provide the
heat required for the travelworn citizens, while a few young, attractive maids
run around to take care of orders from the paying customers.
   There are two windows here, both of them closed most of the time, and that
does nothing to keep a slight smell of fresh ale from the air, a scent to
caress your nostrils gently and make you feel comfortable sitting. A few large
wooden tables are kept polished and clean at all times, and there seem to be
enough chairs lying around to accomodate great numbers of people if at all
necessairy.

no windows or other exits than the one you just came from, although the
presence of several torches on the walls provide excellent \c10lighting\c00 to the area
around you.  There are four very large tables, the oak wood carefully polished
and waxed, the chairs look particularly comfortable and inviting, and the large
fireplace in the corner offers the \c01heat\c00 necessairy to add to the general
effect.  The entire place looks designed to offer large numbers of people used
to a certain amount of class in their surroundings.  \c00 You can see a series of
paintings on the walls, images of cities far away from here, from the \c14Shining
Walls\c00 to the Stone of Tear, and to the port of Illian, offering an almost
window-like view to the world that even the city of Caemlyn is but a very small
part of.

the owners of the establishment could come up with.
\c00   There are more tables lying around here, most of them stained with what
appears to be weeks worth of ale spilled on the wood, the glasses clean
enough even if filled with the weaker, cheaper varieties of the alcoholic
beverages. There are some candles to shed light to the room, barely enough
to allow anyone to see from one of its sides to the other, although the maids
seem to find their way easily enough among the tables if just due to some
sort of instinct.
\c00   There is a large window here, open most of the day and all of the night
to at least allow some small amounds of fresh air to accidentally invade the
atmosphere of this particular place.

of food and freshly baked bread reaches your nostrils almost as you enter.
The tables are clean enough to attract the middle class citizens of Caemlyn in
here, while the quality and price of the food served is just right enough to
make it even more attractive to most people.
\c00   A series of torches in the rooms along with a window on the south wall make
sure enough light is shed to make it comfortable, and the maids here are
dressed somewhat more conservatingly than other rooms of the inn, since this
is after all something of a family place.

   Someone took the time to paint the ceiling in the room, depicting scenes
of a peaceful mountain covered in \c14snow\c00, the coloring almost perfect to give
the room a sense of freedom and it somehow seems larger than it actually is,

      <roomdescription>   You find yourself in one of the largest bathrooms you have ever seen, a
almost as large as the room it&apos;s attach to by itself. There is a large wooden
tub in here along with several buckets of water and a small heater to keep
the room comfortable and the water warm along with a series of very well
polished mirrors on the ceiling.
   A long bar is nailed across the wall with several colorful towels hanging
from it along with a complete set of calisthetics and perfumes, some ivory
brushes sculpted by artists and even a small wardrobe make of some sort of shiny
metal resembling silver to store several robes of various sizes.
