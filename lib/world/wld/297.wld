      <roomdescription>Warm light from the sconces on the wall floods this room, reflecting from
the &amp;Wwhite&amp;n of the walls. A few simple yet rich-looking chairs sit about the room,
one in each corner near the door and two before a large &amp;cglass&amp;n cabinet at
the far end of the room. The cabinet itself contains myriads of sparkling
pieces, everything from simple bands of &amp;ygold&amp;n and &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n to costly gems
in nearly every color of the rainbow.

it&apos;s furnishings meeting your eyes with rich tones of dark &amp;rc&amp;Rh&amp;Ke&amp;rr&amp;Rr&amp;Ky&amp;n wood.
There is a bed against the far wall, beneath a window, and a dresser beside
it. A desk sits across from that, and two chairs rest in a pair of corners.
There is also a fireplace here, stacked with wood ready for burning, and
a box of flint nearby.

beneath a large window, and a fireplace sits nestled into the western wall.

comfortable chairs for his clients while they wait.

      <roomdescription>Lark Lane extends westward, reaching out along the shops to provide a
method of travel for the scores of people who walk along it&apos;s length.
To the north, there is a rather large and classy-looking building, &amp;rred&amp;n
bricked and simply yet very tastefully done. It has several large &amp;ww&amp;ci&amp;wn&amp;cd&amp;wo&amp;cw&amp;ws&amp;n
that look out onto the street, windows filled with hanging &amp;gplants&amp;n and
greenery mixed with flowers of every shade. It appears to be a restaurant of
some kind, though there is no sign directly stating as much. The word
&quot;&amp;WAhndralea&apos;s&amp;n&quot; is painted just above the door in straight &amp;Wwhite&amp;n letters.
As you eye the building, a scent of baked bread reaches your nose from
the south, and if you turn, you notice a small but well-kept bakery.

and something that seems a little like fish assault your nose, along with
a curiously musky scent, perhaps burning incense from the candle shop
down the street. To the north, the restaurant &amp;WAhndralea&apos;s&amp;n extends,
though there is no visible door on this side, only windows decorated with
rich, exotic-looking &amp;g&amp;gplant life&amp;n&amp;n. To the south there is a squat building
of &amp;rm&amp;yu&amp;Kl&amp;rt&amp;yi&amp;K-&amp;rc&amp;yo&amp;Kl&amp;ro&amp;yr&amp;Ke&amp;rd&amp;n brick, and a sign with a large lock on it swings above

visible. It is open, largely, and covered by a &amp;ytaw&amp;Kny-&amp;kco&amp;Klo&amp;yred&amp;n tarp to keep
rain and wind off the patrons. Many varieties of fruit lie on the tables
to the west, and the proprietor works efficiently among them while also
maintaining conversations with some of his regular customers. Beyond the
fruit stand, the trees and paths of the park can be seen off across a
small field which seperates the relaxed &amp;gn&amp;ya&amp;Kt&amp;gu&amp;yr&amp;Ka&amp;gl&amp;n atmosphere from the rest
of the city. To the east you can see a stable that is attatched to an Inn
beside it to the south, and though it might seem the smells would conflict,
they strangely do not seem to.

&amp;ytaw&amp;Kny-&amp;kco&amp;Klo&amp;yred&amp;n tarp to shield the patrons from the elements. Off in

of a quaint but spacious park.

bustling on the street, though the signs are all of different things. It
is hard to make out exactly what they all stand for, being this far away,
but it looks as though they are all as painstakingly crafted as the others,

that surround the walls - large panes of &amp;cglass&amp;n seperated into diamond-shaped
blocks by little &amp;ki&amp;Kr&amp;ko&amp;Kn&amp;n veins. Under nearly every window is a table, and
servers can usually be seen walking to and fro among them. The proprietor
sits behind a &amp;ydesk&amp;n against the northern wall, and to one side is a 
stairwell leading to the upper levels.

      <roomdescription>As you step into this shop, quiet &amp;yb&amp;we&amp;yl&amp;wl&amp;ys&amp;n ring from the door when you open it,
and a well-dressed, quaint looking woman steps out from a small back room
to take a seat behind a small table at the back of the room. As you look
around, you notice the lack of windows in the room, as every wall is nearly
covered frame-to-frame with a large number and variety of wall hangings.
The pictures are seemingly random, everything from &amp;gf&amp;yo&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;ys&amp;Kt&amp;n scenes to 
portraits, and all are well-done and tasteful. There are a few small tables
throughout the room, covered in small pieces of some sculpter&apos;s self-expression,
in every medium ranging &amp;rc&amp;Ro&amp;rp&amp;Rp&amp;re&amp;Rr&amp;n and &amp;ywood&amp;n to &amp;Kstone&amp;n and &amp;rclay&amp;n.

      <roomdescription>Much as the sign outside told of, this shop is devoted entirely to dolls
and children&apos;s toys, though mainly to the former, and the shelves and racks
of the room are filled with varying sizes and shapes of life-like dolls.
Some are clearly more rich than others, extending even to real &amp;Kf&amp;yu&amp;kr&amp;Ks&amp;n to
line some of the clothing, and long billowing, curly hair. Others are
draped in silks of every &amp;ms&amp;bh&amp;ga&amp;yd&amp;re&amp;n, some in linens, some in cotton, but all very
beautifully hand crafted and priced appropriately. There are smaller tables
in various corners bearing such things as blocks and balls, more common and
plain toys, but they do not lack in craftsmanship for certain. In all, this
is a showing of someone&apos;s true caring about the happiness of children, but also
an appriciation for meticulous handiwork.

      <roomdescription>This shop appears rather well-lived in, and smells faintly of &amp;Koil&amp;n and
old metal. The locksmith sits behind his table at the far wall, usually
either scribbling in a ledger or turning an old lock over in his hands.
There are several shelves along the wall behind him, holding the various
tools of his trade, and one small &amp;cwindow&amp;n lies in each wall to either side of
him. Apart from that, and a couple of chairs before his table, there is
not much to this small, homey-looking store.

      <roomdescription>The first thing you notice upon entering this place is the relatively
plain setting of it. The walls and floor are &amp;Wwhite&amp;n, and it is trimmed in
simple &amp;ywooden&amp;n tones, the tables and chairs alike in a similar &amp;Wwhite&amp;n-and-
&amp;ywood&amp;n pattern. The apparent lack of color, however, is more than made up for
by the scores of brightly &amp;rc&amp;yo&amp;gl&amp;co&amp;Br&amp;be&amp;md&amp;n and yet tasteful, ornamental plant life.
When you look closer, however, it is clear that it is not purely decorative,
as much of the various potted plants and arrangements are in fact for sale.
Strange, but this restaurant appears to double also as a flower shop of sorts,
and judging by the constant bustle of the common room, it appears to do good
business that way. In any case, it is a pleasent and efficient, aesthetic
atmosphere. There is an open doorway to the west, leading into another
large dining room, and a closed door to the north which likely leads to
the kitchens. It opens every once in a while to accomodate a coming or
going server, and one of Ahndralea&apos;s more muscled staff guards it against
the unwelcome.

bustles back and forth behind it. The shelves behind them are filled with
innumerable varieties of &amp;ybreads&amp;n, confections, cookies, pastries, all
appearing to have been freshly-baked from the brick &amp;rk&amp;Ri&amp;rl&amp;Rn&amp;n in the rear of
shop. Across from the counter, on the opposite wall, shelves hold much of
yesterday&apos;s baked goods, wrapped and ready to be sold.

the various creations of the proprietor. &amp;rPots&amp;n, &amp;yj&amp;ru&amp;yg&amp;rs&amp;n, some simple sets
of earthenware, and a few ornamental pieces sit well within reach of the
perspective customer. Toward the back of the shop, there rests a large
&amp;ydesk&amp;n, behind which the owner sits when he is not working. There is a door
behind him leading to his work room, and on the other walls, small windows
shed some natural light into the room.

&amp;rf&amp;Rl&amp;ya&amp;wm&amp;Re&amp;rs&amp;n of several burning candles throughout the room shifting a bit in the
with candles, small jars of herbs and powders, mixing containers and a few
varieties of incense. There is an old-looking and worn but sturdy &amp;ytable&amp;n
toward the back of the room, and the proprietor usually sits behind it if
she is not attending the wicks of the &amp;wc&amp;Wa&amp;wn&amp;Wd&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;ws&amp;n or one of her customer&apos;s needs.
Several small windows break the planes of the walls as well, windows which
open on their hinges in the summer and close tightly during foul weather,
but always glisten with the reflecting candle &amp;rf&amp;Rl&amp;ya&amp;wm&amp;Re&amp;rs&amp;n.

there are indentations that denote glassless windows, but they are usually
closed. The view from here provides an overlook to the door connecting to
the Inn, as well as the outside.

sunlight sparkling off a &amp;Bp&amp;co&amp;wn&amp;Bd&amp;n that was hidden by the surrounding foliage.
A few small &amp;Wwhite&amp;n ducks swim about, accompanied by malards, and birds sing
from the branches above. There are a few stone and wooden benches gathered
around the water, sparsely placed so as not to disrupt the environment,
but generously so. Some lie down by the pond, and some back nestled in the
trees, but all look comfortable and well-made. The path you are on splits,
one fork going up northward and then west around the pond, one heading east
and north toward a small &amp;gg&amp;Ga&amp;gr&amp;Gd&amp;ge&amp;Gn&amp;n, and another headed west, likely 
connecting to the pond path in a circle.

      <roomdescription>Here lies one of the most breathtaking natural visions you have ever
seen, a meticulously sculpted and cared-for garden, lush and &amp;ggreen&amp;n
with life and vitality.  The surrounding &amp;gt&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;Ke&amp;gs&amp;n provide a smattering
of &amp;Ks&amp;kh&amp;Ka&amp;kd&amp;Ke&amp;n to offset the sunlight needed by the plants and flowers to
grow, just enough to provide relief, not enough to squelch.  There is
a tiny path wandering among the little plants, made from
&amp;wm&amp;Wu&amp;Yl&amp;rt&amp;wi-&amp;Wc&amp;Yo&amp;rl&amp;wo&amp;Wr&amp;Ye&amp;rd&amp;n stones and set apart at an even walking pace.  Scores
of unique, delicate leaves stretch out and wrap around their flowers,
providing this place with a very content feeling to it, one of having
been well-loved by both caretaker and patrons alike.  There are 3
small &amp;ybenches&amp;n, one at each side of the garden and under the &amp;gt&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;Ke&amp;gs&amp;n,
and beyond them lies a bit of a field to seperate this place from the
rest of the buildings of Caemlyn.  They can still be seen, to be
sure, but it is clear that this is set apart in a special, secluded
way.

placed purposefully, lining the path with a certain symetrical quality,
but it does not look forced or false. Large &amp;rred&amp;n bricks begin a path to
the north, further into the hallway of &amp;gt&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;Ke&amp;gs&amp;n, and the west path leads

steps which likely take two strides each. They are gently sloping up, yet
there are a good score of them, so that it seems as though you rise more than
you do. On either side of you the hall of &amp;gt&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;Ke&amp;gs\c00 continues, pines now, and
their &amp;gneedles\c00 cover the steps as you pass by. When you look ahead of you,
suddenly you find that a large and very old-looking &amp;Kfo&amp;wu&amp;Wn&amp;wta&amp;Kin\c00 lies here,
the water cycling through a statue of a beautiful woman. Around her lie
strange &amp;Kb&amp;kl&amp;Ka&amp;kc&amp;Kk&amp;n coils, the form of a serpentine creature wound around her,
no doubt a dragon to those who know. &amp;gT&amp;Kr&amp;ge&amp;Ke&amp;gs\c00 circle this area thickly, veiling
it from the outside with dark shade, and the path which you entered upon is
the only visible way out. There are no benches here either, the only sitting
place being on the stones which surround the fountain, or the wide edge of
the basin.

more secluded part to it to the west. Here ducks often take shelter from
the sun, resting in the shade on fallen &amp;ylogs&amp;n and such. To the north extends
a small path through some tall &amp;ggrass\c00, and a field lies there, broken by small
clusters of trees that have grown together.

of &amp;Kshady&amp;n woods lies to the southwest. There is a path into them, curiously 
enough, covered by pine &amp;gneedles&amp;n and fallen &amp;yl&amp;re&amp;ya&amp;rv&amp;ye&amp;rs&amp;n. Where it leads is unclear,
as it is difficult to see much beyond the tree-line.

      <roomdescription>The path is rather &amp;Krocky&amp;n here, bordering on roughened, but it is still
quite easily passable. Trees dot the area, as well as some large bushes
that, upon closer inspection, bear a darkened kind of &amp;rb&amp;me&amp;rr&amp;mr&amp;ry&amp;n. East, there
is a small crossing of paths, and westerly the trail leads to a north
trail around the &amp;cpond\c00.

the deep shade of old, tall &amp;gtrees&amp;n. The trail begins to fade into &amp;rb&amp;wr&amp;Ki&amp;rc&amp;wk&amp;Ks&amp;n
to the southwest, taking an almost street-like appearance, but the woods
remain as deep and blackened as they were before, a stark contrast to
the sun.

The trees grow tightly together around the walkways, and there is rich
underbrush as well as some smaller, more delicate &amp;gplants&amp;n nearer to the
paths themselves. To the west, the trail rises on a slight hill, and then
slopes back down again suddenly, but you would have to be on the other side
of it to see why.

      <roomdescription>When you top the rise, suddenly it is as if the &amp;gtrees&amp;n have pulled back and
revealed to you an open-air theater that looked never to have completely
been there, seeming carved right out of the side of the hill. Five or six
rows of &amp;Kstone&amp;n benches and walkways lie tiered, for the audience, and half-
circle around a large, spacious stage. The stage itself, indeed the entire
theater and the 4 columns at it&apos;s cardinal points, are all etched from
the same rock, and there is a strange feeling of energy here. Half of the
area lies bathed in rich, golden &amp;ysu&amp;Yn&amp;wli&amp;Yg&amp;yht&amp;n or pale &amp;Wm&amp;wo&amp;Wo&amp;wn&amp;Wl&amp;wi&amp;Wg&amp;wh&amp;Wt&amp;n, and the other
in the dark of the tree&apos;s shadow. At the back of the stage is a small
building of some sort, likely to house props or the like, and it oddly
appears as though there is &amp;Kstone&amp;n paving behind the stage...

see the contrast of grey &amp;Kstone&amp;n and deep green &amp;gpines&amp;n around you, with a
crisp smattering of &amp;Wlight&amp;n, in whatever form it is, coming through the
&amp;gtree&amp;n branches. At the rear of the stage, there are two small closet-like
structures, both with locked doors and a line of columns between them.
Oddly, as you proceed behind the stage, you find that the ground has been
dug out and a fountain put in here, of all things, with the &amp;Kstone&amp;n continuing
around it in a rectangular pattern. The fountain is a simple one, with some
sort of sea &amp;cc&amp;gr&amp;we&amp;ca&amp;gt&amp;wu&amp;cr&amp;ge&amp;n scuplted near each end, and on the far side of that,
there are two more closets, identical to the first pair.

be able to make out outlines of some sort of building.

fountain, judging by the basin around it. To the north, there lies a
sort of rustic-looking building built of a &amp;Kdark&amp;n, rich &amp;yw&amp;ro&amp;yo&amp;rd&amp;n, and the
sign above the door bears a curiously &amp;Bc&amp;co&amp;gl&amp;Bo&amp;cr&amp;ge&amp;Bd&amp;n shoe. Southward, a &amp;Kloom&amp;n

as well as the pools of sunlight which filter in through 2 small windows.
The floor is covered by an old &amp;Wwhite&amp;n fur of some sort, likely an
animal at one time, yet though it&apos;s coat has been pressed down from the
feet of patrons, it still retrains a shine. As you gaze around the rest of
the store, shelves after shelves of various shoes and boots fill your eyes,
some newly made and some old, but all in good condition and of good
workmanship. There is a &amp;ydesk&amp;n near the back at which the proprietor keeps
his paperwork and business articles, and a lantern rests atop it near the wall.

attatched to the squat &amp;rbrick&amp;n building to the north, there is a sign
with a large, coiled &amp;yrope&amp;n on it, likely denoting a cordier. When
the wind passes by and nudges it, the hinges protest softly, causing the
sound every now and again. Southward, there is an open blacksmithy,
and the rings of the hammer on metal, coupled with the hiss of hot steel
in water and the creaking altogether make for a very strange discordant
music.

across it from the sunlight at the windows and the open door, and gold
from the &amp;ys&amp;rc&amp;Ro&amp;yn&amp;rc&amp;Re&amp;ys&amp;n on the wall. Several large looms lie about the room,
typically being worked at all hours, and there are also a handful of
smaller copies set into one corner, perhaps for sale. There is no desk to
speak of, merely tables of a rich, &amp;rred&amp;n wood alongside the weavers as they 
work the threads together, and a slightly larger one beside the elderly
woman who looks to be in charge. There are several &amp;gc&amp;co&amp;Bl&amp;mo&amp;rr&amp;yf&amp;gu&amp;cl&amp;n hangings on the
walls, mostly of outdoor scenes and elaborate borders, and similar works of
art lie draped across the ladies&apos; looms.

thicknesses, each with a different price marked on the wall above them.
Over all, this is a well-kept and clean store, but it is clear that workers

horseshoes, nails, simple tools, and a hundred other things. The proprietor
typically works at his anvil when he is in his shop, and if he is not there

musky sort of flower, as you enter this shop. When you look around, you
see a number of small &amp;ywooden&amp;n statues that have been carved into human
form, and they are covered in the most exquisite garb of all the shops
on Lark Lane.  The clothing is for both genders, and is all quite lavishly
done, not a plain piece in the store. That is not to say that they are 
gaudy, however, for even the most decadant gown is not overbearing, but
simply a piece of artwork. The proprietor sits behind a shiny desk of a
mahogany wood, and several windows shed a good deal of light into this

walls of buildings. To the east, there lies a shop marked with a sign above
the door, bearing a &amp;K&amp;Kblackened&amp;n quill and a piece of &amp;wp&amp;ya&amp;Wr&amp;wc&amp;yh&amp;Wm&amp;we&amp;yn&amp;Wt&amp;n. In the center
there lies babbling a beautifully sculpted fountain, looking to have been
etched from pure &amp;wal&amp;Wa&amp;wb&amp;Wa&amp;ws&amp;Wt&amp;wer&amp;n. The figure is of a tall, robed woman whose
facial features are carved delicate and beautiful, and her hair cascades with
the &amp;cw&amp;Ca&amp;wt&amp;Ce&amp;cr&amp;n down her back. One hand is stretched out over her head, the source
of the falling water, and her eyes look upwards. At her feet and around her
legs there is a stark contrast to the white of her form - the coils of a
sinuous &amp;Kb&amp;kl&amp;Ka&amp;kc&amp;Kk&amp;n dragon. &amp;cW&amp;Ca&amp;wt&amp;Ce&amp;cr&amp;n rushes from the creature&apos;s mouth, surrounded
by sharp, jagged teeth, but the generous basin of the fountain prohibits
anyone being close enough to touch it unless they stand directly in it.

of bells caresses your ear, and the scent of fresh paper and ink reaches your
nose. The walls are painted a fine, crisp &amp;Wwhite&amp;n and there is light pouring
into the room through large windows on most of the walls. The furnishings
are done in a simple &amp;yoak&amp;n wood and edged with whites, and fine sets of &amp;yoaken&amp;n

dozens of kinds and colors of ink rest on these shelves, all neatly and

rather strange sight - there are at least two dozen waist-high rocks of all
&amp;Kd&amp;yi&amp;gf&amp;cf&amp;Ke&amp;yr&amp;ge&amp;cn&amp;Kt&amp;n shades lined up into a winding, snaking trail, all touching so 
that it would not be difficult to walk from one to another, but from the
jags and peaks, it would require good balance. Beyond this series of rocks
lies a gathering of unusual-looking trees, their &amp;ybranches&amp;n oddly thick and
low to the ground. They seem quite climbable, rather easily so, and nicely
comfortable as well.

      <roomdescription>This room looks much like the second floor hallway did, with 3 large
doors and &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n numbers on each, this time from 4 to 6. There are
no further stairs, however, and if your destination was not one of the rooms,
you are at a dead end.

      <roomdescription>Entering the room bearing the 4 on the door, you find a cozy room which
is decorated in tones of a deep wood with just a slight red tint, something
perhaps like &amp;rm&amp;ya&amp;rp&amp;yl&amp;re&amp;n. There is a well-made bed and matching desk beside it,
with a fireplace across the room and two chairs before it. A small window
breaks the wall above the bed, shedding soft light into the room.

      <roomdescription>A &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n 5 glistens in the light as you pass by it into this room, and
the exquisite tones of dark, rich &amp;rc&amp;Re&amp;rd&amp;Ra&amp;rr&amp;n greet your eyes as well as your
nose. This room is lavishly bestowed with some of the most luxurious
furnishings, clearly the pride of the establishment. The bed is vast
and bears 4 posters, all banded with delicate &amp;Ws&amp;wi&amp;Wl&amp;wv&amp;We&amp;wr&amp;n. The dresser beside
it holds a great &amp;wm&amp;ci&amp;wr&amp;cr&amp;wo&amp;cr&amp;n atop it, and a vase of fresh cut &amp;bf&amp;Bl&amp;go&amp;yw&amp;ge&amp;Br&amp;bs&amp;n rests
in front of it. There are two chairs before a broad fireplace, both
resting upon a thick fur carpetting that stretches across the floor. On
the opposite wall, there is a window which takes up nearly all of the
plane above waist level, and beneath it sits a professional-looking
desk, ready for work.

      <roomdescription>The door you enter through bears a silver 6 on it, and the room beyond is
arranged with wood made from dark, shiny &amp;yw&amp;Ka&amp;yl&amp;Kn&amp;yu&amp;Kt&amp;n. A small window gives light
to the room, pouring onto the floor a bit in front of the fireplace. On the
opposite wall, there is a large bed and a dresser beside it, and a pair of
chairs rest in the far corners.

      <roomdescription>&amp;kDarkness&amp;n spreads out in thick, embracing &amp;Kte&amp;kn&amp;Kdr&amp;ki&amp;Kls\c00, broken only by the light
from the open &amp;ydoor&amp;n behind you. The scent of dust, of old &amp;bw&amp;Ba&amp;ct&amp;Be&amp;br&amp;n, of something
freshly burnt fill your nostrils as shadows fill your vision and the sensation
of descending stairs takes your feet. Turning as well, around and around, and
it becomes clear that you walk down a long spiral staircase. Abruptly, one
turn reveals a release of the &amp;kdarkness&amp;n as if moving around a wall, and the
soft, warm glow of &amp;rf&amp;Ri&amp;yr&amp;re&amp;n spreads across the area to illuminate it. Rough hewn
walls of stone run along beside you, dark and grey, covered in &amp;wco&amp;Kb&amp;wwe&amp;Kb&amp;ws&amp;n. The
room is vast and open, the staircase taking you down quite a ways before
ending, leaving the hidden &amp;ydoor&amp;n through which you came about 20 feet above
your head. When you look around, the source of the light becomes clear,
emitting from tongues of &amp;rf&amp;Ri&amp;yr&amp;re&amp;n which dance and reflect in the sconces on the walls.
Beside each of the three of them, there is a &amp;ydoor&amp;n, and the southern wall which
is closest to you is bare, save for a long wooden table.

    <roombasic title="\c00A small, quiet room" vnum="29767" zone="297">
      <roomdescription>The door opens on quiet hinges to admit you to this quiet, comfortable room.
Beneath your feet, there is a hardwood floor, and stretched out over a few
feet of it is a &amp;Wwhite&amp;n fur rug of some kind. It lies before a large fireplace
and &amp;Kmantle&amp;n, over which lies a delicate painting of an intricate, rich &amp;ys&amp;ru&amp;Rn&amp;ms&amp;re&amp;yt&amp;n.
On the wall nearest to you there lies a table covered in books, papers, and
candles of all sorts, taking up most of the smallish wall. A chair sits
before it, strangely the only chair in the room. In one corner lies a soft
bed, a dresser to one side of it, and bookshelves covering the rest of that
wall. Apart from that, there is little detail to the room save the armoire
which rests beside the fireplace, ornate and intricately detailed with
serpentine carvings of all kinds.
