      <roomdescription>A tiny bell rings from above the door as it opens into \c06Kalahad's\c00 shop, the
faint scent of \c06silk\c00 in the air.  The shop is decorated with \c04linen\c00 flags
hanging from the walls, each showing the different banners that represent
each country of the world.  A soft, white mat covers the entire floor of
the shop, its edge embroidered with \c01dragons\c00.  The counter is made of
\c06glass\c00, and inside the counter is a fine variety of invaluable jewels, such
as diamonds and \c01rubies\c00.  Two comfortable looking chairs rest in front of
the counter, for customers to sit and relax while looking over the
selection of jewelry and clothes.  A tiny \c03hammer\c00 used for crafting jewelry
lies on the \c06counter\c00, right beside it rests a small \c03g\c10o\c03l\c10d\c03e\c10n\c00 ring.  An open
door to the north leads to the storage room, where cloths in a variety of
\c01c\c04o\c03l\c02o\c05r\c06s\c00 have come from all over the world.

porthole on the north wall.  A tall bookcase stands on the west wall, full
of \c03tattered\c00 books and stacks of notes.  A large \c01b\c08r\c01i\c08c\c01k\c00 fireplace takes up
most of the east wall.  In front of the fireplace stand a pair of tall,
cushioned chairs adjusted so they are partly facing each other.  A small
table stands between them, holding a large vase full of fresh daisys.

      <roomdescription>You are standing in the first room of a quaint little cabin.  The
defeaning noise of the waterfall is muted hear, reduced to a peaceful
drone.  This room is not very large, nor is it very small.  On the north
wall, directly across from the entrance is a stone fireplace with two
chairs in front of it.  In the northwest corner is a woodstove meant for
cooking, and an assortment of pots and pans hang nearby.  The room is
sparsely furnished, with only two chairs in front of the fireplace and two
simple wooden chairs around an oaken table in the center of the room.  
The there's a door on the west wall that proly leads to the bedroom.

is a headstone, marked with the following:

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when 
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend 
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes 
I thought you'd died alone, a long long time ago  

Oh no, not me 
I never lost control 
You're face to face 
With The Man Who Sold The World  

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home 
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed 
I gazed a hazey stare at all the millions here 
I must have died alone, a long long time ago  

Who knows? not me 
We never lost control 
You're face to face

of the usual smells of an inn.  The only smell that is easily picked out
is the smell of burning wood, not an unpleasant smell.  The room is well
lit, and the tables are spread about in an ordered fashion, each one of
them cleaned very well, almost no stains mark them.  The bar is also
clean, as is the man behind it.  Serving girls walk about the room, taking
orders and delivering meals to customers.  There is a fire burning in the
center of the left wall, and there is a picture of a nightflower bursting
on the ceiling.

      <roomdescription>Soft, velvet curtains of deep \c04blue\c00 drape over a large, bay window.  The
window opens onto an expansive vista of the ocean, colours swirling and
blending together in a beautiful vortex as \c13waves\c00 crash against the shore
and \c23gulls\c00 cry to their mates.  Up against the northern wall of the room is
a great wooden bed carved like a cresting wave.  Its sheets are soft,
muted tones of \c09green\c00 and \c04blue\c00 silks.  From the topmost of the bed's crest
flows netting like \c02seafoam\c00 down the sides of the bed.  Next to the bed is
a small stand of mahogany, carved ornately like a living thing of lush
\c09vines\c00, a tangle of which forms the legs.  The floor is a highly polished
wood, painted with tiny, intricate strokes like magic transforming the
floor into the bottom of \c03seafloor\c00.  The southern end of the room is
dominated by a large \c03wardrobe\c00, the panels of which are carved into a
harbor scene of great \c04sea-fareing ships\c00.  There is a polished mirror next
to the wardrobe.  The mirror is about six feet in width, ten feet in
length, and three feet in height.  A \c06chair\c00 in one corner adds an almost
surreal quality to the room it appears to be a large \c09conch \c02shell\c00 with soft
\c13silk\c00 cushions in the hollow, making this \c06chair\c00 exceeding comfortable.

      <roomdescription>The faint tick tock of a clock fills this perfectly square room, the
pendulum swinging from side to side over the mantle that it sits upon.  A
strange dwelling this is, no door or window can be seen and yet the room
appears to be well lighted, spacious.  The room itself seems to be divided
into three parts, the smallest being the living room.  A couch, covered
with a dark, earthen green fabric, rests in the southeastern part of the
room.  Steams rises from a white cup that rests upon the dark, wooden
table that sits right in front of the couch.  Seperating the kitchen from
the living area is a small, two chaired table.  A vase of fresh flowers
sits in the middle of the table, the fragrant aroma almost completely
masking the underlying scent of burning wood.  The source of the smell is
a small woodstove that is placed in the southwestern corner.  The largest
part of the room by far is the sleeping area.  A huge bed rests on the
middle of the northern wall, four wooden posts rising up from each corner.
Two tables sit upon either side of the bed, both covered with books and
scattered pieces of paper.  A large wadrobe sits on the west wall from the
bed, one door slightly ajar.  The wooden surface of the wardrobe has been
etched with intricate strands of ivy, flowers and birds resting among the
leaves.  On the eastern wall, between the bedroom and the living area, is
a large fireplace.  It's cherry stained mantle laden with figurines.  The
ticking clock hanging on the wall, right above the mantle.

      <roomdescription>At one time, the large field must have been a farmstead.  Time, however,
or perhaps disuse have left it wild and overgrown.  The treeline
encroaches and the grass and flowers of the land grow haphazardly.  On the
edge of the deeper woods rests a nicely sized farm house.  Colored in the
soft tones of natural hardwoods weathered over the years, the house has a
certain rustic, well-loved look.  Standing two stories high, with a number
of windows angled to catch the sunlight at different times of the day, the
house also boasts a rather large porch, which looks to be a more recent
addition.  Curving around one corner, the well-crafted, open-air porch
covers a full half of the outer portion of the house.  A similarly newish
looking roof of wood panels covers it, supported by skillfully carved
wooden pillars.  A hardwood door bearing a knob of burnished brass allows
entry into the home.

suggest.  Rich throw rugs of deep blues and rich burgundies dot the
smooth, carefully laid hardwood of the floor itself.  Everywhere rich wood
tones glow in the warm light of the sun, or the flickering of candle
sconces in the evening hours.  A large stone fireplace dominates the east
wall, surrounded by various furniture.  An obvious den, whose welcoming
surroundings give way via an archway into a dining room set with hand made
and carved table and chairs.  A staircase rises around the corner to the
west, framed and concealed by a carefully kept kitchen nook, complete with
aesthetically pleasing cabinetry and counters.  The sills of the windows
are dotted with small wood carvings.  Animals, figures, various symbols.
Everything has a carefully tended, lived-in look.

upwards towards the rooms above.  Covering the walls are various
tapestries of unknown origin and a few portraits of what surely are House
Anshar nobles.  A coat rack stands in the corner, and over it are draped
several coats of expensive cut and cloth.

in no apparent scheme.  Some of these couches have large armchairs next to
them - perfect for an intimate conversation.  Small end tables and coffee
tables are arranged next to the couches as well.  Two very large windows
occupy one of the walls, giving a very good look at the street below.  
During the daytime, sunlight pours through these windows and bathes the
room in its warm light.  Underneath the pair of windows is a very large
bar area.  On the counter, dozens upon dozens of bottles of spirits lay
ready for consumption.  Empty goblets rest there as well, ready to be
used.  On the walls, more tapestries with muted colors.  A very large map
of Camelyn graces one of the walls.  It looks very old and was obviously
done by a master cartographer.

lay tangled on top of the gigantic feather mattress.  A small end table
lays beside the bed, and several empty bottles of wine lay haphazardly
balanced there.  The desk that stands in the corner is a mess of papers
and a bottle of ink has spilled and then dried.  The dark curtains remain
drawn across the windows at all times.  A large wardrobe lays against the
same wall as the bed, and it's doors are open wide.  The contents can be
clearly seen - dozens of fine coats, shirts, and breeches lay neatly hung
up.  Several pairs of boots are placed in order at the foot of the
wardrobe.  A large portrait of a beautiful, naked, brunette woman reposing
on a sofa is hanging on the wall opposite from the bed.

the canted front wall of the rear cabin.  Steep stairs running up to
either side of the central door, which is sunken two steps below the deck.
Graceful walls sweep down to the outside of either stair, melding with the
light graceful rails that run the length of the deck.  Two sturdy raked
masts rise high from the relatively narrow deck, and a third shorter spar
rises from the center of the elongated rear castle.  The Blade's
triangular sails are furled at the moment, but make an impressive sight
nonetheless.  Between the two primary masts, a pair of broad trap doors
hang open to the cargo space below.

      <roomdescription>A heavy oak door opens inward on this room, off of the deck of The
Maiden's Blade.  The rear wall of this space sports two banks of thickly
shuttered windows, which typically stand open, to either side of the wall.
Between the two sets of windows, the wall is ornamented with a massive map
of the known world, delicately scribed in exquisite detail, and picked out
in expensive colored inks.  Below the map, placed prominently at the back
of the room, stands a heavy wooden desk, with a broad empty surface.  In
the space before the desk there is a broad open path straight to the main
door.  To the port side of the cabin, a narrow pair of stairs leads
alternately down belowdecks, and up to the aft deck.  To the starboard
side of the path there is bolted a small wooden table, surrounded by
several chairs, likewise secured to the floor.  Along the walls are one or

      <roomdescription>Dark paneled walls have lanterns on gimbals that stay upright in the worst
of weathers and are hung with many small oil paintings of various lands.
A narrow railed staircase leads up along the port side of the room, and
two large armchairs have been bolted to the floorboards in the alcove
beneath it.  The room is dominated by a massive oak dining table, which is
secured in place, lengthwise across the room.  It is laid out with fine
domani lace, and elegant hardwood chairs are bolted at intervals around
it.  Secure on the floor there stretches a broad expanse of deeply piled
carpet, of a pattern imported from Shaara.  Towards the rear wall of the
Cabin, several sturdily shuttered bookshelves are attached to the wall
between a series of closed doors, and a set of low benches are set into
the walls, in a manner which allows them to be folded up and latched in
place.  Several more cabinets reside near the front of the room, likewise
latched, these containing a suprisingly delicate and refined set of
tableware.

and orderly, with small and large bowls of polished wood ready to receive
the ingredients of the next meal.  A couple of chairs are arraigned to
either side of the table, low, backless and wooden, they none the less

system, for moving the heavier goods up and down the length of the hold.

connect to the masts, spars, and sails in seemingly random fashion,
allowing the whole comglomeration to be adjusted in the most minute
detail.  The central mast is mounted with a series of small wooden
handholds, which lead up to a small unenclosed platform near the top, from
which a lookout can survey the surrounding seas.

rather bulky clothes chest, situated close enough to the writing desk that
it could be used as a makeshift stool.  A small porthole of polished &amp;rb&amp;Rr&amp;ya&amp;Rs&amp;rs&amp;n
and real glass is set into the wall above the bed, and another pair are
set into the starboard wall - there's no clear indication of how the cabin
is lit at night, for there are no lamps or candles present.  The elegant,

      <roomdescription>Set up deep in the forest, the warm &amp;yglow&amp;n of a campfire provides abundant
light for the surrounding area.  A tripod has been set up across the fire,
three heavy chains hanging down to hold a \c23black\c00 pot just above the
flickering flames.  The aroma of a hearty stew wafts through the campsite
on the gentle \c06br\c07ee\c06ze\c00, the sound of rustling leaves adding to the peaceful
atmosphere of the night.  Other preparations are in plain site, hinting to
the fact that this might not be a temporary site.  Piles of wood are
stacked up neatly off to one side of the area, far enough away from the
fire to not be a hazard but close enough to not be a burden.  A rack of
various types of weapons is set up close to where the horses are hobbled,
the silvery bits of metal glistening in the faint light from the stars.  
Hanging from the limbs of a nearby trees are chunks of salted and smoked
meats, as well as sacks of other food items such as flour, rice and dried
\c01v\c02e\c03g\c01et\c03a\c01b\c02l\c03e\c01s\c00.  A break in the boughs of the surrounding trees provide the
beautiful site of the stars, laying against a blanket sky of the deepest
\c04blue\c00.  Situated several paces back from the fire are three sturdy, canvas
tents.  The one to the right is back a bit further than the rest and
somewhat larger also.  The other two are placed so close that the edges
meet and it seems to make a two room tent instead of being seperate.

being a make-shift building of canvas.  Rectangular in shape, four sapling
trees make up the dome shaped top in which the canvas drapes over.  Each
fastened together at the corners with wide straps of leather.  Each of the
four corners rest on top of the splitted ends of other saplings that are
tilted slightly to make for a wide base.  Rugs are scattered across the
floor of the tent to provide protection from the ground, keeping the
sleeping bag from resting on the sometimes damp ground.  The sleeping bag
is made from the softest of furs on the outside, varying in color and
texture, and the inside made from black silk-like material so that it will
be soft against the skin.  Two small chest rest upon either side of the
head of the sleeping bag, each open to reveal clothing for both men and
women among other personal possesions.

entirely in &amp;Kblack&amp;n, a &amp;Wdisco&amp;n ball hanging from the center of the ceiling. Next, the ceiling
transforms into a thousand panels of &amp;Wg&amp;Cl&amp;Wa&amp;Cs&amp;Ws&amp;n, letting in the &amp;Ym&amp;noo&amp;Yn&amp;n and &amp;Cs&amp;Wta&amp;Cr&amp;W light&amp;n.

ace will appear on a wall, then vanish just as it came, nameless and eerie. The &amp;Ys&amp;Ru&amp;Yn&amp;n

soft scent of &amp;Mf&amp;Rl&amp;Yo&amp;Mw&amp;Re&amp;Yr&amp;Rs&amp;n.  But, eventually, everything shifts to something else.  Enjoy
your stay, and do try to not get lost.

      <roomdescription>The inside of the cabin is rather cozy.  The smooth-sanded walls are
stained a deep reddish color, and the brick fireplace enhances the red
appearance of the walls.  The solid oak door is remarkably heavy, but
swing easily on the well-oiled steel hinges holding it in place.  There is
a wrought-iron stand next to the fireplace, and it is full of dry
firewood.  The fireplace itself is the centerpiece of the room, the bricks
perfectly laid and mortared.  The inside is coated with carbon residue and
bits of charred wood, indicating heavy use.  The room lacks furniture of
any kind save for the large chest in the far corner from the door, which
is made of the same oak the door is, and is gilded with silver.  A heavy
iron lock adorns the front of the chest, keeping it firmly sealed.  
Through the window on the same wall as the door and its partner on the
opposite wall, the surrounding land can be seen.  A sparse wood begins a
few feet from the cabin in all direction, trees a few feet apart.  Most of
the trees are diciduous, but a few pines and spruces can be seen.

bits of wood or bone stuck to them.  The eastern cases contain a variety
of ancient looking swords.  There is also a small hallway leading to the
rose garden on the east wall.  The southern wall is primarily covered by a
large screen.  Painted on the screen, a very large and fierce looking
Raken is hovering over the seal of the House Rahiedar.

Grampa Smurf, reading to a group of smurflings, while Smurfette sits to
the side, watching.  The sky is always &amp;bb&amp;Bl&amp;bu&amp;Be&amp;n and &amp;Ysunny&amp;n, except for when the
shadow of that nasty cat Azrael darkens it.

      <roomdescription>A small clearing opens among the trees, several stumps still dotting the
edges of the opening.  At the western edge of the cleared space lies a
broad expanse of water, perhaps a hundred spans across, heavily overhung
by branches upon either bank.  A sluggish current stirs the smooth surface
of the water in places, as the river flows south to the Sea.  A narrow
track leads east into the woods from here, to the main road and then to
Ebou Dar.  Several small cabins are scattered about, for the most part
located back under the overhanging tree branches.  At the center of the
clearing is a single larger structure, quickly constructed of rough-hewn
planks in the same fashion as the various other buildings, but much larger
in scale.  Situated beneath the shade of several large trees, it is devoid
of windows, but a single broad door hangs on runners at the western end of
the building, to allow entrance.  From that large door a ramp of stone
slabs has been laid, and a rutted dirt track leads down to a wooden pier
at the water's edge.

piles driven into the riverbed.  The brown and murky water which flows

seems as serviceable as any city's more permanent facilities.  The far
side of the river seems somehow gloomy and oppressive, the bank only a
dark blur, lost beneath heavy overhanging branches and dangling strands of
swamp moss.  Downstream, however, the distant sound of surf can be heard,
and the cries of seabirds echo across the open water.

otherwise have branches that hover above the clearing.  A tent is fastened
down here, the dark material it is made out of looking almost rough.  
Firewood is stacked by the tent, ready to be used to feed the fire.  A
long line goes from one tree to the other, a laundry line almost.  A large
barrel of water sits near the tent as well, ready to use for washing or
other simple tasks.  The shafts of light that pierce through the trees,
whether it be moonlight or sunlight, illuminates the dirt bared ground,
from where the grass has been worn away.  The clearing itself seems to
have not been here long, but also seems to be used often.  Set up on one
of the trees is a small target, seeming to have many knotches in it where
it has been struck or shot with something.  
&amp;n    The sounds that surround the camp are that of the forest.  Birds
chipring, squirrels chittering, and the occasional growl of a bear or howl
of a wolf.  The rustling of foilage also is occasionally heard, indicating
a deer that has passed by.  The clearing is quite peaceful, offering an
aura of comfort and rest.

sorts.  The dirt floor is covered with expensive-looking Tairen carpets
and the walls are covered in tapestries of fine Shaaran silk.  In the
middle of the room there is a low table upon which some glasses filled
with oosquai stands.  Around the table, there are several comfortable
cushions decorated with quaint patterns.  In a corner, there is a large
keg with a tap.  A nice soporific smell of incense is slowly emanating
from several tall firepans.  Other than that, there are not many pieces of
furniture.  To the west, a pearl drapery leads to another part of the
tent.  The exit out of the tent is to the south.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;yA crude fence made of rope tied around tall posts encloses this
rectangular area.  The fence doesn't have an opening, so it is necessary
to step over the ropes to get inside.  The dirt is carefully cleared of
any stones or roots that otherwise would stick up from the ground.  The
path leading to the campsite is to the southwest.  &amp;n

    <roombasic title="A Cozy Country Manor" vnum="31586" zone="315">
      <roomdescription>This is the main entrance to a cozy manor.  Upon the floor is a bear rug.
There are large lampstands made of brass and shaped like lions.  It is a
small gathering area and as such has a sofa and a couple of chairs covered
in leather.  A mahogany table has a silver bowl on it that holds the cards
of visitors to the manor.  Two windows flank each side of the door.  The
windows are arched to a point and are paned with polished horn.  The door
is very interesting as it is very thick, made of cypress, and heavily
carved with hunting scenes and landscapes of Andor and Shienar.  The thick
pillars of beeswax candles sit on the table and scent the room with honey.

stands poised above a new porcelain sink, the colour of a newly laid bird
egg.  There are polished shelves, bins and carved cabinets all about the
kitchen to hold all the things required for sumptuous cooking.  A round
window above the sink and two narrow windows on either side of the
fireplace look out upon the gardens.  In front of the fireplace is a cozy
table with a gathering of well cushioned chairs.  The stairs lead down
into a well stocked cellar.
