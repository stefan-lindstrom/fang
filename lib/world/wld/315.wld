    <roombasic title="\c06Kalahad&apos;s Shop\c00" vnum="31501" zone="315">
      <roomdescription>A tiny bell rings from above the door as it opens into \c06Kalahad&apos;s\c00 shop, the
faint scent of \c06silk\c00 in the air.  The shop is decorated with \c04linen\c00 flags
hanging from the walls, each showing the different banners that represent
each country of the world.  A soft, white mat covers the entire floor of
the shop, its edge embroidered with \c01dragons\c00.  The counter is made of
\c06glass\c00, and inside the counter is a fine variety of invaluable jewels, such
as diamonds and \c01rubies\c00.  Two comfortable looking chairs rest in front of
the counter, for customers to sit and relax while looking over the
selection of jewelry and clothes.  A tiny \c03hammer\c00 used for crafting jewelry
lies on the \c06counter\c00, right beside it rests a small \c03g\c10o\c03l\c10d\c03e\c10n\c00 ring.  An open
door to the north leads to the storage room, where cloths in a variety of
\c01c\c04o\c03l\c02o\c05r\c06s\c00 have come from all over the world.

    <roombasic title="A Small, Well Hidden Cottage" vnum="31502" zone="315">
      <roomdescription>This house is very well \c10lit\c00 despite the fact that the only window is a tiny
porthole on the north wall.  A tall bookcase stands on the west wall, full
of \c03tattered\c00 books and stacks of notes.  A large \c01b\c08r\c01i\c08c\c01k\c00 fireplace takes up
most of the east wall.  In front of the fireplace stand a pair of tall,
cushioned chairs adjusted so they are partly facing each other.  A small
table stands between them, holding a large vase full of fresh daisys.

    <roombasic title="A Cozy Bedroom" vnum="31503" zone="315">
      <roomdescription>This room is dominated by a very large, comfortable looking bed on the
north wall.  A tall dresser stands to the east of the bed, it&apos;s old rugged
look gives the room a well lived in feel.  To the west of the bed is a
small wash basin, enclosed in a small nook carved from the wall.  A number
of small windows allow a great deal of light to enter, diffused by \c23g\c07r\c23a\c07y\c00
window shades.

    <roombasic title="A Room in Tallon&apos;s Cabin" vnum="31504" zone="315">
      <roomdescription>You are standing in the first room of a quaint little cabin.  The
defeaning noise of the waterfall is muted hear, reduced to a peaceful
drone.  This room is not very large, nor is it very small.  On the north
wall, directly across from the entrance is a stone fireplace with two
chairs in front of it.  In the northwest corner is a woodstove meant for
cooking, and an assortment of pots and pans hang nearby.  The room is
sparsely furnished, with only two chairs in front of the fireplace and two
simple wooden chairs around an oaken table in the center of the room.  
The there&apos;s a door on the west wall that proly leads to the bedroom.
