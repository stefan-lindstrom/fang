      <roomdescription>You are nearing an intersection of roads. To the south a wide
road from Caemlyn continues northeast to the city and south to

      <roomdescription>The road to Lugard to the south and Four Kings to the north passes
through small hills here. Scattered trees grow among the low
valleys, their leaves yellowed and faded. A flock of ravens perches
on a large oak tree in the middle of a field to your left, and
the sounds of their cawing reach your ears. You have heard stories
about ravens - they are agents of the Dark One - ripping lone
animals and even people apart.

of houses near Four Kings in the distance. Oddly enough, there are
no farms in the region, and the crooked rooftops of the inns and

      <roomdescription>This wide dirt road branches south from the main street of
Four Kings, heading toward Lugard, the capital of Murandy
off to the south. Wagon wheels have made deep furrows in
the dirt road, and hoof prints are scattered along them.
Many merchants pass this way, as Lugard is a large trading
center, and Four Kings a stopover town.
