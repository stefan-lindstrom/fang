    <roombasic title="The First Common Room of The Companion&apos;s Rest" vnum="300" zone="3">
      <roomdescription>Stepping inside the inn from Ring Street, the atmosphere changes quite 
quickly. The activity of the streets of Illian is replaced by the warmth
and comfort of one of the most famous Inns in Illian. Pewter sconces in the
shape of the Horn of Valere illuminate this cozy common room. Sofas covered 
in rich fabric surround an oak coffee table in front of the hearth which most
always contains a roaring fire. Serving girls dressed in neat uniforms of a pale
yellow linen are readily available to assist visitors. The large oak bar in the 
rear of the common room is well stocked, a mirror equal to it&apos;s length hangs 
behind it, etched intricately with a Horn of Valere design encircled with the
words, &quot;The Companion&apos;s Rest.&apos; A small oak podium stands just inside the door
with a leather bound ledger lying open upon it. Doors leading to other parts of
the Inn lie on the eastern and western walls.

      <roomdescription>\c00The shadows play on the walls of this tiny alcove. There is no furniture present, 
save a small table bearing a ledger and quill pen. A well worn green rug with what
appears to be the Horn of Valere lies on the floor and a few well placed candles 
leave enough room for notices to be written here. The door that led you here blends
into the wall much as it did on the other side, making it more than obvious that not
just anyone is given the right to come here.

      <roomdescription>The commotion of the common room is easily heard in this
portion of the hallway. Serving girls move busily about the
hall reflecting how very well staffed this Inn is. Trays laden
with mugs of ale and steaming plates of regularly pass under the
noses of those milling about in the hallway. Noted for it&apos;s fine 
wines and excellent kitchen, many Illianers often find themselves
relaxing and dining here.

silver sconces provide a soft light for the trip to the second floor. 
At the base of the stairs a comfortable looking gray loveseat rests  
against the wall with a small coffee table in front of it. Guests can
often be found seated on the loveseat, awaiting a serving girl to show
them to their room.

      <roomdescription>\c00Quiet dinner conversation fills the air as serving
girls make their way around the various tables taking
orders and delivering food. A crystal chandelier hangs
from the ceiling over what appears to be the center table,
reserved for nobles and other important guests. Each table is
decorated with linen napkins and fine china. Centerpieces of
fine crystal in the shape of the Horn of Valere are the highlight
of each table. Soft music provided by a violinist adds the finishing
touch to this pleasant dining atmosphere.

      <roomdescription>A large brass chandelier immediately takes the attention
of most that step into this foyer. An oak desk with a velvet
cushioned chair is set on the east wall, with a large book
lying open on it. An ink pot and green plumed quill pen rest
next to the book. There is most always a receptionist of sorts
seated behind the desk waiting to register new visitors, or to
direct them to into the common room or wherever in the city
of Illian that they may be headed. The noise of the street
is barely audible through the large oak front doors.

      <roomdescription>Patrons seem to have been filtered here from the common room. A large bay window
looks out onto Ring Street and several oak tables and chairs fill this room. The
air is filled with gossip and stories from the travellers that gather here. One 
wall is almost consumed by a map of the world that has had several markings and
notations of sitings of the Horn of Valere. No one place seems to be marked more
often than any other, making it clear that the Hunt is very busy. Serving girls 
hurry around with trays laden with food and drink. In the rear corner of the room,
near the door to the dining room, stands a small stage fully equipped for
entertainers to perform.

    <roombasic title="The Companions Rest Smoking Room" vnum="309" zone="3">
      <roomdescription>The smell of fine tabac fills the air of this room, most likely reserved for
the gentleman patrons of &apos;The Companions Rest&apos;. Cushioned high back chairs 
upholstered in a deep burgundy velvet form a circle around a circular oak 
gaming table. The men that congregate here tend to be of the wealthy sort and
often become angry when they are disturbed. The only women that seem to be 
allowed in is the occasional serving girl refreshing drinks. A large stone
fireplace takes up the better part of the west wall, and almost always contains
a roaring fire, regardless of the weather outside. Stacked on the mantle are 
various statuettes and plates most likely related to tournaments held in Illian.
A portrait of Micah Laird, the original owner of this inn hangs above the fireplace.
The painting is almost eerie in how very real it looks, almost as though the old man
is watching over his favorite room.

some order to it. The ovens and fires constantly roaring
make this room almost unbearably hot, although the wide
windows do provide sufficient breezes. The back wall is 
lined with kegs of ale and bottles of alcohol. There is
barely a place to find a seat, but some of the serving
girls seem to have managed and are discussing the latest
gossip. The stables can be seen through the eastern door
which seems to be constantly swinging open with someone 
arriving or leaving.

library lies behind it. To the north, the beautiful
rock gardens are visible through the glass door.

walls. Sofas upholstered in a gray velvet with maroon cushions provide plenty
of seating for those that wish to just relax and read or play a game of stones
at one of the two gaming tables set up in the room. The door leading out to the
gardens seems to never be closed as the garden provides an equally inviting place
to find a bit of privacy and rest.

across all four walls of this area, breaking only twice to 
make space for two tiny doors. It seems as though the bottles
of wine here could very well date back to the Age of Legends 
due to the appearance of the bottles. They seem to be arranged
by color and age, all of them very well dusted and illuminated by
the brass lanterns hanging from hooks on the racks.

feeding time once again draws near. In the style of days gone this
stable is constructed of stone. Walls resembling the most complicated
of puzzles provide a cool cave-like atmosphere for the horses that reside
here. Stableboys run about carrying saddles and tack for the horses set
to leave today, while others are rubbing down the horses that have just
arrived. The apprentices from the smithy can often be found here gathering
horses to be taken to get shoed. The door to the west leads directly into
the inn.

A circle is chalked on the ground and solid oak benches sit
outside the edge for spectators. No racks of lathes are

and only used when the contestants draw steel. When a spar is
taking place the serving girls from inside carry trays of cold
beverages to the spectators and combatants. The path through the
rock gardens to the west leads back to the inn.

the area. The lack of trees in these gardens makes them
a perfect spot for stargazing. During the day, the noise
of the sparring yards often carries through.

      <roomdescription>The sun&apos;s reflection ripples on the calm blue waters
of this man-made pond. Small fish swim around in it as
well as the odd duck or two. Thick bushes surround this
section of the vast gardens belonging to The Companions
Rest to make the area secluded. Large old oak trees provide
welcome shade in the heat of the day, particularly for the 
men and women that take part in the sparring practices in the
yards not far from here. You can actually dive into the pond from here,
though it&apos;s probably not deep enough to drown any but a child.

rose gardens that line this cobblestone path. In hues
of red, white, yellow, and pink the roses seem to always
be in full bloom regardless of the season. Marble benches
sit on either side of the path in front of the Wisdom&apos;s
cottage for patients to wait, or for guests of the inn to
just relax and smell the roses. The tiny windows of the cottage
have window boxes filled with many different varieties of herbs
in them, adding even more wonderful smells to this small garden
area.
