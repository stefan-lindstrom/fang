      <roomdescription>The furnishings in this room do not match, but they are the best Salidar
has to offer, from the padded armchair upolstered in green silk to the 
stand-mirror in the corner with all its guilding intact, to the ornately 
carved wardrobe where Egwene&apos;s belongings now hang. The canopy of the 
bed and the drawn back bed curtains are trimmed in lace and frills. The
canopy of the bed and the drawn back bed curtains are trimmed in lace

      <roomdescription>   The most noticeable upon entering is that the small room is decorated
with dark &amp;ypaneling&amp;n and sharp contrasting lines with as much gilt as could
be found.  The bed that sits straight across from the door has a tall
canopy and the severity is only softened by the thinnest sheer &amp;ggreen&amp;n
fabric hanging erratically from the beams.  &amp;gFilmy curtains&amp;n decorating the
edge of the window behind, match perfectly and it all stirs in the whisper
thin breeze.  To the left of the bed, one can see a &amp;ydark &amp;rc&amp;yh&amp;re&amp;yr&amp;rr&amp;yy &amp;rw&amp;yo&amp;ro&amp;yd table&amp;n
which holds one half burned &amp;Wcandle&amp;n.  The chair standing beside it is rigid
with a lone cushion in fabric that matches the &amp;ys&amp;Kp&amp;yr&amp;Ke&amp;ya&amp;Kd&amp;n of the bed, dark
&amp;ggreen&amp;n and &amp;cblue squares with lace on the edges and small &amp;Ygold&amp;n tassels.  In
one corner, sits a &amp;ydark o&amp;Ka&amp;yk&amp;n writing &amp;ydesk&amp;n and opposite is a small wash
basin adorned with thin chipped Seafolk &amp;Wp&amp;wo&amp;Wr&amp;wc&amp;We&amp;wl&amp;Wa&amp;wi&amp;Wn&amp;n and a small &amp;cmirror&amp;n.

      <roomdescription>Tessa&apos;s suite is an octagonally shaped room, cluttered yet tidy. Against one wall 
rests an enormous bed, with an ornate headboard molded out of pure silver.  The
bed is strewn with down pillows and a large comforter, all of which are 
woven with silver thread. The effect, contrasting with black lacquered bedframe,
is quite stunning. Flanking the bed on both sides are black nightstands,
piled high with romance novels, and with luminescent globes resting upon them.
These globes are in fact strewn all over the room, some of them  abiding 
the laws of gravity, some openly defying them, and some hovering in  between.
A silver love seat is tucked in an opposing corner, glimmering discreetly
yet invitingly, while a silver beanbag chair rests across from it in  an
unceremonious heap. Plants are strewn around the edges of the room,
covering much of the walls with foliage. Thru the leaves you notice that the 
walls and ceiling are in fact a rich forest green, matching the plush carpeting.

      <roomdescription>What is now called the Little Tower was obviously quite 
recently a good-sized inn. Although the Aes Sedai have 
done more work on this building than most of the rest 
of the town, there still remains the comfortable undertone
in the furnishings and decorations, and also the architecture
of the building itself that only an inn can give off. 
To the east are the kitchens, and to the west lay some 
rooms that the Aes Sedai use for gathering, and holding 
audiences, and that sort of thing. The accepted rooms 
are also on this main floor, and white-garbed novices and
accepted in their \c01se\c03ve\c02n st\c23ri\c11pe\c10d\c00 dresses crisscross the 
hallways, obviously trying to look busy, and most actually are.

gentle light from the sconces on the walls fills your vision. Beyond,
directly in your line of sight, there rests a dark toned desk piled high
with papers in neat stacks, and two chairs rest before it. To your left
there is a third chair in the southwest corner, and a fourth, larger and more
comfortable chair, rests behind the desk for the Mistress. In the center
of the western all there is a long blade in a scabbard set on a pair of
hooks. A set of bookshelves line the wall to your right, and an ornate
armoire rests in the shadows beside a fireplace along the north wall.
A door breaks the wall on the other side of the chest, made from the same
rich oak wood as the one you entered through. While the room holds the
formality of darker tones, it also rests in a comfortability of having been
well-used.

been rebuilt in dark oak, and the entire building has been freshly 
painted in a p\c06al\c00e b\c06lu\c00e. Aes Sedai and Warders bustle in and out, along
with novices, looking uniformly hurried and busy and meek all at the
same time. A few Accepted in their white dresses with the seven-banded
hems of color stride along at a slower pace than the novices, but also
busily, obviously on errands for Aes Sedai. Little Tower Road
intersects here, going east-west.

      <roomdescription>The room is filled with simple chairs and tables.  A circular floor
covering woven in bright colors with a flame brightly glowing in
the center is the focal point of the room.  It is here visitors to
the Little Tower are brought to wait to visit with the Aes Sedai
or perhaps the Amyrlin herself.  Novices in pure white are
seen occasionally, as are those in the banded dresses and
the beautiful Aes Sedai.

      <roomdescription>Just to the north of here is the Little Tower, infamous in Salidar as
the place where all the decisions are made. The Aes Sedai discuss and 
arrange and plan and organize, and then their orders are handed down 
from above to be carried out by all the people who actually do the work.
Nobody complains, though, or if they do, they complain in barely audible
whispers and resigned sighs and shakes of their heads. Everyone here has
the utmost respect for the Aes Sedai, and besides, who would want to face
their wrath in questioning their decisions. Who wants to risk arguing 
with someone whose stares can freeze you in your tracks, size you up 
like a small lizard, and dismiss or belittle your existence with a sniff 
and a twist of her mouth...and that&apos;s on a good day. The Ajah Meeting
Houses are, naturally, close by the Little Tower, the \c11Blue Ajah&apos;s\c00
to the west, and the \c10Yellow Ajah&apos;s\c00 to the east.

      <roomdescription>You walk into a small house, in spite of its size, you feel very
comfortable being here. Four sofas with \c04d\c11ar\c04k b\c11lu\c04e s\c07i\c11l\c04k\c00 covers are set in
a square, decorated with \c06light blue pillows\c00, contrasting with the material
of the sofas. A rectangular oak coffee table, on top of a large
circular rug made in an array of blues to match the room, sits in the
center of the sofas. Set in the center of the table is a fine porcelain
tea set with \c04tiny blue roses\c00 etched on the rims of the cups and on the tea
pot itself. Silver teaspoons rest next to each cup. A large oak desk is
against the back wall, and a high backed desk chair with a blue velvet
cushioned seat sits in front of it. A tall bookcase stands on the west
side wall, containing a collection of books that must have been brought
from Tar Valon&apos;s library. There is a glass door on the bookcase with
a padlock at its handle--you can guess that it is well protected and not
to be touched by anyone without the key. A rocking chair with a deep blue
cushion embroidered with \c14white roses\c00 sits next to the bookcase. While two
tiny blue dishes sit next to the chair, the cat that they obviously 
belong to is nowhere to be seen. A large blue tapestry depicting the
Dragonmount hangs on the wall above the desk. The room is illuminated by 
well-placed sconces on the walls, and silver candle-holders set in
various places.

jars line the neatly erected shelves beneath each window. Pots containing
various fresh herbs soak up the sunlight that pours through the uncurtained
windows. Small covered with soft yellow quilts line one of the walls, most
likely in place for recuperating patients. A cushy cream colored sofa sits
on the northern wall. A long oak table stands in front of it, laden with 
various herbal guides and notes. A high table with bandages and poultices
stands next to the staircase which likely leads to the Aes Sedai quarters
above.

and hair of the women wildly, and forcing a few people to hold on to
their hats. There are flurries of dust, and the dried leaves, fallen 
from the trees, are swept through the legs of the people moving through
the town, all with obvious tasks to do. Everyone seems pleasant and 
respectful, yet everyone is busy. A few nod to one another in passing, 
smiling amiably, carrying bundles of this, and packages of that, wrapped
in canvas or brown paper. The sound of construction can be heard in the
distance...and no wonder, since the Aes Sedai have been fixing up the 
highly symbolic birthplace of a legendary Amyrlin ever since they arrived
here almost a year gone. The Ajah Meeting Houses, low, stone buildings, 
line the northern part of Aryman Boulevard, the \c02Green Ajah\c00 Meeting
House to the east of here, and the \c14White Ajah\c00 Meeting House to the
west.

weaving within itself and changing form with the waves of people exiting
one street and turning onto others. There are bubbles in the crowd, spaces
that open up quickly in a radius around any Aes Sedai who walk the streets
calmly, talking quietly to each other, and there is motion all around as
the Servants of All receive their gestures of respect, quick bows and curtsies
with brief nods or small smiles of acknowledgment. Ajah Row, as it is 
informally called by many in Salidar, continues here, with the \c03Brown Ajah\c00
Meeting House to the west, and the \c23Grey Ajah\c00 Meeting House to the east.

comfortable chairs upholstered in a soft cream velvet. Open volumes lie
across small tables that sit before each chair. A small teapot with matching
cups and saucers sits on the writing desk amidst a pile of notes. The staircase
on the west wall is virtually hidden in the disorder.

gray velvet sits before it. The smell of cinnamon permeates the air, most
likely from the mixture of potpourri simmering on the small table in front
of a newly upholstered gray sofa. A creme coloured woven rug sits in the
center of the floor, beneath a round oak meeting table. Matching oak chairs
sit around the table, each with a small gray backpillow sitting upon it. A
small staircase is visible on the east wall, likely leading to the Aes Sedai
rooms above.

the east, one of the oldest roads in Salidar. Narrow, just wide enough 
for a wagon to fit down and not much else, it is still filled with 
people, all apparently busy. Up ahead, to the north, there sit, lined
up all on opposite sides of the street, facing each other, the \c03six\c00
\c11Meeting\c00 \c14Houses\c00 \c23of\c00 \c10the\c00 \c02Ajahs\c00, and at the end of the street you can see
the Little Tower, rearing above all the other buildings around it, and
looking newer, also. The Aes Sedai had not moved in there but an hour, 
so the story goes, before they started issuing orders for renovations 
and additions added to it.

increase proportionally to the size of the street as you move along it, 
so there really isn&apos;t much room, but there is less and less room as
you approach the Little Tower, standing solidly at the very end of the
Boulevard. A few trees planted near the sides of the road offer scant
shade in the oppressive heat of the daytime, and at night the wind 
seems to whistle through their leaves. A contingent of soldiers pass 
through unceremoniously, on their way to the Army camp, most likely to
report back to their infamous general, Gareth Bryne, once Captain-General
of the Royal Guards in Andor, under the command of Queen Morgase, 
now exiled and commandeered by the Aes Sedai here, commissioned to 
raise an Army to help take back the White Tower and remove its Amyrlin.

in each corner of the room are accompanied by small tables each bearing a teacup
and saucer. The walls are painted bright white, and unadorned. A staircase is

would the \c14White Tower\c00 in Tar Valon: everyone works, especially
the novices in their white dresses, dusted over with a thin layer
of dirt from literally running from house to house all day, performing
chores and errands. South Salidar Road runs east to west here, the 
single working inn in it a guest house of sorts, but more often, the 
place where the messengers who come and go to all parts of the world
rest briefly before carrying out the interminable supply of orders
by the Aes Sedai. The docks by the river Eldar are to the west.

      <roomdescription>For years the village of Salidar had stood, virtually abandoned, 
before the Aes Sedai who left the White Tower upon Elaida&apos;s 
usurpation of the Amyrlin Seat from Siuan Sanche, began to 
gather here in Salidar to reform, reorganize, and begin plans
to correct the wrongs of the \c01Red Sister\c00 who caused the Breaking
of the \c14White Tower\c00. Now a fairly good-sized town, Salidar, the
birthplace of Deane Aryman, of the \c13B\c00\c11lu\c00\c13e\c00 \c13A\c00\c11ja\c00\c13h\c00, who replaced \c08Bonwhin\c00
as Amyrlin, after the conflict with Artur Hawkwing almost destroyed
the \c14White Tower\c00, is bursting to the seams with Aes Sedai, their
Gaidin, their servants, and the soldiers who have come to fight
for the Aes Sedai and the Dragon Reborn.
To the east you see a small shop, set just outside the limits of
Salidar.

      <roomdescription>   The most noticeable upon entering is that the small room is decorated
with dark paneling and sharp contrasting lines with as much gilt as could
be found.  The bed that sits straight across from the door has a tall
canopy and the severity is only softened by the thinnest sheer green
fabric hanging erratically from the beams.  Filmy curtains decorating the
edge of the &apos;&amp;Yw&amp;Wi&amp;Ynd&amp;Wo&amp;Yw&amp;n&apos; behind, match perfectly and it all stirs in the
whisper thin breeze.  To the left of the bed, one can see a dark &amp;yc&amp;rh&amp;ye&amp;rr&amp;yr&amp;ry&amp;n
&amp;yw&amp;ro&amp;yo&amp;rd&amp;n table which holds one half burned candle.  The chair standing beside
it is rigid with a lone cushion in fabric that matches the spread of the
bed, dark green and blue &amp;ys&amp;Kq&amp;yu&amp;Ka&amp;yr&amp;Ke&amp;ys&amp;n with lace on the edges and small gold
tassels.  In one corner a dark oak writing desk sits, brightened by the
&apos;&amp;Yt&amp;Wa&amp;Gpest&amp;Wr&amp;Yy&amp;n&apos; that hangs above it.  Directly across from that is a small wash
basin adorned with thin Seafolk porcelain and a small mirror.

at least one book lying on it, if not more.   The only other furnishings

pouring in and out of its door--messengers, novices, and servants 
hurrying about their work, while a few children hold hands and play

here, running north through the town of Salidar.

even just a mug of ale or sip of wine before they all go off again, 
everyone here on business for the Aes Sedai or the rather large army
the Servants of All are putting together quietly in the backforest of
Altara. Some here are even soldiers and servants, on their meal breaks, 
coming to find conversation and news of the outside world. The cook 
emerges from the kitchen, wiping her large wooden spoon on the front

before turning and going back into the kitchen, taking one of the 
younger barmaids by the ear and dragging her along for staring 
wide-eyed at a fresh-faced young soldier.

east is the main eating area of the inn, the sound of multiple 
conversations all going on at the same time drifting through the door, 
and the smell from the kitches enticing you to take advantage of the 
eating area as well. The innkeeper runs things smoothly, a small 
woman with a surprisingly loud voice, but she smiles as you enter, 
and seems very friendly and accomodating.

the room seem very comfortable. The decorations are in \c04b\c06l\c14u\c06e\c04s\c00, of
course, with lots of deeply cushioned chairs and sofas. A round

It intersects Altara Avenue here near the eastern border of the city, 
ending shortly about a quarter of a mile to the east, in a secluded
grassy area, a roped-off clearing that the Aes Sedai have set aside to 
be a safe gateway point so that no one will be accidentally injured by
the sudden, sharp opening of a Gate as the Aes Sedai carry on with their
business to other parts of the world and report back here.

lies in the middle of the floor. There is a rack, of what appear to be 
swords, by the door, and they look well-kept and used often. A quarter-
staff stands upright behind the door, full of notches, that appear
to have been caused by deflected objects. A small bookshelf stands 
past the rack of swords, full of books on the history of war and tactics. 
The books look to be old and well studied. You start to wonder what kind 
of woman lives in here.

woven rugs of various, rich shades of \c23g\c00r\c23e\c14y\c00. The walls are hung with 
tapestries depicting great moments in the history of Aes Sedai, most 
with Kings and Queens kneeling to them.  The furniture is obviously 
expensive, but it has a simple kind of elegance to it. At one end of the 
large room is a work table littered with papers, documents, 
books, pens and ink, and maps. Nearer to the bedroom you see a vanity 
table, its combs and brushes neatly aligned. The wardrobe is open, and 
you can see dresses and gowns in every shade of g\c23r\c14e\c23y\c00 and s\c14i\c23lv\c14e\c00r 
imaginable.  As you gaze into the bedroom, you see a large, yet simple,

\c14p\c00i\c23llo\c00w\c14s\c00. The whole room is very tasteful and elegant, much like

      <roomdescription>So named for the converted inn, now known as the Little Tower, the dirt-
packed road crosses in front of the looming slate-roofed oaken building.
The road is full of soldiers from Gareth Bryne&apos;s army, Aes Sedai talking 
amongst themselves and going about conducting matters of an always serious 
nature, their Warders patiently following them, novices in pure white, and 
Accepted in dresses of white and bands of seven colors around their hems. 
The citizens of Salidar move through the street, no less busy than the 
ageless women all around them, but always giving them plenty of space to
pass by, with a pleasant nod of the head or a &apos;Light illumine you, Aes Sedai&apos;.
To the west is the entrance to the Little Tower, and to the east is the
central fountain of Salidar, where people often gather to talk.
