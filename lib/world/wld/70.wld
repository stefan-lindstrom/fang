      <roomdescription>The Cairhien Road, better named the Silk Path as it begins its journey to the
Aiel Waste, leads right between the great, snow-capped mountains of the Spine
of the World. The miles of grey and brown rock tower over you, their foothills
blocking passage north and south. The paved road continues rather sinuously
along to the east into the Jangai Pass, and west back into Cairhien.

dotted with dried grass and trees that echo the heat permeating the world. Some
of the foothills are so close to the edge of the fifty pace wide road, they
loom above and occasionally block out the sun. You can see the edge of the
mountain range west of here, and think about heading that way.

flap around in a black crowd fighting each other and gorging on corpses,
swollen bodies hanging from the walls and thrown on the ground where it looks
like someone attempted to bury most of them. The vultures were able to easily
dig down to their dinner. The wooden gates of the merchant town hang off their

smoothed over a hundred-pace width and carved with a wind-weathered snake
entwining a staff a good three hundred paces high.  On the other side just
below the snow line you swear you see the light grey remnants of shattered
buildings and a stone dock hanging drunkenly down the mountain.  Surely 
that dates from before the Breaking.  Down the Pass to the west you can
see the town of Taien.  A few strange blotches are on the walls, and clouds

Each one different in shape and color, they are as beautiful as trees, but at
the same time simple and bare. A strong breeze ruffles your clothes, and with
their lengthening shadows these monuments remind you of graves. Usually the
Three-fold is teeming with some kind of life if you look hard enough, but here
there is just a few thornbushes, segade, and clumps of grass, and the occasional
lizard. As you glance around you realize the direct south is cut off by a

      <roomdescription>The great Spine rests silently to the west, the perfect image of a barren
wall. The grey mountains rise taller than all the spires you have seen in
the Three-fold, many of them capped with white or obscured by clouds. You
shiver at the thought of how cold it must be way up there, even though right
now the sun threatens to burn you to a crisp. The land here slopes back down
east from the foothills, and you can continue south along the line of mountains.

      <roomdescription>Here the cave ends in a wall of jagged, wet stone. Corpse moss grows up and
down the walls, streaking them with color that reflects what light enters here.
Some bones lie upon the floor - probably a lion's old meal. Something along the
wall catches your eye, and you brush the dust away to get a better look. An
ancient picture, probably from before the Breaking, of an ageless looking man
and woman holding a great city where people are singing around their crops
has been etched in.

As you look around you realize why the Shaarad call this Bent Valley Hold.
In all directions save south the valley walls run rather smoothly up, but in
the southern side the land looks like it folded over itself a few times before
dipping down even farther. In that dip you think you see some buildings or
yellowish-grey tents. Suddenly an Aiel warrior steps out from the ground, veil
raised. You better hope he knows you if you want to continue south.

few rather large areas of brown grass. The slopes are loose and hard to
climb. Suddenly something reflects the sun into your eyes and you turn to

further dip at the eastern edge of the valley, where you suspect a great

swear those ruts in the ground came from old wagons, probably merchants
traveling to Shara and Cairhien. All about you tufts of brown grass poke
up, slightly covered with a yellowish dust the hot wind has kicked up.
A nearby segade leans towards you, it's sharp prongs seeming to reach out.
All around you is nothing more than the same desert.

a very narrow slit in the ground. Peeking down you realize it drops a good
hundred spans. To both the east and west the apparant ravine under you
widens into something to large to step over; a faded path even leads down
to the eastern part. Everywhere else you see only the sparsely vegetated
waste land.

      <roomdescription>This valley is actually an extension of a long ravine to the west, like a
quick widening before it falls away to the empty space of a huge cliff.
After you stop staring out at the magnificent view east you realize a
multitude of sandy buildings and tents populate the edge and walls of the
ravine - the Hold of the Miagoma Clan. Emboldened, you stride forward and
suddenly feel a spear in your side. A young, strong Aiel has detached from
the ground and is prepared to kill you if he does not know you. You could
always take the paths back out of the ravine.

      <roomdescription>The land here juts out at odd angles, barren rock lying half-hazardly on
top of each other. It reminds you of building blocks that had been knocked
over by an unruly child. Some of the stone has become the home to a bluish
moss; in other areas clumps of dried grass and thornbushes create a dotted
carpet over the clay. You cannot see very far in any direction because of
the sheer number of sharp hills and loose rock formations, but you imagine
everything nearby is about the same.

of segade mixed with needleburr. The ground underfoot gives way quite
often, your footprints left in the yellow sand. Looking closer you can see
other animals that have passed by. One reminds you of a very large cat.
Wonder if it is dangerous? You can head off in any direction over other
ridges similar in angle to the one looming above.

anything nearby, and only know the Waste is beyond this lake of grain is

The sun appears to only allow light in part of the time, keeping the area

realize they are in fact cattle, moving slowly to avoid too much heat. A
few small buildings rest to one side, proving this area is a sort of ranch

the area becomes more interesting. Travelling due east is impossible due to

      <roomdescription>This is the southern-most point on the hill of Chaendaer. A back path
appears to follow down and around the foothills of the Spine of the World,
and exit out just south of the Jangai Pass into the wetlands. A few Aiel,
mostly Dawn Runners and younger spears, are preparing to journey out to
either Cairhien or Caemlyn and join their Societies there. If you so
choose, you may travel with them.
\c02The party facing northwest is headed for Cairhien, while the party facing
east is looking to jog to Caemlyn.\c00

      <roomdescription>The first thing noticeable about this tent is the almost constant trail of thin
smoke rising up and out of the hole at the peak. Beaten hides cover the floor,
and numerous furs hang on the sides to better insulate the heat. A workbench
too ornate to have been created in the Three-fold Land has been set to one
side, all sorts of tools lined up on it. A forge dominates the center, fire
glowing quietly inside. A copper bucket of water sits next to it, a leather
bag filled with what looks to be dung next to that. The smell of sweat and
melting metal permeates everything, escaping through the tent flap in the east.

      <roomdescription>You are in a relatively unfurnished room. There is a small mattress
the back of the room, with one pillow and a thin blanket upon it.
You see a small desk on your right as you enter with a table lamp
upon it. There are no other objects on the table and it looks unused.
In fact the whole room seems not to have been used for a long while.
