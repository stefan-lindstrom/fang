      <roomdescription>You find yourself in a well &amp;Yl&amp;Wi&amp;Yt &amp;nand somewhat large room. Three &amp;Yt&amp;Wo&amp;Yrc&amp;yhe&amp;ws&amp;n
surround it and a wide &amp;ypost&amp;n in the middle, where a piece of paper with
some writing has been attached. All around there are &amp;Yb&amp;ya&amp;Yr&amp;yr&amp;Ye&amp;yl&amp;Ys&amp;n and rope
scattered about and leaning against a large oak desk along the back wall.
The barrels nearest that have been overturned for seating, papers strewn
across both them and the desktop.

      <roomdescription>The sky is full of vibrant colors as the sun shines down on the weathered wood
of the deck of the ship. Each board is placed so tightly against the next that
it seems to be one large slab of wood making the raker. Saltiness is pungent
in the air as the wind blows mist from the rising waves that gently rock
the boat in the water.

      <roomdescription>The soft sea breeze is more noticeable up here and the sails flap in the
distance. The wood planks under your feet are worn from the constant salt in
the air, though they are still as smooth as they were when the ship was made.
A rope ladder leads downwards to the deck below and two thin ropes mark a
walkway to the rigging to the west.

    <roombasic title="The Main Cabin" vnum="1103" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>The main cabin is long and thin, about the size of the foredeck in overall mass
and length. There is a semi-comfortable bed along the back wall, affixed
tightly to the side of the hull so it doesn&apos;t rock and sway across the floor.
The bed is at least large enough for two people, if not more. There is a
large clothes chest at its foot, also nailed down. The lanterns hanging from
the ceiling swing lazily from the reverberations of muffled feet walking above.

      <roomdescription>The deck continues from the east, becoming more cluttered with rope as it
leads to the high mast. The wood underfoot is smooth but weathered from
many people daily walking around and readying the ship. Seagulls squack
loudly above as they swoop about the sails that all but block wind from
bothering you here below.

      <roomdescription>You stand on a smooth and very oiled rope that swings back and forth a little
in the wind.  The sea gulls fly overhead squacking loudly right above you.
The sails all around you and the main post of the ship farther west both
effectively stop any other progress but back east.

    <roombasic title="The Foredeck" vnum="1106" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>The front of the ship is bustling with people walking to and fro from the
back of the ship to the front. Ropes and pulleys litter the ground here as
well as patches of cloth and scrubbing brushes. The salty sea water splashes up
against the bow of the boat as it bobs here more noticeably. Seagulls rest
on the mast above you while eager deckhands try to shoo them away with rags
and pieces of torn sail.

    <roombasic title="The Cargo Hold" vnum="1107" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>The dim light down in the cargo hold is brightened slightly by the lantern
hanging by the hatch. The ramp that goes up to the deck is smooth but not
oily like the rest of the ship, due to animals often kept here, their
unmistakeable smell wafting about.  There are many crates on either side of
the walkway, arranged so that people can walk around with ease when looking
for something.

    <roombasic title="A Hallway" vnum="1108" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>This is a long hallway separated by a locked wooden door banded with steel.
The smell of the animals farther in the hold is masked by the wood. It is
obvious that the door hasn&apos;t been opened in awhile since the musk of dust
permeates the air instead, though the dust itself doesn&apos;t seem to appear on
the wood of the floor or either of the two doors.

    <roombasic title="A Cell" vnum="1109" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>This cell is large and very well taken care of for being a cell.  It is
comfortable up to a point, with a soft but serviceable bed almost large
enough for two people if they pressed together.  A wash basin rests next
to the bed and a few books are strewn on the floor as well.  There is
nothing else in the room, and it looks like it hasn&apos;t been used recently.

    <roombasic title="A Cell" vnum="1110" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>This cell is much smaller than the one to the north of the hallway. The bed
can barely fit one person and can&apos;t really be called a bed at all since it
is a piece of wood covered with a thin blanket to keep the splinters from the
skin of someone that lays down on it. The sheet used is worn and very tattered.
The only other thing in the room is a water basin with surprisingly clean
water in it.

    <roombasic title="A Smaller Cargo Hold For Animals" vnum="1111" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>The smell of animals as well as hay and feeding supplies assail your senses as
you enter this part of the Hold. There are two stalls meant to hold horses and
several smaller roped-off stalls for sheep and the like.  Above you, cleared
out of the way, are buckets and grooming supplies as well as halters and other
such things for all animals the WaveSong might need to bring aboard.

      <roomdescription>The long plank to the dock below is made from three boards that are tightly
roped together, and glued to make sure they do not come apart easy.  The waves
lap gently at the underside of the plank leaving it wet.

      <roomdescription>When you enter this room from up on the deck you notice it is almost completely
empty. No bigger than a hollow in size, there is a hallway branching off
and going deeper into the ship, parallel but behind the cargo holds. The
edges of doors can be seen farther along, while a wooden ladder leads up
to the deck.

    <roombasic title="The Open Area Narrows" vnum="1114" zone="11">
      <roomdescription>Here the hollow narrows into a short hallway. Doors made of rough but
sturdy wood flank you, but each is sealed with a band of metal. These
bands appear well cared for, polished to a mirror shine to keep rust from
forming on all but the edges where the salty air takes a daily bite out
of them. It appears the only way out is back the way you came.
