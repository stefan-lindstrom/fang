Inside the walls~
You have just walked past the walls that surround the mansion of \c08House \c11di'Matera\c00 and you notice that the courtyard is much bigger than it seems from the outside. \c23A broad darkgrey
marble stair\c00 lead up to the great double doors that lead inside the \c01mansion,\c00 which seems to be buildt of \c01red granite.\c00 The two \c23thick pillars\c00 which holds the roof that covers the stairs are of the same material as the stairs. A gardener is tending the \c02few trees\c00 still alive and a messenger is talking to one of the two guards posted at each side of the doors.
\c10 *OOC* This is a private mansion, please do not use it without Loke's permisson\c00

Hall with a broad double Staircase.~
\c00You stand in the highceilinged hall which is topped with a \c01r\c08e\c01d\c00 glass dome that spreads
a \c01soft red glow\c00 over the room. A large staircase starts at each sidewall and leads up
to a balcony looking room above. On the walls beneath the staircase hangs the portraits
of all the old lords of the house and you notice a paintng that looks very new, it's
\c03go\c10l\c03d\c10e\c03n\c00 frame not so dull as the others. Straight ahead is two large \c13glass doors\c00
etched with the sign of house di'Matera, a \c03go\c10l\c03d\c10e\c03n\c00 \c10st\c03a\c10r\c00 inside a 
\c08red\c00 triangle with it's point down.

\c09The garden\c00~
\c02You find yoursef in a surprisingly \c09green and lush garden\c02 and you guess it's due to the \c04spring \c11gu\c13sh\c11ing\c02 forth from a collection of \c23rocks\c02  in the far corner just inside the walls, the \c11water\c02 flows in a small \c13stream\c02 across the garden and dissapears under the wall on the opposite side. Short \c09trees and bushes\c02 lines the walls and and inside a dense bower you find a \c01large stone table lined with
stone benches all made of red granite.\c00

\c08The Library\c00~
\c01As you reach the top of the stairs you see that the walls here are lined with bookcases holding not only books but also\c10 souvenirs\c01 from all over the world like a\c12 seafolk porcelain vase\c01 and many other precious things one enjoys looking at. You notice that from up here one has a very good view of what happens in the hall below and as you lean against the dark wooden railing you find that a large \c03splinter\c01 has been broken away from it. There are doors leading in all directions but y
ur interest is captured by the polished, carved wooden door that leads north.\c00

\c10A Secret Room\c00~
This room is sparsly but finely decorated as if the one hiding in here should be as comfortable as possible. On the floor is a \c08thick red carpet\c00 that should silence any sounds made by the inhabitant and on the wall is just one small \c13window \c00letting through the afternoon light. Along the walls are a bed and a small desk. You guess it cant be very fun hiding in here for a long time.

Loke's Bedroom~
\c00This is a room is dominated by a large \c11canopy\c00 bed which is covered with a soft
\c08red\c00 and \c11blue\c00 blanket and a  heap of silkcovered pillows. Two large \c13windows\c00 let
in the soft afternoon light. The walls are covered with tapestries showing beautiful
scenes from the andoran nature except for the space occupied by a large \c01fi\c08r\c10e\c03pl\c01a\c08c\c10e\c00
in which an unlit fire has been prepared for some time. The skin of a large \c23black\c00 bear
covers the floor infront of the \c01fi\c08r\c10e\c03pl\c01a\c08c\c10e\c00 and on the opposite side of the room you
can glance into a bathroom made in the same \c23grey\c00 marble as the front stairs.
Wouldn't \c10you\c00 want to live like this?
