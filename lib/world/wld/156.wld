      <roomdescription>A group of women walk down this street, just as wide here
as the main road through Daghain and nearly as busy. The
women stroll down the side of the street as though they
do not notice the crowd around them or the bustle of the
merchants propositioning them to buy goods of all sort.
The paving on this road looks well-maintained, and the
buildings look to be in good shape. The road here continues
east and west, parallel to the main road through Daghain,
and this one appears to be active enough, with taverns and
shops up and down its length.

the building and pours water from a small pitcher over
the plants, then places her hands on the windowsill and
leans outside to look over the street. She is shaded from
the day's hot sun by an awning over the window, but nearly
everywhere else the heat is inescapable. The road here

      <roomdescription>Two wildflowers are growing from the stones that pave
the street. They are remarkably unscathed considering
the amount of traffic that constantly moves down this
street. A few children skip down the side of the road,
one of them flipping a copper in his hand as though he
were king of this street for a time. The road here

      <roomdescription>This road is fairly well-paved although some stones
have come up here and there, presumably where a cart
wheel or a horse hoof have struck a weak spot. A few
children are playing on the road up the street a bit,
though for the most part the road is empty and the
buildings quiet. It seems life in this city revolves
around the main road, or at least that it does not
revolve around this small road.

erected here. It is formed by a large tent which extends
a bit into the road but does not block the way for most

      <roomdescription>Here at a large intersection near the northern center of
town, several different vendors cry their products, which
are carefully arranged to best attract the eyes of potential
customers passing by. A small shop on the southeastern
corner of the intersection sells tobacco, from the sign
above the door. Like most of the signs advertising shops
in this city, it is entirely pictoral, an exquisitely
detailed wooden sign carved with a pipe and tin of tobacco.
The shop gives off the faint, musky odor reminiscient of
a smoking room.

      <roomdescription>This large street running east-west through the southern
part of Daghain sees its fair share of travellers, though
many of them stay on the main road. Still, those seeking a
place to shop or to stay for the night often find themselves
exploring Daghain and its variety of inns, shops and taverns
as a break from their journey. You can easily distinguish
between the travellers and the people native to this small
city: the townspeople look energetic and ready to take on
their day whatever it might bring, while most of the people
travelling look as though an unexpected wind could push them
over, at which point they would be unable to stand back up.
At the same time they look expectant somehow, anticipating
their destination and whatever it will bring.

here at this intersection. This east-west road runs
parallel to the main road through Daghain, and is nearly
as busy as the main road in most sections. On the corner
to the northeast, a bakery is churning out the intensely
sweet smells of honeycakes and potato bread, as well as
pies and tarts made with fruits of all kinds. On the 
northwest corner sits a building of just one story, a
quaint-looking place.

to be trotting lazily on his way, though he jumps at the

Occasionally a child tosses him a crumb or a scrap, or an
adult nonchalantly drops a morsel which the dog immediately
snatches and takes with him down an alley or between two
buildings.

building. It is an inn that looks as if it has been carved
to fit around the curve of the road. There are two entrances
to \c13The Maiden's Hand\c00, apparently to both of the common rooms.
This is the outskirts of the older part of the city, meaning
that the streets will become much more winding as you walk
or ride to the north and east. The road continues south and
west and eventually joins up with the main road through this
city which serves as a thoroughfare for those travelling
between Cairhien and Tar Valon, although its inhabitants try
to promote their own identity to snatch the business of the
travellers as they pass through.

It is probably an apartment building like the one just
to the west here must be: a tall, thin building with
several floors, each one with an identical balcony. The
first floor could be a shop, although the door is closed

From time to time here some horses are sold, but for the most

Several individual stables stand to the north, opposite the

      <roomdescription>A bit further south this wide street meets the main road
through Daghain. This lane is paved, though there is a
thin layer of earth distributed over the rather large
paving stones on this less-travelled part of the street.
A few carts occasionally make their way up this road,
throwing up small amounts of dust which have since layered
the young trees that grow along the sides of the road. The
apartments and shops that line the street have that small
layer of dust along their windowsills, but are mostly clean
otherwise.

      <roomdescription>Inside the tavern, the air is damp and only slightly musty, yet
it is a pleasant smell, signifying refreshments and the laughter
of entertainment. Gaeldil, the proprietor of the establishment,
sits behind a large, thick, darkened wood counter polishing mugs
as he watches the crowd, or the lack thereof, depending on the
time of day. It is not clear that Gaeldil himself does anything
other than sit at his stool and polish glasses, for he has many
a servant girl bustling around serving customers and providing
witty responses to customer comments between the songs of the
performers. In fact, it is regarded as a sign of status in the
city, or at least among those who frequent the tavern, for
Gaeldil to descend from his stool and welcome you in.

      <roomdescription>The road that splits off the main road through Daghain is
well-paved and fairly wide, enough for a cart and two horses
to pass abreast. There are buildings to either side, their
walls worn a bit with time but still well-kept. To the west,
a window in the side of the building gives away the occupants:
it is a tavern of sorts, and when the window is open one only
has to be close enough to hear the noise coming from inside it
to know that. To the east is The Shepherd's Light, an inn of
good reputation whose customers return again and again because
of the good food and prices.

      <roomdescription>The lightly finished wooden walls combine with the rustic carved
tables and high-backed chairs here to give The Shepherd's Light an
antique feel. White swept-back curtains on the windows indicate
the presence of a woman somewhere, and you spot her as she backs
her way out of the kitchen door, holding a platter of roasted
chickens encircled by fresh, hot bread and a few goblets of wine.
Still, her presence around here does not mean the place is refined
or cultured; drunkenness is of course permitted, though not coarse
offensiveness. Patrons often gather here to shout obnoxious stories,
repeated over and over again when they have had enough ale to forget
that it was told the night before. Or to enjoy the musical or comedic
performances, which are varied and usually of quality.

The entire room seems to be engineered around providing

closed it is nearly impossible to hear the rather loud
commotion that is normal in the common room. A slightly
smaller door leads north to the kitchen, as is obvious from
the chefs that come and go through that door to serve the
clients dining in this room.

several different vendors cry their products, which are
carefully arranged to best attract the eyes of potential

in this city, it is entirely pictoral, an exquisitely
detailed wooden sign carved with a pipe and tin of tobacco.
The shop gives off the faint, musky odor reminiscient of
a smoking room.

travel through this smaller city, to reach the great city. A bit
further down the road toward Daghain, a small tavern sits on the
edge of the road, and looks to be popular, even during the day.

      <roomdescription>Pleasant smells waft from the open window of the building on
the south side of the street here, an inn called The Wine 
Fountain. Like most inns, the innkeeper always has something
cooking, and this does its job in attracting customers. Across
the street from the inn, a large white building with solid
oak doors seems to be an important building to the town,
exactly what its purpose is is not quite clear.

      <roomdescription>You find yourself standing in front of the entrance to The
Wine Fountain inn, a cheery-looking building with a set of
dark grey stone steps leading up to a large oaken door, the
handle worn in with a vague handprint of the many customers
who have used it through its years of existence. In fact, the
street widens here as it makes way around both sides of an
empty fountain. It was once a light grey marble fountain, with
a simple carving of a nondescript shape which spouted liquid,
obviously a burgundy liquid, from the stains that trail down
the spout to line the inside of the fountain. Wine, perhaps?

large side street meets the main road through daghain in a
somewhat organized mesh of carts and horses and travelers
on foot. Many horses and carts are stopped here for a short
rest while their owners visit the smithy just to the north
for some repairs or to place a quick order. The blacksmith
must be busy, because from time to time you see one of his
assistants rushing out the front or side doors, on some rush
errand or another for the master.

street, advertising his goods with short, punctuated yells in
his trademark voice that carries through the streets and seems
to vibrate the windows in places. The fruit itself looks fairly
fresh, for this weather, though no doubt better merchandise
could be found in Tar Valon to the west, where they have the
advantage of a larger market, among other things.

Daghain, no doubt going to one of the medium-sized streets
parallel to the main road. Looking north up the street, you
see a mule or a short horse tied to a post outside a two-story
building, looking a bit bored as it chews on something its
master has given it, or something it just found. There is little
action up this street otherwise, but on the main road there is
a fairly steady stream of traffic, from the townspeople to the
travelers who come through here on their way to Tar Valon.

more promising as far as merchandise and entertainment is
concerned. You could always ask; the people here seem friendly

horses and carts is not slowed dramatically. Several vendors
contribute their share of volume to the finite space available,
advertising their wares despite a few annoyed looks from those
trying to get through from one side to the other. Most of these
travelers are going to Tar Valon, which is just to the west of
Daghain, across the river Erinin, or have already been there
and are returning to their homes via the Cairhien - Tar Valon

paving and widens to become a well-packed and thus only
slightly dusty dirt road, amazingly smooth considering the
amount of traffic it receives, being the northwestern end of
the road between Tar Valon and Cairhien. Most of the travelers
at this point on the road have a smile for the people they pass,
either because they are nearing the end of their journey and
anticipate what awaits them, or because they are just starting
out and so are not wearied yet by the heat and drought that
pervades nowadays.

of the shop by its beauty, a red silk dress embroidered up
the sides with a train of birds flitting around vines which
conceal the buttons to the bodice. The neckline is fairly
conservative, though it shows a bit of wooden skin on the
model who wears it, to be expected given the color and
extravagance of the rest of the dress. Other dresses on
similar models stand in corners of the room, while the most
elegant dresses arrange themselves in the windows for the
passersby to see. There is not a speck of dust to be found
anywhere in this shop, and the dresses all seem to be of
fine quality, finished or unfinished.

      <roomdescription>Two large counters line opposite walls of this large kitchen,
built to handle large amounts of food. On a set of hooks
above the western counter, which is split in the middle by
a door to the stables, a set of ladles and spatulas hang,
moving about slightly as though they have just been disturbed.
Two assistant chefs, perhaps the daughters of the family that
owns The Wine Fountain Inn, bustle about the kitchen preparing
an assortment of smaller dishes. From here doors lead into
the common room and the dining room, as well as the door
bisecting the counter to the stables.

      <roomdescription>This narrow alleyway passes between a large four-story
building to the east and a wider, more sturdy-looking
two-story building to the west. Between the buildings
to the east, you catch sight of a rat scurrying into the
shadows. This smaller road connects the main road through
Daghain to the roads parallel to it. Like this one, most
of these roads are almost small enough to be alleys,
though some of them are almost large enough to be main
streets themselves.

apartments are fairly varied in design aside from their
similar width. Some have obviously been here since the
city was built or rebuilt, while others appear to be
much newer and in slightly better shape.

the side of the road here. Probably lost by some child

runs east and west, parallel to the main road through
Daghain, which lies to the south. This road is connected
to the main road via several small lanes and streets which
wind around inns, shops and apartments.

Occasionally a child tosses him a crumb or a scrap, or an
adult nonchalantly drops a morsel which the dog immediately
snatches and takes with him down an alley or between two
buildings.

      <roomdescription>This large street running east-west through the southern
part of Daghain sees its fair share of travellers, though
many of them stay on the main road. Still, those seeking a
place to shop or to stay for the night often find themselves
exploring Daghain and its variety of inns, shops and taverns
as a break from their journey. You can easily distinguish
between the travellers and the people native to this small
city: the townspeople look energetic and ready to take on
their day whatever it might bring, while most of the people
travelling look as though an unexpected wind could push them
over, at which point they would be unable to stand back up.
At the same time they look expectant somehow, anticipating
their destination and whatever it will bring.

      <roomdescription>The hallway continues a bit further south from here,
though the three rooms at the end of the hall are
occupied, and from the looks of the guards standing
just outside two of them, their occupants do not
wish to be disturbed. At the very end of the hall
there is a small end table holding a bowl and pitcher
made of porcelain, quite delicate and a bit out of
place. It looks to be decorative, and perhaps in
better times it serves as a vase for flowers.

      <roomdescription>To the west, the walls of Tar Valon stretch into the sky in all
their ogier-built majesty. To the east, a white bridge, beautiful
in its own right as it spans the river Erinin with grace, standing
despite what would seem to be inadequate support. There is usually
a large amount of traffic crossing the bridge from Daghain to Tar
Valon and vice-versa, and seen from this point, the far end of the
bridge almost looks like a mass of small animals scurrying across
a porcelain plate. Still, it is beautiful, especially with the
city of Tar Valon and the wide river Erinin as a backdrop.

      <roomdescription>The white bridge that spans the river Erinin from Tar Valon to the
city of Daghain reaches its highest point here, curving gracefully
down to either side. To the east, the city of Daghain sprouts up
from the riverbank and spreads further east. To the west, Tar Valon
reaches up from the opposite bank, the White Tower stretching into
the sky as though it owns what wispy clouds manage to form themselves
these days. Below, the wide river flows at its own pace, its currents
familiar to the boats that travel on it every day and night.

      <roomdescription>What starts as a smooth white path slopes gradually upward into a
bridge that stretches from the edge of the city of Daghain, across
the river Erinin, toward the towering city of Tar Valon. The bridge
is high enough at its peak for any boat to pass under, and several
people crossing the bridge appear to have stopped there to get a
view of the scenery; what with the river below and the ogier-built
Tar Valon to the west, it is indeed a grand sight, especially
impressive to the weary travelers who have obviously come great
distances to see the White Tower.

do not come from this room but rather from the room behind
the door to the north. Even with that door closed and all
attention on the finished products in this room, the sounds
of the smithy which makes these fine weapons and crafts can
be heard from the street, which makes them quite loud in this
room, with just one wall to separate them from you. The noise
alternates between a rhythmic clanging and the frantic hissing
of steam billowing up from hot metal plunging into cold water.
The owner of the shop brawnily but quickly moves from one room
to the other, but is always sure to be in this room when a
customer comes along.

      <roomdescription>Entering the first common room of this inn, you notice
a delicious nonspecific smell that seems to permeate the
entirety of the large room. The origin of these smells
is most certainly the food served to the customers here,
rushed from kitchen to table by several serving girls
who seem as impervious to the smell as they are to the
stray hands which the men sitting at various tables
allow to drift. A large fireplace on the east wall
ringed by a bench and mantle of stone nestles a cozy
fire which warms the room, though the heat is largely
unnecessary in this weather. The mantle supports a rather
large collection of books flanked on either end by twin
smallish gold harps. A set of wooden stairs lead up to the
second floor, finished in a dark lacquer.

      <roomdescription>This is a quaint little room in \c06The \c13Maiden's Hand\c00, where
the customers can relax and put up their feet with a mug
of ale or goblet of wine, or sit down at a table for a
pleasant conversation. A rustic wooden table marks the center
of a ring made by three large cushioned chairs and a loveseat
covered with old knit blankets of various patterns. This
common room of is just a bit larger than the other common
room is, and has a slightly different feel to it. It seems
as though it is divided into two parts, one part cozy living
room and the other, a more typical atmosphere of chairs and
tables, and a great deal of food and drink - less food and
more drink. Some of the tables are host to games of cards or
dice, and from those chairs occasionally rise a shout or cheer,
depending on how the game is progressing for the chair's occupant.

      <roomdescription>The head cook glances up at your entrance disapprovingly just
before returning her attention to the bowl in which she is
whipping up a batter for honeycakes, or something similar. Why
did she just frown at you like that? Likely she is upset by the
distraction, but could it be something else? Perhaps she is
feeling unappreciated. Come to think of it, many of the women
in inns like this spend all day cooking delicious (or perhaps
just average) food for their customers, and at the end of the
day they get little more than a mere nod for it. That seems
unfair; surely something could be done for her. The cook snaps
at one of her assistants, who rushes hurriedly to scoop a
ladleful of stew into a large bowl, slice some bread and lather
it with butter, and run through the door to the first common
room. The cook then turns back to her batter and begins filling
her baking tins with it, smiling and chuckling softly to herself.
Then again, maybe she likes her job.

lanterns placed onto the walls on either side of the doors

the hallway lead to rooms of varying sizes, a few fit for
nobility but most sized and furnished for a customer of
average means. There are usually a few empty rooms in this
inn at any time of year because while Daghain itself is close
to Tar Valon, \c06The \c13Maiden's Hand\c00 is not on the main road but
rather the eastern end of a northern road through this busy
city. There is little traffic in this hallway, except for the
occasional customer. Still, the rooms are of good quality
and the prices low.

      <roomdescription>The walls of this room are painted white, and decorated with
numerous paintings and a large tapestry of an ocean scene,
hanging over a four-poster bed covered with a soft white
quilt and half a dozen blue and white pillows. Against one
wall is a washstand made of oak and intricately carved to
look as if the legs were made of wooden vines, sitting on
which is a porcelain washbasin painted with foamy blue waves.
Hanging above this is a large circular mirror, showing the
reflection of the large oak wardrobe sitting against the
opposite wall. The wall opposite the bed is nearly all made
of glass from a pace or so off the plushly carpeted floor,
a huge window that juts out from the rest of the wall so as
to form a cushioned seat, giving a view of the street below.

A stained mahogany chest rests against the far wall, next

green embroidered with a simple white pattern, matches
the alternating concentric ovals in the thick rug. Resting
against the wall to the west is a soft white sitting chair
and an antique carved round end table. Above the chair is
a set of shelves set into the wall, of a plain lightly-
finished oak, holding numerous decorative jars and bottles
of colored blown glass.

      <roomdescription>A small bedroom with a bed for two people that leaves
relatively little empty floor space, although it is larger
than some of the smallest rooms in this quaint little inn.
An armoire, a small table equipped with a pitcher and bowl
that takes up nearly the whole surface of the table, and a
desk equipped with paper, pen and ink, take up the rest of
the space in this room. The pitcher is large, made of fairly
inexpensive painted ceramic, though it is quite prettily
painted. Overall the room is quite comfortable, with a cozy
feel, though certainly anyone of noble birth would reject it
as a room merely fit for a servant. A few small paintings of
various scenes add to the rustic air of the room.

thick walls to the north and east. On white-painted walls several
hooks are attached, on all of which hang different kinds of herbs
and roots, some in the process of drying, some already dried. Even
from outside the door the smell of herbs was strong; now, the smell
is almost enough to cause lightheadedness. On a wooden counter up
against the west wall are a series of stone mortars and pestles,
most of which are permanently stained a brownish-green color where
they have had the most exposure. It appears that whatever concoction
you need can be made on request here, and although Emelda will not
promise that the final product will be pleasing to taste, she does
guarantee its effectiveness.
