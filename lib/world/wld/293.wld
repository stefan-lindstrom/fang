The north wall also has a door that leads towards the north, resting
behind a bar that lines that entire side of the room with a few feet
between the wall and the bar itself for the innkeeper and serving girls to
walk.  \c10Wooden\c00 shelves are mounted on the wall behind the bar, filled with
different types of spirits that seem to come from all over world.  One
other door also leads out to the east and from the odor that wafts in
whenever the door is open, it is obvious that it leads out towards the
stable.

to provide abundant \c03l\c07i\c03g\c07h\c03t\c00, they are turned down so only a soft, warm \c10glow\c00
fills the area.  A long, rectangular table rests in the middle of the
room, situated only about a foot or so off the floor.  Large, fluffy
pillows, that are \c23dark \c04blue\c00 to match the wallpaper, sit in several spots
around the table.  Place settings have been set upon the \c03wooden\c00 surface,

around as the door opens up into this room.  Several serving girls move in
and out of this room on a regular basis, usually leaving with their arms
full of food for the patrons of the inn.  One person seems to stand out, a
rather large, \c23dark\c00 haired woman that wears a soft \c02green\c00 dress that is
covered by a pristine \c07white\c00 apron.  She gives out orders to all those
around here without once raising her voice, yet everyone seems to hear her
despite the noise level.  Pots and pans hang from a rack that rests on a
rather large chain, swinging slightly from where it is mounted on the
ceiling.  The chain leads down and seems to be fastened to a hook that
sits on the wall next to the doorway leading into the pantry.  Another
opening that leads out of the room is a trap door leading down into the
wine cellar.

it lines the wall opposite from the walkway, sliced and whole loaves of

sugar, along with salted sides of meat from all different sorts of
animals.

Two fluffy pillow sit at the top of the bed, the shams made of the same

posts rise up from each corner of the bed.  Whispers of pale, gauzy cloth
twirl around each post, from one to the other and again to another, till
all are intertwined with the fabric and it acts as a makeshirt curtain all
around the bed.  A \c03cr\c07e\c03am\c00 colored, crocheted comforter rests upon the top
of the bed, a multitude of large, fluffy pillows sitting at the headboard.
Right next to the bed is a single table, round and covered with the same
gauzy material that is wrapped around the posts.  A small teaset rests
upon the top, the \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00 tray holding a teapot, two cups and saucers, and
a variety of containers for honey, cream and sugar.  On the wall opposite
from the bed, is a small vanity made from a \c23dark\c00, \c01cherry\c00 stained wood.  
The silvery surface of the mirror reflects back to the bed and the soft
curtains that surround it.  \c23Si\c07lv\c23er\c00 covered combs, brushes and a hand
mirrors rest beside various sized containers.

A brightly colored, plaid comforter of \c02greens\c00, \c03yellows\c00 and \c07whites\c00 sits
upon the bed with one side pulled back as if ready for someone to occupy
it.  Two, fluffy pillows rest at the head of the bed and a small,
crocheted comforter resting at the foot for those cold nights.  A chest,
made from \c01c\c03e\c01d\c03a\c01r\c00, rests on the floor at the foot of the bed.  On the top of
the table, that sits next to the bed, is a large bouquet of \c05f\c06l\c04o\c07w\c04e\c06r\c05s\c00.  The

The sides of the roof slope down towards the walls of the room, making
standing to any one side a bit difficult for anyone of more than average
height.  In one corner of the room, resting upon the dusty floor, is a
pallet with a small pillow.  The blanket made of coarse wool and \c23dark\c00 \c02green\c00

money for a regular room or midnight trysts among the employees of the

every \c03wooden\c00 table.  Not that the clientele seems to mind any.  Men of all
sizes sit at tables across the room, their attire matching that of the
decour of the inn.  A bar lines almost the whole entire east side of the
room, a few of the men laughing uproariously as they clutch their precious
drinks in their grubby hands.  The man behind the bar, presumably the
innkeeper, watches the room with a \c06cool\c00 gaze for any trouble.  The aroma
of food seems to waft in from a door near the bar on the east side of the

stairs that lead up to the second floor.

      <roomdescription>This room is slightly better than the last, a bit larger in size and much
cleaner.  The bed is centered along the eastern wall with a large oil
painting hung over top.  \c07White\c00 sheets, again, adorn the down mattress of
the bed with a light \c10b\c23r\c10o\c23w\c10n\c00 comforter folded at the foot.  Two, circular
tables rest upon either side of the bed.  One holds a washbasin of \c07white\c00
ceramic and the other a vase of wilted \c05f\c06l\c04o\c07w\c04e\c06r\c05s\c00.  Another variation from
the other room is the wardrobe that rests on the western wall directly
across from the foot of the bed.  A deep \c01mahoghany\c00 color, it stands about
six foot tall with two doors that open outward.

      <roomdescription>A loud clanging sound fills the room, almost as overwhelming as the \c01heat\c00
that comes from several forges situated through out the room.  A large man
raises a hammer over and over again above a raw piece of \c23metal\c00 that will
perhaps become the blade of a sword.  His arms bulge each time the hammer
falls down, a \c03l\c23e\c03a\c23t\c03h\c23e\c03r\c00 apron protecting the front part of his body from the
warmth.  Other men, a bit younger than the one hammering scurry about,
doing various chores like cleaning.  Three barrels or assorted types of
\c04liquid\c00 sit close to the forge, the man pausing every few moments to dip
the \c23metal\c00 into one or all of the barrels before continuing with the
shaping of his masterpiece.  Besides the main entrance, there is only one
door that leads from the back of the room.

surface.  The only other piece of furniture in this room is a small desk
that sits right next to the bed.  Several sheets of paper lie scattered
across the wooden surface in obvious disarray.  They appear to be rough
sketches of gate entrances and other metallic devices that can be made.

together by hue and by the type of fabric, with the least expensive near
the door and the more expensive types of silk or linen towards the back.
There is also a display case near the western side of the room, different
types of jewelry held within velvet lined boxes.  There is a desk near the
back of the room, with a ledger and inkwell sitting on the top.

nails, backpacks, pieces of canvas and other common household goods.  
While the shelves on the left side of the shop hold bags of flour, sugar
and rice.  Other dried food, such as traveling rations and seeds could
also be found.  A short, dark haired man stands near the back of the

leads the way back to a square fountain, made of &amp;Wwhite&amp;n marble.  In the
middle of the cool waters of the fountain, a statue in the form a &amp;Kb&amp;kl&amp;Ka&amp;kc&amp;Kk&amp;n,
marble fish rises from the crystal clear liquid.  A gush of cool, clear
&amp;bw&amp;ca&amp;bt&amp;ce&amp;br&amp;n sprouts up into the air from its mouth. Wrought &amp;Kiron&amp;n benches,
painted white to match the fountain, are placed around the fountain to
provide a place to sit and relax.  Beyond the fountain, lies perfectly
square, manicured beds of &amp;Mf&amp;bl&amp;Co&amp;Ww&amp;Ce&amp;br&amp;Ms&amp;n.  All types and colors of fauna are held

been attached to the counter, fashioning a crude type of a display case.
Two women can be seen bustling around, moving things from the ovens to the
front display cases or from the ovens into boxes that are quickly handed
out to patrons that stand waiting.  Both women are short, dark haired with
dark eyes that glance at everyone as if they aren't what they appear to

this person or that, taking and filling orders.

front of the manor house, the cobblestones make a circle that leads back
out towards Market Street.  In the center of of the circle is a small
fountain with flowers planted around the base.  A small set of stairs lead
up to the double doors of the house, lion heads fastened upon their wooden
surface with a knocker hanging from the mouth of each.  There is a small
path, almost unnoticable, that leads around to the side of the house.  
Perhaps for servants or when goods are being delivered.

fireplace, a crocheted blanket resting over one of its arms.  The mantle
above the fireplace has \c03wooden\c00 frames that are filled with sketches of
people, young and old.  And sometimes placed between the sketches are
small figurines that have been carved from wood.  Other than the door that

      <roomdescription>In the kitchen of the &amp;rHeartwood&amp;n Inn, there always seems to be a flurry of
movement.  The entire back wall is hidden behind a counter, the counter
laden with different sizes and shapes of container.  Some of the
containers are labeled, such as &amp;wflour&amp;n, &amp;csugar&amp;n and &amp;rcinnamon&amp;n.  A large wood
stove sits on the southern wall, big enough to hold six burners.  A few
pots and pans are already cooking upon the top, creating a myriad of
smells that waft up into the air.  Over top of the stove is a wooden rack,
several pegs holding pots and pans that are not in use at the moment.  A
sturdy rope holds the rack up in the air, tied off to a hook that has been
placed near the doorframe of the pantry.

that appears to be for special guests only.  A large, round table sits in
the middle of the room with six chairs situated around it.  In the middle
of the dark, wooden surface is a large bouquet of \c05f\c04l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c04r\c05s\c00 . There are also
several lit candles that rest near but not too close to the flowers.  In
front of each chair at the table sits a place mat, a &amp;Wwhite&amp;n plate resting
upon each with silverware to the left and right.  A large fireplace is
situated on the backside of the room, above the mantle is a large
&amp;ypainting&amp;n.

all bright, cheery colors.  The bed, though on the smallish side, seems to
be comfortable as it is pushed up against the northern wall of this room.
A brightly colored, plaid comforter of \c02greens\c00, \c03yellows\c00 and \c07whites\c00 sits
upon the bed with one side pulled back as if ready for someone to occupy
it.  Two, fluffy pillows rest at the head of the bed and a small,
crocheted comforter resting at the foot for those cold nights.  A chest,
made from \c01c\c03e\c01d\c03a\c01r\c00, rests on the floor at the foot of the bed.  On the top of
the table, that sits next to the bed, is a large bouquet of \c05f\c06l\c04o\c07w\c04e\c06r\c05s\c00.  The

that is mounted upon the top.  A large bed is situated in the middle of
the wall to the right of the door, four wooden posts rising from each
corner.  The posts are carved with exquisite detail to show a \c02vine\c00
climbing its way up to the top, clinging to the \c10wooden\c00 surace.  Small
\c01rosebuds\c00 hide themselves within the leaves of the \c02vine\c00, peaking out every
so often at different spots on the post.  A light \c06blue\c00 comforter rests
upon the pillow-like surface of the bed, large \c07white\c00 flowers embroidered
in patches all over.  Two matching pillows rest upon the top and at the
foot of the bed is a chest that is closed for now.  To one side of the bed
is a small, round table covered with the same type of cloth that the
comforter is made out of, flowers and all.

      <roomdescription>Softly &amp;yl&amp;wi&amp;yt&amp;n lanterns are mounted on the walls all about the room, providing
a warm glow all around.  The intimate atmosphere of the room is enhanced
even more by the bed.  Centered along the south wall of those room, four
posts rise up from each corner of the bed.  Whispers of pale, gauzy cloth
twirl around each post, from one to the other and again to another, till
all are intertwined with the fabric and it acts as a makeshirt curtain all
around the bed.  A \c03cr\c07e\c03am\c00 colored, crocheted comforter rests upon the top
of the bed, a multitude of large, fluffy pillows sitting at the headboard.
Right next to the bed is a single table, round and covered with the same
gauzy material that is wrapped around the posts.  A small teaset rests
upon the top, the \c23si\c07lv\c23er\c00 tray holding a teapot, two cups and saucers, and
a variety of containers for honey, cream and sugar.  On the wall opposite
from the bed, is a small vanity made from a \c23dark\c00, \c01cherry\c00 stained wood.  
The silvery surface of the mirror reflects back to the bed and the soft
curtains that surround it.  \c23Si\c07lv\c23er\c00 covered combs, brushes and a hand
mirrors rest beside various sized containers.

rack is hanging from the ceiling, assorted pots and pans hanging from
wooden pegs to save on room.  A long wooden table takes up the entire
north wall of the kitchen, the surface covered with vegtables and fruits
in different bowls.  Under one side of the counter is a stack of fire
wood, obviously for replenishing the woodstove.

to be homemade.

embroidered with colorful \c05f\c04l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c04r\c05s\c00 to add a bit of decoration to the
otherwise plain room.  At the foot of the bed is a rocking chair, similar
to the one out in the living area except that this has a comfortable
looking cushion that rests in the seat.  Two cots are on the opposite side
of the wall from the Reader's bed, both sitting side by side.  This is
where the sick would come to sleep if they needed to be watched over.  
Sitting in between the two cots is a small table, a white ceramic wash
basin and a pitcher of water its only decorations. The only other
embellishment in the bedroom is a large wardrobe that sits to the left of
the doorway, its doors slightly ajar.

leaving only enough room for a doorway that apparently leads into the
kitchen.  The front of the bar is lined with three legged, wooden stools,
each stained a dark mahogany.  A jolly looking man, so thin that each
laugh shakes his whole body, stands behind the bar with a white dish
towel.  His dark hair peppered with strands of grey, a few lines around
his eyes appear as he smiles at those around him.  A set of stairs on the

talking almost impossible.  Spices line the shelves above a huge stove
over in the northern part of of this room.  Bubbling pans on top of the
stove seem to be the main source of the wonderful odors.  Men and women of
all sizes run around with plates or drinks that they either carry on
trays or in their hands.  Each wears a white apron around their waist and
a folded, white cloth over their left arm.  Only one person wears a full
length apron, a tall woman who is suprisingly slim considering her
profession.  She has long dark hair, carefully pulled back in a tight bun
at the nape of her neck and looks to be all business if the look on her
face is any evidence.  She waves that spoon around threateningly if
someone gets in her way or moves too slow.

hundred different mirrors are within their \c23s\c07i\c23l\c07v\c23e\c07r\c23y\c00 depths.

      <roomdescription>The door opens up into a spacious but rather simple room, with comfortable
furnishings.  It's similar in the way the other rooms are designed, with a
double bed that rests against the middle of the back wall straight out
from the door.  A somber, \c02green\c00 comforter rests upon the firm yet
comfortable surface of the bed.  The comforter is turned down on the upper
right corner, showing a pristine \c07white\c00 sheet underneath and two fluffy
pillows.  There is one large table in the upper left corner of the room
with a shelf underneath.  The shelf holds a large, white water basin and a
pitcher that is filled to the brim with water.  In the middle of the table
is a floral bouquet that seems to be made of \c05f\c04l\c06o\c07w\c06e\c04r\c05s\c00 that were just
picked.  Two chairs sit on either side of the table, that seems to serve
multiple purposes.

      <roomdescription>The soft \c03glow\c00 from a lantern is the only source of light in this room.  
The furnishings are simple like the rest of the inn but comfortable enough
for any who might stay here.  A single sized bed rests against the middle
of the far wall, two tables sitting to either side.  Upon one is the
lighted lantern, its flame dancing upon the oil drenched wicker. The
other is covered by a \c07white\c00 wash basin with a pitcher full of water beside
it.  There is a light \c06blue\c00 comforter upon the pillowy surface of the bed,
seems to be made from a heavy wool that will keep any chill from the bed's
occupant.  A matching throw rug had been placed upon the wooden floor, off
to one side of the bed.

version of the Sun Palace's.  The floor is made of bright gold and blue
checkers that continues down the long hallway.  Several doorways can be
seen on either side of the corridor.  There is a set of wide stairs that
lead up into the upper part of the house, the rail made of a rich mahogany
wood.  Sconces are mounted along the wall all down the hall to provide
abundant light, the flames flickering merrily on their wicks.

sconces continue to provide abundant light as they are mounted upon the
finely panelled walls.  On the eastern side of the wall, a door leads into
sitting room that is decorated just as grandly as anything else in this
home.  Further up the corridor, there are more doorways leading off to the
east and west.

      <roomdescription>The first doorway to the east leads into a magnificent sitting room
decorated in all gold.  The wallpaper upon the walls are embroidered with
little suns all over the room, the lanterns and candles that are lit
provide enough light to make glow faintly.  The floor in the center of the
room is covered with a huge golden carpet, intricate scrollwork trail down
the sides along with the little tassles.  Two plush couches, both done
also in gold, sit across from each other on either side of the rug.  
Little pillows have been placed neatly in each corner of the couch, each
covered with golden fabric with little suns embroidered in the middle.  
Between the couches sits a long, oval table of dark cherry stained wood.
A silver tea set has been placed upon the glossy surface along with a
large bouquet of flowers that rest in the middle.

east and west into other rooms.  The walls of the hallway are panelled
with a dark stained wood, white sconces mounted upon the walls to provide
light in the otherwise dim area.  The doorway to the west leads into a
large study, somberly furnished.  Even from outside the room, there is the
faint scent of burning tabac wafting along the air.

      <roomdescription>Further down the corridor, a doorway leads west into the private study of
the owner of this house.  It is decorated in mostly somber colors such as
dark green, brown and an earthy reddish hue.  A large window has been
placed within the far wall of the room, providing abundant light for the
room despite the fact there are still a few lanterns scattered about.  A
large desk has been pushed against the wall, facing out towards the window
so whoever sits there has a fantastic view of the Manor house grounds.  
Neatly stacked papers sit upon the desk, next to an inkwell and a vial of
writing sand.  Shelves have been built into two of the four walls of this
room, stacks upon stacks of books lining each.  Two chairs sit near a
fireplace on the eastern side of the room, a small, round table sitting
between the two.  A box made from the same mahogany as the desk rests on
the table's wooden surface, containing tabac and pipes.

second floor of the Manor House.  Doors leading to the east and to the
west are on both sides of the corridor, the floor of the hall covered with
a light blue carpet with intricate scrollwork upon the middle.  Light is
provided by wrought iron sconces that have been mounted upon the walls in
between each door, the flames flickering merrily upon the wicks.  The
walls are no less decorated than the downstairs portion of the house, a
light blue wall paper has been placed upon the walls with twisting vines
embroidered upon the surface with silver thread.

      <roomdescription>This part of the hallway can be busier than the others in the house,
depending on what time of the day it is.  Servants can be seen entering
and leaving a door at the end of the hallway into the room that leads off
from the east here.  The delicious aromas of cooked food fill the air,
leading to the conclusion that the kitchen is probably close to this area.

      <roomdescription>A long, rectangular table sits in the middle of this room, three chairs
line up on either side while one chair sits at each end.  A long, pristine
white tablecloth is draped over the wooden surface of the table, hiding
the glossy finish.  In the middle of the table is a large bouquet of
flowers and to either side are white candles in silver candleholders, that
are lit to provide a trickle of light.  The entire far side of the wall is
made up of floor to ceiling windows, shaped into perfect rectangles just
like the table.  Although they can provide abundant light within the room,
there are heavy drapes that hang to either side that can be drawn in order
to shade the room as well, depending on the mood.  Each of the other three
walls have pictures hanging upon them, a large one sitting over top of the
mantle of the fireplace to the left of the door.

      <roomdescription>This room seems to be the center of alot of activity, servants in their
dark blue livery move back and forth through this area, sometimes carrying
things in and sometimes out.  A myraid of different scents waft up from
bubbling concoctions upon the wood stove over on the far side of the wall.
Pots and pans hang from a rack that rests on a rather large chain,
swinging slightly from where it is mounted on the ceiling.  The chain
leads down and seems to be fastened to a hook that sits on the wall next
to the doorway leading into the pantry.  A large window is built into the
wall at the back of the room, a wooden box sits in the sill with various
herbs growing within the dark earth.  There are counters that cover almost
the entire length of two walls, fresh vegetables and other things sit upon
cutting boards either being chopped up or waiting.

corridor of the upper floor.  Faint shadows play on the dark stained wood
that makes up the doors, leading into each room.  From under the door on
the western side of the hall, comes a thin stream of steam that perhaps
one would expect to come from a bath.  The other door stands slightly
ajar, offering a glimpse of a simple room with shelves of folded linen
within its confines.
