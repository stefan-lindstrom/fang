A small path out of the illustrious city~
A small path leading you from the crowded streets of Falme out to the barren fields of the area beyond. In the distance you can see cattle grazing and small forests dot the area that surrounds you.
You would think the night here would be peaceful and joyous but it is quite the contrary. There is always fighting around. Soldiers and refugees wander the barren fields searching and staring at the destruction that lies beyond which was wrought by them.

A barren field of matted down leaves and grass~
This barren field is littered with dry leaves and matted down grass. Small paths curve through it obviously created by merchants and their wagons slowly tumbling along the uneven path that lies before them.
Trees dot the region and you have a picturesque view of the panoramic countryside which is covered with small farms and the occasional small inn for neighboring farmers.
People reap wheat in the fields and small children run with buckets of water on their heads or under their arms back to the farmhouse.

This small path leads you farther from the city and towards some civilized part of the world.  Hopefully.  The sun is hot and the winds warm, the heat is unbarrable and you do not know how you will continue.

The oak tree~
A large oak tree stands you your north blocking passage and it seems to be the dwelling of more than on species of forest critter. The trees is knarled at the roots extending under your feet and continues to your south several yards.
The branches of the tree look dead as if struck by lightning but there hasn't been a thunder storm in what seems like ages. The bark is cracked down the center and the tree looks on the verge of falling into two pieces on either side.

This is a small path leading through a forest covered with trees and the leaves are brown and dying. No grass is under foot and the blistering weather pounds on you.
The Bitemes circle you like vultures, biting you and making this whole trek annoying. You swing valiantly to get them away from yourself but to no avail as more seem to come every second. You sigh and continue on your tedious journey.

This small basin is filled ever so slightly with water which seems to be evaporating as you look at it. No fish dwell in the warm shallow water and it is clear enough that you can see to the bottom of the basin.
Small rocks line the bottom in intricate and beautiful patterns and you notice a few precious metals grinded into some of these rocks.

You come to the top of the hill and the air is a little more stale and the wind picks up ever so slightly as you ascend this foothill. To the east you see the majestic Mountains of Mist with their fog shrouded peaks.
The grass under you feet is amazingly green and could serve well as a pasture for the many stray farm animals that wander the areas around you.

Inside the Mountains of Mist~
A small curving and seemingly un-ending path lies before you. Nothing seems to move as if time has stopped and you are the only thing left alive. A small breeze blows in and you continue moving.

A narrow Path~
This small path leads off the normal path through the mountains and onto another smaller one. This path looks much like the other path that you have just passed except it is leading in a different direction.
You notice little underbrush around you and not many animals stir. You seem to be alone with the hot muggy air around you, searching and wandering.

Path Turns~
This is a small turn on the path. The turn is rounded and the ground is covered with rocks and underbrush. You can see tracks from rabbits and squirrels but nothing else. The hard packed dirt seems to blend with the brown leaves lying on top of it.
The underbrush crunches under your feet as you walk through it and you feel as if something is following you and you feel and uneasy stare on you. The wind blows slightly and you continue on thinking nothing of the cold stare.

A Clearing in the Mountains~
    In the distance, you can see mountain peaks jutting up one over the other
and the cloudless sky seems to want to rain.  From here, you can see a small
path which descends into a valley you did not notice before.  The valley, 
surprisingly enough, is covered with tall, deep-green trees, although it is
somewhat unclear through the mist.

This path leads off towards the eastern part of the mountains and civilization. The area to the east is the Two Rivers. That is a small farming area which has recently hit by trolloc raids, so people must be careful when making their way through the mount
ains.
