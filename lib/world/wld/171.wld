      <roomdescription>Wide marble columns lead to western entrance into the Dome of Light. The
floor is polished redstone and the ceiling is circular, leading into the
large oval ceiling of the Dome of Truth. To the north and south are 
hallways. Faint stairs can be seen to the north, and sunlight streams in
through the marble columns to the west, where a courtyard can be seen.

Shadows flicker all around the dark walls, and the area up to the north
seems sinister.  The outline of stairs in shadow can be seen as where ever
one walks north.  The hallway continues to the east and south.

A single torch flickers on the wall, casting shadows downwards.  Old
wooden stairs lead downwards to the entrance of the prisons.  Damp stone
walls can be faintly seen and a small spider crawls across the handrail.

to the south, some of them made of brick and some made of dark stone.
There is a small intersection to the east, and a larger, official 
looking intersection to the west. The white walls of the Fortress

seen.

can be seen, and to the west, where it continues straight for a while.
Several other roads branch off this small intersection, which is
paved in a hexagonal pattern with cobblestones. To the north is another
dark alley, and to the south a sign marks the entrance to \c07'Fairview
Road'\c00, the main southern/northern road through the city. The busy
commerce section of the city is south, and a small street lantern is
affixed on the southeast corner of a brick building which looks
to be the same as all the others in this area.

Several small houses made of brown and red bricks are to the northwest and

along this very narrow and dark alleyway.  The alley leads north, where it
appears to have a deadend, and to the south, where a bustling intersection
is reached with the main road through Amador.  Several rats scurry
underfoot, but the area appears to be generally free of garbage and does
not have any offensive smells.  Odd.  Perhaps the proximity of the
Fortress to the north keeps this area as clean as possible.

By the side of the road, a wagon is stopped, and a man dressed in blue

The peddler stands by nervously.  People slow down to look at the peddler

      <roomdescription>This is an official looking area, and a large round table rests in the
center of the room.  Many sconces light the room, giving it a bright, but
sinister look.  The floor is tiled with white marble, and a red shepherd's
crook is tiled in the floor at the entrance to the room.  A wooden window
with a large, low windowseat is to the west, and various documents are
scattered on the table.  The room seems to be some sort of gathering area,
meant for the inquisitors' eyes only.

Dome of Truth.  Marble parapets circle the balcony, and a carved handrail
is along the entire length of the balcony.  The Fortress of Light can be
well seen from this height, as the Dome is several stories above the
Fortress.  The outline of soldiers and children can be seen in the
courtyard below to the west, some fighting and some watching over the
rest.  The city of Amador lies south, and the line of sight from this
height allows one to see the entire city, even to the Royal Palace way off
to the South.
