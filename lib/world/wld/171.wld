      <roomdescription>Wide marble columns lead to western entrance into the Dome of Light. The
floor is polished redstone and the ceiling is circular, leading into the
large oval ceiling of the Dome of Truth. To the north and south are 
hallways. Faint stairs can be seen to the north, and sunlight streams in
through the marble columns to the west, where a courtyard can be seen.

Shadows flicker around you as you pass, and the area up to the north 
seems sinister. The outline of stairs in shadow can be seen as you walk
north. The hallway continues to the east and south.

Old wooden stairs lead downwards to the entrance of the prisons. Damp

white columns and the high walls of the Fortress spread from east to west.
An intersection is to the south, leading to the main road.

ways paved with cobblestones. The road here is laid out with
cobblestones in a semi-circle, ending to the north, where the

storied stone house is to the south, its brown door opening 
onto the street. A wide pathway leads to the main entrance to

Several other roads branch off this small intersection, which is

dark alley, and to the south a sign marks the entrance to \c07&apos;Fairview
Road&apos;\c00, the main southern/northern road through the city. The busy
commerce section of the city is south, and a small street lantern is
affixed on the southeast corner of a brick building which looks
to be the same as all the others in this area.

The allet leads north, where it appears to have a deadend, and 
to the south, where a bustling intersection is reached with the 
main road through Amador. Several rats scurry underfoot, but the
area appears to be generally free of garbage and does not have any
offensive smells. Odd. Perhaps the proximity of the Fortress to 
the north keeps this area as clean as possible.

not too dangerous area. Since this area is very close to the
Fortress of Light, the streets are well patrolled here. But then,
the entire city is well patrolled as the children of light appear
more numerous than the citizens in some parts. A deadend can be 
seen to the north, and a small intersection to the south.

      <roomdescription>The double northern doors open up into a large balcony on the top of the 
Dome of Truth. Marble parapets circle the balcony, and a carved handrail
is along the entire length of the balcony. The Fortress of Light can be 
well seen from this height, as the Dome is several stories above the
Fortress. The outline of soldiers and children can be seen in the courtyard
below to the west, some fighting and some watching over the rest. The city
of Amador lies south, and the line of sight from this height allows one
to see the entire city, even to the Royal Palace way off to the South.

      <roomdescription>This large balcony looks out into the city - or whatever can be
seen from this western vantage point. You mainly see the northern
main road through Amador, the West Gate, and the vast gardens of
this estate. High white stone walls surround the city. Past the
western gate you see flat farmlands.

      <roomdescription>The back room of the house is well, but not pompously furnished.
There are no gilt furniture pieces, nor is there crystal everywhere 
- like you would find in the manses of nobles. There is, however
a strange carpet covering the southern wall, looking to be from
the lands beyond the waste, because it is of a pattern that you
have never seen before. A tall bookcase is against the western wall,
filled with books such as &apos;The Adventures of Jain Faistrider,&apos;
&apos;Voyages Among the Seafolk,&apos; and &apos;The Flame, the Blade and the
Heart,&apos; - most of the books seeming to have a definate traveling
theme.

in dust, almost as if it is rarely used. Oak tables are scattered 
about the room, and small dining cubicles are lines up along the 
southern wall. A maid sweeps toward the back, where a door leads
to the kitchen and a trio of men sit at a dark cubicle. The men
look swarthy and are looking at one another suspiciously. You 
wonder what kind of shady dealings go on here. The Children of
Light are no where to be seen.

A potted flower stands in a corner, looking to be a huge orchid.

to a washroom is off to the side. A small anteroom is north, a
closed door east and a door opens onto the garden and porch to the

trees. Prospect Avenue is to the south.

expensive looking carpets from the lands beyond the Aiel Waste
hanging on them. There is a low bed in the eastern corner of the

see several men playing cards. The room is dark, and the smoke
of a man smoking tabac reaches your nose. The common room stretches
to the south, a narrow hallway leading upwards is at the eastern
side of the room, and an eating room is to the west.

To the south, you see the entrance hallway of the manor, where several
other hallways intersect it. Several wall hangings are on each of the 
walls, looking expensive. The room is lit up by crystal lamps that
contain oil from oilfish imported from Tear.

Two marble columns hold up the ceiling at several span intervals,

You look up to the ceiling, and you see a panorama of landscapes
on the ceiling. The entire countryside has been painted on the
ceiling. Sunshine drifts into a small forest, glinting golden,
and rolling plains are off in the western distance. A star is in
the center of the panorama, and you guess that it represents Amador.

Several other fires are burning, each with a pot or cauldron bubbling
slowly. The kitchens stretch to the south, where two open doors lead
to pantries. Three large counter tops are in the center of the kitchens,
where all the food is prepared. There are copper and iron and steel
pots and pans and utensils hanging on the wall to the east. The
sounds of shouting and orders being given out reach your ears, and
several scullery maids rush around helping the cooks.

men patrolling the lookout tower in front of the Fortress, and
the city is simply crawling with Children of the Light.

      <roomdescription>You stand at the western end of Amador Square, where many
travelers, merchants and citizens stop to rest on the carved
wooden benches nearby, and enjoy the surrounding flowers. 
A small park surrounds this part of the square, providing
shade for everyone. A fountain with a statue of an exotic
fish with platemail scales and a trident rests in the 
center of the square, surrounded by a promenade paved with
white flagstones.

and the entire square is paved in sparkling white flagstones
set in a starburst pattern, leading to the center of the Square 
to the north. Flowerbeds - heartsblush, calma, dara lilies, lover&apos;s
knot, maiden&apos;s hope, and wild roses - are to the east and west,
lining the street leading to the square. A large elder tree is 
in the western part of the southern square, surrounded by a
small wicker fence.

Rolls of fabric line the walls, and every imaginable color and material

appears to be a fitting room. Racks of clothes are arranged neatly at 
the front of the store, and many hats are displayed on the left wall. 
The shopkeeper sits behind a polished oak counter, busy with the day&apos;s

the noises that emanate from this room. The room is crowded,
and you find it hard to get through. Most of the room is
taken up by several well scratched dicing tables, at which
a pair of men dice avidly, cheered or jeered on by the crowd.
Toward the southern end of the room, a game of impromptu
dagger darts is taking place. Several men wielding iron 
and steel daggers are competing against a woman dressed in
breeches and a longcoat. Daggers adorn her everywhere, and
there is even one in her bodice. Her eyes flash as she competes,
and one would almost think she was born to the game.

adorn the walls. Armor made of chain links seems to constitute the 
majority of worn equipment in this shop, and perhaps you wonder if 
that is Petro&apos;s specialty. The shop looks to be well frequented, as 
the floor is dirty and the stairs leading into the shop show many 
scuff marks. The shopkeeper looks about gruffly as you enter, and goes
back to hammering a conical helmet.

of a wealthy house in Amador. The house looks to be a merchant&apos;s,
seeing as the property is not gated or fenced in, and there are 
few if any servants to greet you. The front area of the house
has two mahogany benches that are carved with a Tairen maze 
pattern, and a clock carved with Avendesora leaves stands in a 
far off corner of the room. To the south a staircase leads upward,
and to the west, the back room of the house can be seen.

Merchants shout their wares, farmers arrange their produce in
small carts along the eastern part of the square, and Children

other than Amadacian are represented - apparently not too many
foreigners stay long in this city. Only a few can be seen;
A Taraboner woman sells rugs that are draped over a counter top
and several Ghealdean women walk past.

bright atmosphere for such places, with many lanterns lighting
up the main room to the east and the back room to the south.
There is a large sunburst painted above the door, and the decor
here is all gold and white - apparently this inn is a favorite
among the Children of the Light. The floor is well swept and
mad of polished oak. Several maids scurry about between the
kitchens to the west, and the two main rooms. A stout woman
greets customers and chats near the bar.

      <roomdescription>A wide road is paved with flat gray stones and is fairly dust free,
looking to be well travelled. Tufts of dried, yellow grass grow along
the road, and a few animals can be seen around the brush. A tall, 
white, oval shaped building can be seen toward the north, and white
marble buildings continue to the northwest. Amadacian sentries
and various men dressed in gold and white are toward the west. The 
road continues and narrows markedly to the east, leading to greener
areas - although few are truly green nowadays.

dirt can be seen under the rocks, and yellow grass grows through cracks

you most is the dullness of this strip of road.

A wild dog roams the field, sniffing the ground and running as if 
chasing something every now and then. As you look to the south, you
see a faint blue winding river beyond the dark forest. Rolling hills 
obscure the view of several Amadacian farms that you know to be spread
about in this general area.\c00

of the small path that winds its way east, where a small

west and east are small fields of grass, and the entire
area is a flat plain. To the north are small rocky hills,
and the entrance to a mine shaft.
