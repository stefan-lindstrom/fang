      <roomdescription>This rather empty common room is quiet, excepting an ocassional
clatter from the other common room, or the heavy footsteps of
someone coming down the stairs from their rooms. There
are \c03oak\c00 tables spread throughout, \c07l\c14a\c03n\c10te\c03r\c14n\c07s\c00 lit \c03d\c07im\c03l\c07y\c00 to give
the impression of even more privacy and quiet. Now and then
a shout is raised and echos throughout, &quot;Glory to \c03Illian\c00!&quot;, and just
as frequently, &quot;Glory to Lord Brend!&quot; can be heard. The other room
is west, and the rooms of the inn are up the staircase.

don&apos;t seem to notice as they bake their breads and stew their
foods, even thought salty sweat streams down their brows. Maids
hurry in and out the swinging door in the southern wall with platters
of food and drink. Mostly it seems to be liquids to cool off the
sweaty patrons.. \c01w\c08in\c01e\c00, \c14c\c07hi\c14ll\c07e\c14d\c00 punch, and \c03ale\c00.

the rest of the city and south into a neighborhood. All sorts of
people brush past on their daily activities, mostly on foot, though
occasionally a horse or carriage rolls past.

a &quot;Gate&quot;, seeing as how there are no walls around the city, there are
still guards standing by and trying to keep the peace. Crowds
shuffle in and out of the city boundaries, many being refugees from
neighboring areas. The bustling hordes of people do seem rather
varied, though, with every type of people, arrogant nobles with
spills of \c14l\c07a\c14c\c07e\c00, most in carriages anyway, to the poorest
hungry beggars seeking a bit of coin. The outskirts of \c03Illian\c00 lie
to the north, and the city itself with its canals is to the south.

of thousands of people. Moving in and out of the gates incessantly, most

to those who would hold up the traffic. Most seem arrogant and
confident of their control over the people of Illian.

asks for directions to somewhere in the city. This path seems to follow
the northern wall, running along it for the entire course, which is to say

      <roomdescription>This archway is the entrance to the Square of Tammuz.  The Square is
huge, capable of holding thousands and thousands of men, but now it
only holds a few men and women trying to sell their wares.  The
merchants themselves do not appear all that fit either, as if their
trade is no longer enough to feed them properly.  A few sell swords
wander the area as well, loyalty for sale to the highest bidder.

      <roomdescription>This archway is bordered on one side by the great Square of Tammuz,
and on the other by Council Street.  The Palace of Mattin Stepaneos is
to the west, and the square to the east.  Occasionally, a vagrant 
bumps into you, or begs for a coin.  A troop of Illianer guards come
by, and sneer at you.  Men and women dressed in Lords and Ladies clothing
wander the area.  Perhaps they are more Hunters for the Horn?

a small podium as the center just to your west.  The area is now

something about &quot;a bloody lord&quot;, and walks away.

      <roomdescription>This room is filled with men and women, yelling and screaming.  All
in all, this place looks like a good place to find entertainment.  You
notice a small group of men sitting in the corner, and pretending not
to notice you.  A sign says there are available rooms for 100 coins,
and food and ale available as well.  A Lugarder girl sings songs of
pleasure and wickedness atop a wooden stage.  Still, something smells
wrong about this place.

are several arrow slots, which provide a deadly view of anyone passing
