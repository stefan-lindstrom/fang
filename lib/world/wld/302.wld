      <roomdescription>&amp;KThe walls here seem to have been carved out of - or built around - the
foundations of the buildings above.  From here it's entirely impossible to
tell exactly what structures stand on the surface, but the foundations are
of good hard &amp;ws&amp;Kt&amp;wo&amp;Kn&amp;we&amp;K, it's surface slimed over with &amp;cm&amp;Ko&amp;gu&amp;Kl&amp;cd&amp;K and &amp;yro&amp;gtt&amp;ying&amp;K w&amp;yast&amp;Ke.
There's a rather unpleasant smell in the air, a revolting amalgamation of
refuse, mouldy water, and fungus.  This corner of the sewers is an
intersection of two tunnels - a longer, broader one leading from the south
and a much shorter one leading from the east, meeting at a perfect right
angle.  The stagnant sewage lying in the channel down the centre of the
passageway is particularly filthy here, its course slowed to such an
extent that it hardly appears to be moving at all, sluggishly making its
way along the conduit.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThe tunnel ends here in a pile of rubble and fallen stonework that seems
to have been in place for some time - the tumbled bricks and mortar are
coated with a fair sized layer of &amp;ygrime&amp;K and dirt.  The sewage coursing
down the channel in the centre of the walkway has apparently found some
way through the rubble, for although it seems a little deeper, it isn't
completely flooded.  This tunnel seems particularly short, the sewer
forming a corner directly to the west.  The heat here is fairly mild
compared to that from deeper within the sewers, making it far easier to
breath - there must be some kind of shaft nearby, providing all this
clean, refreshing air.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThis small alcove is little more than a breach in the earth, a crack in
the rock formed by an earthquake or disaster of some kind.  There's hardly
enough room to stand straight, let alone move much, but from above comes
an occasional gust of rank air or rattle of stone..  While it might be too
dark to see anything, there seems to be an empty void above.  By touch, a
person can feel only the &amp;ys&amp;gl&amp;yi&amp;gc&amp;yk &amp;gs&amp;yl&amp;gi&amp;ym&amp;ge&amp;K of sewage - there's certainly no
passage available here.  &amp;n

shafts leading upwards to the streets above, it's hard to get an entirely
accurate idea exactly what forms this place - the tunnel itself is made up
of the foundations of the above buildings, and old, long buried ruins, yet
the walls are in a state of great disrepair and coated with an almost
complete veneer of &amp;ygrease&amp;K and &amp;gs&amp;yl&amp;gi&amp;ym&amp;ge mo&amp;cu&amp;gld&amp;K.  A channel runs down the centre
of the tunnel, roughly a food wide and of an unknown depth - the sticky
substance coursing through it is thick with enough waste to conceal the
exact nature of the bottom, and the floating excretions are enough to
inhibit most curious explorations.  The tunnel from here leads along an
east-west axis, with junctions to each end.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThe tunnel ends here, blocked by a smooth stone wall baring only a little
grime, and hardly any mould.  There's something vaguely incongruous about
the entire setting, something that doesn't quite match up - the rest of
the walls here are &amp;yfilthy&amp;K, and appear far older than the well-built
blockade to the north.  There aren't any nooks or creases that might hint
that this isn't all that it seems, and even the most intent study yields a
depressing lack of results..  Yet something still doesn't quite add up.  
The sewage channel doesn't seem to be blocked, finding some way through
the obstruction, yet the mucky refuse also manages to hide any extra clues
that might be on the ground.  Some other bored explorer, probably in a fit
of irritation, has scratched a lopsided symbol into the wall to the east -
a rather inept rose.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KAn intersection is formed here by two perpendicular tunnels running along
the four major points of the compass - north through south, and east
through west.  The rank odour of &amp;ys&amp;Ke&amp;gw&amp;ya&amp;Kg&amp;ye&amp;K taints the air, &amp;yfilth&amp;K obscures the
fine details of the walls, and the last lingering glint of daylight from a
distant drainage shaft is hugely diminished here, leaving the place cast
almost entirely in darkness.  Indistinct sounds filter down from the paths
above, the murmur of voices or the repetitive clip-clop of a horses
hooves..  Yet beneath it all resides an underlying, low gurgling sound,
that of churning waste.  The foot-wide channels that make their slimy way
down the centre of each tunnel also meet here, but years of negligence
have allowed the junction to become irrevocably blocked by
Light-knows-what - overflowing sewage now floods intersection with several
inches of &amp;gr&amp;ya&amp;Kn&amp;yc&amp;Ki&amp;yd sti&amp;Kn&amp;yking &amp;Km&amp;ye&amp;Ks&amp;ys&amp;K.  &amp;n

- there are fewer shafts leading upwards towards the streets, less light,

refuse here that it moves sluggishly, if at all, and holds a surface

the foundations of the buildings above.  From here it's entirely
impossible to tell exactly what structures stand on the surface, but the

revolting amalgamation of refuse, mouldy water, and fungus.  This corner
of the sewers is an intersection of two tunnels - a longer, broader one
leading from the west and a much smaller, shorter one leading from the
north, meeting at a perfect right angle.  The stagnant sewage lying in the

channel in the centre of the walkway has apparently found some way through
the rubble, for although it seems a little deeper, it isn't completely
flooded.  To the north the tunnel continues, a corner visible at it's far
end.  The heat here is fairly mild compared to that from deeper within the

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThe walls here seem to have been carved out of - or built around - the
foundations of the buildings above.  From here it's entirely impossible to
tell exactly what structures stand on the surface, but the foundations are
of good hard &amp;ws&amp;Kt&amp;wo&amp;Kn&amp;we&amp;K, it's surface slimed over with &amp;cm&amp;Ko&amp;gu&amp;Kl&amp;cd&amp;K and &amp;yro&amp;gtt&amp;ying&amp;K w&amp;yast&amp;Ke.
There's a rather unpleasant smell in the air, a revolting amalgamation of
refuse, mouldy water, and fungus.  This corner of the sewers is an
intersection of two broad tunnels leading from the west and from the
north, meeting at a perfect right angle.  The stagnant sewage lying in the
channel down the centre of the passageway is particularly filthy here, its
course slowed to such an extent that it hardly appears to be moving at
all, sluggishly making its way along the conduit.  &amp;n

upwards to the streets admitting illumination, unsullied air, and the

kitchen intended to serve royalty - it's a broad, pristinely clean chamber
walled in by dull &amp;wgr&amp;Ke&amp;wy&amp;K bricks, the stone floor scrubbed freshly every week
or so, the entire area spider-web free.  On the southern wall near a
stepladder leading back upstairs stands a huge &amp;Kw&amp;wr&amp;Ko&amp;Wu&amp;Kg&amp;wh&amp;Kt &amp;wi&amp;Kr&amp;wo&amp;Kn wine rack, its

of stores are stacked against two of the walls, yet the boxes to the north
in particular look unsettled, their stacking less than perfect, their
contents strangely undisturbed - in fact, they look as if the boxes
themselves have never been opened, although they appear to have been
recently moved.  The oddity is glaring in such an ordered area, and closer
inspection reveals further mysteries - the wall itself, behind the boxes,
has been removed!  The gap is only a dozen bricks wide, and twice as many
tall, but space enough to allow the passage of an average sized adult into
the sewers of Caemlyn.  &amp;n

smaller, gravel-like chips, crumbled mortar and dust obscuring any type of

blocked over by a solid stone wall.  The walls themselves are formed of
mismatched ragged-edged stone, held together by crumbling mortar.  What's

loose &amp;Ks&amp;wh&amp;Ka&amp;wl&amp;Ke&amp;w, &amp;Kg&amp;wr&amp;Ka&amp;wv&amp;Ke&amp;wl&amp;K, and fallen brickwork - certainly not the safest of

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThis region of the huge ballroom-sized chamber is much like its opposite
end, broad, high ceilinged, with a smooth-tiled floor and very nearly
intact stone walls.  A doorway leads north into a dingy, smaller seeming
chamber, and in the eastern direction this chamber continues.  The
darkness isn't broken here by any kind of natural lighting, yet there's an
occasional gust of rank air - somewhere nearby must be an entrance to
another level, or even just a rupture in the rock.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThis seems to be the very centre of a huge chamber - perhaps once a
massive dining room, or a ballroom of sorts.  On the far eastern side of
the chamber, leading south, an arched doorway leads through towards other
parts of the building, if they are still intact, and to the western side a
similar portal leads north.  There are signs that there was once a
fireplace built into the wall on the north, but the fine stonework has
long since crumbled and shattered, leaving only an uneven pile of rubble.
The floor is fairly smooth, even a few ancient paving stones still visible
- although they are badly cracked - yet there's a great deal of gravel
littering the area, and dust.  Most disturbing of all, however, are the
multitude of footprints.  Isn't this place meant to be abandoned?  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThe ancient building continues here, the entryway to the south just
visible and this chamber extending for some distance to the west.  The
stone walls aren't particularly well put together, but apparently hold
some strength - whatever disaster pulled this place underground wasn't
strong enough to entirely destroy the building.  With no natural source of
light at all, the shadows lie heavily here, and from the darkness comes
the occasional sounds of scratching, scuttling, and the whistle of wind
through distant tunnels.  The air here smells a little clearer, although
still carries the rank scent of sewage, indication that there may be a
shaft or stairway nearby.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KIn this section of the network of tunnels beneath Caemlyn natural lighting
is almost nonexistent, provided by very rare breaks in the rocky ceiling
that reach up to the sewers above.  These breaches also seem to be the
nearest source of air, and as such the place stinks, reeking just as badly
as the sewers yet with even more &amp;yfe&amp;gt&amp;yid&amp;K humidity.  The walls are formed of
carved rock, here, with little structure or sense of organization - some
of the nearby tunnels look to be made of the remains of centuries-old
buildings, while others seem to be merely cracks in the rock.  The tumbled
rock here has formed a makeshift stairway leading up to an almost
invisible, narrow gap, and although it doesn't look entirely safe it does
seem to provide passage upwards into the sewers.  &amp;n

tunnels, standing at least thirty foot in height and of an unknown
diameter - it's distant edges are cloaked in shadow, revealing their
secrets only to closer inspection.  The cavern seems to be natural rather
than man-made, as there are no signs of chisel or pick marks, although the
smoothness of the lower sections of the walls indicate that at some point
a &amp;cr&amp;Ki&amp;cv&amp;Ke&amp;cr&amp;K might have taken its route through these deep ways.  The floor is
also smooth but scattered with fallen rock and rubble, so footing isn't
entirely safe.  Several tunnels lead from the chamber, the one to the

noticeably more ragged and strewn with more rubble.  &amp;n

that to the north - not the pitch black of earth and stone, but of
emptiness..  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThe tunnel opens out here into a huge chamber seeming to be a focal point
in this maze of subterranean paths, standing at least fifty feet in height
and of an unknown diameter, descending hundreds of feet into the ground
directly before the tunnel entrance.  The cavern's distant edges are
cloaked in shadow, revealing their secrets only to closer inspection, but
this cave seems to consist of a narrow ledge running all the way around a
huge &amp;cw&amp;Ka&amp;Ct&amp;Ke&amp;cr&amp;K-&amp;cf&amp;Ki&amp;Cl&amp;Kl&amp;ce&amp;Kd hollow.  There's no indication of how deep the
underground lake runs although the lulling trickle of water indicates that
it's fed from a source somewhere nearby.  Stalagmites protrude from the
yawning cave roof, thin twisting curls of rock jutting from the stone like
spindly fingers clawing their way from the rock.  The cavern seems to be
natural rather than man-made, as there are no signs of chisel or pick
marks, and still there is no sign of light or life, just the oddly
resonant echo's of slithering and howling, and of the crunch of gravel
underfoot.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;KThis turning from the main route of the passageway doesn't stretch far
before coming to an abrupt end - the small fissure has almost entirely
collapsed, resulting in a low-ceilinged, rocky, uncomfortable little
grotto.  Even when the wary traveller broaches the darkness with torches
or lanterns, the unstable depths of the cave are hidden by shadows deeper
than even those of the longest night, on the surface.  Here, a draft
produced by some distant mine shaft skips and slithers over the scattered
shale, and tugs at loose clothing, like prying fingertips upon the forms
those brave enough to intrude upon this shadowy domain.  It's
hair-raising, but it's almost as if the darkness itself has &amp;We&amp;wy&amp;We&amp;ws&amp;K..  &amp;n

their shadowy abodes, and in the distance there's the sound of larger
creatures taking flight.  The multifaceted crystals come in a myriad array
of colours ranging throughout the spectrum, bright &amp;Bs&amp;ba&amp;Bp&amp;bp&amp;Bh&amp;bi&amp;Br&amp;be &amp;Bb&amp;bl&amp;Bu&amp;be&amp;K'&amp;Bs&amp;K and

more and more unstable as it continues - narrowing, until finally it's
only a few inches in width and far too risky for further exploration.

cascades &amp;Wc&amp;wr&amp;Wy&amp;w&amp;Ws&amp;wt&amp;Wa&amp;wl&amp;K-&amp;Wc&amp;wl&amp;We&amp;wa&amp;Wr&amp;K water, gushing from the gap to flood downwards over

meets the &amp;Ki&amp;kn&amp;Kk&amp;ky &amp;Kb&amp;kl&amp;Ka&amp;kc&amp;Kk surface of the water it forms ripples across the
waterline, which spread out into wider and wider rings, finally smoothing
out completely to leave the water smooth and serene.  From the yawning
cave roof stalagmites protrude, thin twisting curls of rock jutting from
the ceiling like spindly fingers clawing their way from the stone.  The
cavern seems to be natural rather than man-made, as there are no signs of
chisel or pick marks, and still there is no sign of light or life, just
the oddly resonant echo of the trickling waterfall.  &amp;n

      <roomdescription>&amp;K&amp;KThe narrow ledge skirting the underground lagoon continues here, growing
more and more unstable as it continues - narrowing, until finally it's
only a few inches in width and far too risky for further exploration.  
Below, the depth-less lake seems still and serene, it's surface troubled
by only occasional eddying swirls and disturbed undercurrents.  The water
appears &amp;Ki&amp;kn&amp;Kk&amp;ky &amp;Kb&amp;kl&amp;Ka&amp;kc&amp;Kk, nothing visible at all beneath the waterline, and the
lulling trickle of water indicates that it's fed from a source somewhere
nearby.  Stalagmites protrude from the yawning cave roof, thin twisting
curls of rock jutting from the ceiling like spindly fingers clawing their
way from the stone.  The cavern seems to be natural rather than man-made,
as there are no signs of chisel or pick marks, and still there is no sign
of light or life, just the oddly resonant echo's of slithering and
howling, and of the crunch of gravel underfoot.  &amp;n
