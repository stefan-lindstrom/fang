      <roomdescription>\c00The inn's library is cannot compare to that of a
dedicated library, but it is not small. The many shelves
are lined with books of all types, even a few copies
of \c04The Travels of Jain Farstrider\c00. A stones board
sits upon a table surrounded by two chairs, awaiting
use. Padded chairs are available for the patron's
comfort.

to be leading to the resting and sleeping chambers
of the barracks themselves; some of the guardsmen prefer
those, while the officers and those among the

reside elsewhere.

the faces are not those of old noblemen or long dead
heroes honoured by the city however, but rather members
of the House Trakand, Queen Morgase herself dressed
in a fine gown looking regally down at you, and
the Daughter Heir Elayne Trakand in a smiling pause as
a child, still beautiful despite the honest attempts
of the painter to make her look more like a solemn
awe inspiring form of authority.

      <roomdescription>   Some sort of door here leads west, in a storage
area of sorts. It seems heavy and it must be locked,
while most guardsmen who pass through the area barely
look at it twice. There is a small torch burning
brightly here, sheding light to the corridor and
in a small distance to the north lie the sleeping
chambers of the guard.

to spread out even further, covering an impressive
area that must be larger than three or more regular
city blocks.
   The officers of the place seem to be making sure the
trainees are kept busy scrubbing floors with the kind
of care that allows the white marble to play the role
or mirrors, despite the number of dust and mud stained
boots that walk on it regularly.

propped open, occasionally a few patrons walk in. The
fire in the fireplace crackles and \c03glows\c00 with
a pale, but warm light. A few serving girls dart from
table to table, taking care of the patrons' needs.
A stairway leads to the second floor where the rooms
are located. An opening in the northern wall leads
to the library. Mouth-watering smells seem to emanate
from the kitchen to the east.

      <roomdescription>   The doors next to you seem to lead to the Halls
of Justice, the place where Caemlyn's Magistrates
offer their opinions and occasionally rulings on some
of the everyday life affairs in the city; you will
find few criminals here, but quite a large number of
men and women with civil disputes over land property
and inheritance legal problems along with the
more happy aspects of naming a child and registering
them as new citizens of Andor.
   A single Royal Guard, dressed in fine silvery armour
gleaming in the torchlight stares solemny at you,
and the door behind him seems to be leading to some
sort of waiting room.

room obviously originate from the kitchens. The head
cook watches over the other members of the staff with
a watchful and careful eye. All the foods which leave
the kitchen for a patron's table are touched by her,
as she works magic with her hands and seems to have
an innate knowledge of food.

enough to identify it as \c01blood\c00. There is a large wooden chest runn

with enough for them to handle the everyday law enforcement
in the busy and occasionally troubled city.

he'd better think again, since that just doesn't
seem to be in the plans for these showers.

candleholders at the four corners adds brightness, this room still lends a
feeling of oppression to many standing before the heavy oak desk in the center
of the room.  A well stitched rug lies squarely in the center of the floor, the
emblem of the Lion of Andor on a red background staring up at whoever stands
upon it.  The desk takes up about half of the carpet and a good portion of the
office as well along with the high backed chair sitting behind it.  Two less
comfortable looking chairs wait in front of it for the Magistrate's guests, and
a final wooden one leans up against the wall nearest the door for a guard
should the Magistrate wish him inside the room as opposed to his post outside.
The mantle of the fireplace has been set up to house a small number of books,
most of them titles of law.  The desk itself is cluttered with papers, a pen
and stamp kit, and a small candleholder for late night work.  The only other
decorations are a few portraits of Magistrates that appear dusty -- most likely
never glanced at.

    <roombasic title="The Scribes Hall" vnum="29834" zone="298">
      <roomdescription>This is a rather plain room with long wooden tables that are angled for easy
writing.  Long benches of polished wood run along side the tables.  At
intervals are inkwells and quills as well as pewter candlestands.  Here is
where the scribes work copying book after book of Andor's growing library.  In
front of the tables along the wall are a series of great arched windows with a
diamond pattern that floods the room with light during the day.  The Master
Scribe is often here teaching students and overseeing the work of the scribes.
Sometimes, the Master Scribe is commissioned by the Queen or other nobles at
court to copy books for private collections, but this is expensive and takes a
long time so it is not done often in Andor.  There are no rugs upon the cold
stone floor because of the damage that would be done with ink spills.  The
ceiling is a white plaster with rosettes.

      <roomdescription>The stone floor is covered in a warm colored rug.  There is a marble fireplace
along one wall with a oval, beveled mirror above flanked by half columns with
an overmantle.  The ceiling is a white plaster with bosses and pendants at the
intersection of the ribs.  The arched window has diamond-shaped quarries.  
Below the window is a velvet window seat that matches the chair behind the desk
of the librarian.  From the ceiling hangs a wooden chandelier with tassel
finials.  Upon the desk is a hexagonal lantern from the Lion Hall, a royal gift
to the Librarian.  A wooden screen with pierced tracery serves as a dividing
wall.

      <roomdescription>This part of the library has been sectioned off as an area of study and class,
most often utilized by classes for those entering Law.  The large Royal Banner
takes up a good portion of the wall, though portraits of past queens and
magistrates hang from nearly all of the ruddy panels.  Long tables with well
spaced chairs have been set up on the marble floor for students to sit at and
listen to lectures conducted from the podiums nearer the end of the hall.  
Before the center carpet meets the wall, a space of marble has been left empty.
In its place, intricately colored shards of glass and crystal have been set,
designed to give as accurate a portrayal of the known mapped world as possible.

      <roomdescription>This room contains great leather bound books where upon all the Andoran court
records are housed.  Some are quite old and one of the duties of the Royal
House is to continue to maintain these old documents as they serve as important
historical documents of the country.  Most of the current books are kept on the
library shelves which have locked doors in front of them, much like cabinets.
Only the Royal Advisor of Andor has these keys and the Royal Librarian.  Other
documents older than seventy five years are kept in the open shelves of
bookcases that line the marble floor.  The Librarian of Documents maintains
this special part of the library.  Only those studying the Law have good access
to this library.

      <roomdescription>The earthly smell of wood and reeds turned to paper permeates through this
entire wing of the library, the shelves of books rising up a good twenty feet
or more and extending out about twice as far.  The books here are an assortment
of law of current and past nations, as well as a number of rows containing
tomes on an assortment of other educational topics.  Most of the books appear
new, even untouched, as though there have been few scholars of late roaming the
halls of the library.  In this section, off of the end of the shelves, rests a
small lounge of comfortable chairs and sofas along with a number of tables to
work at.  A marble top table between two large bay windows that look out at an
extensive flower garden serves as an area to find drinks and the occasional
fruit dish or bread basket, complements of the courthouse.

including a section of real and fictional tales passed along by Gleeman and
rumors and finally transcribed to written word.  It is possible to weave in and
out of any number of heavy shelves that reach up at least twenty feet in the
air.  Ladders have been set out for anyone needing to reach the tomes higher
up.  The air has the heavy smell of old paper and bindings and musk from layers
of dust.  Along the walls and placed in every other row of shelves are an
assortment of low benches and leather chairs useable by anyone needing a rest
from searching for the right book.

      <roomdescription>A heavy red rug embroidered with gold trim extends from the wide arched
entrance of the library to the other end of the hall where an equally immense
banner depicting the white Lion of Andor hangs.  This main hallway of the
library has been decorated sparsely but with immaculate care to extend the
pride of Andor.  Everything is clean and straight, brilliant white pillars
lining the sides of the hall just in front of rows upon rows of bookshelves.  
Two white stone lions guard the arched entry, red ruby eyes staring regally out
at the wide opening of the hall that contains numerous dark oak tables and
chairs for any student to relax and read at.  People pass in and out of the
library all hours of the day, their feet padding quietly over the carpet and
occasionally echoing from the glossed marble and up to the high-domed porcelain
ceiling Two main wings can be reached from the hallway, as can the class areas
sectioned off at the far end by the final rows of shelves.

still confined by black metal bars.  There is one bed here, with 
clean \c07sheets\c00, and even a \c07pillow\c00.  There is a small canister here, 
larger then a bucket, but smaller then a \c10barrel\c00, holding some crisp 
clear water.  Were it not for the surrounding metal bars, this room 
could easily be mistaken for that of an \c03inn\c00.

where the \c06Magistrates\c00 are to be found, reached and asked to deliver 
justice of the Law.
   There is a tall desk in the one end of the room, behind which an 
armchair is placed for the \c06Magistrate's\c00 use. This is pointedly the 
only chair in the room, all others, even Lords themselves must be 
standing at all times when the \c10court\c00 is in session, so that the
trials do not last for days at a time. Subtle it might not be, 
but effective it most definately is.
