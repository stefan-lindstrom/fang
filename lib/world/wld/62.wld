Trollocs go about the business of preparing for the last battle.
This part of the camp seems strangly absent of the dreadlords you
can see off in the western portion of the camp, there seems to be
an invisible line they refuse to cross. Looking to the west you
see that the valley is filled with literally hundreds of tents that
must hold thousands of Trollocs. To the north, the relentless hammering
of Thakan'dar seems more like the twisted heartbeat of the Dark One
than a real forge. Icy blasts of \c00\c10sulfurous\c00\c23 air whip about you as the

of various parts of the camp. There is a wide trail through the

      <roomdescription>\c23The arena, unlike the surrounding valley is free from fog and the harsh
voices even though it is open to the air. Overhead thin clouds the colour
of \c08b\c01l\c08o\c01o\c08d\c23 race across the sky and the air here is \c13illuminated\c23 by an unknown
source. The circular floor of the arena has been covered with sand though
there remain several small craters where the sand and even some rock has
been blasted away. The stone walls are tall and completely smooth and in
the northern corner a large rack holds weapons and armour of every make and
description.\c00

      <roomdescription>\c23A walled courtyard presents itself from within the dense fog and
shadow. Seemingly carved out of the very rock of the surrounding 
valley the courtyard faces a large building to the east. The
remaining sides are walled by a jagged black rock and a large
iron gate leads off to the west. The \c04t\c23h\c04u\c23n\c04d\c23e\c04r\c23 and lightning
of the valley itself echos menacingly. The metallic smell of
\c08b\c01l\c08o\c01o\c08d\c23 still lingers in the air.\c00
