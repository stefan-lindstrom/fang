Road to Fal Dara~
The road winds onward to Fal Dara.  Due to the lack of rain, it is quite dusty
and much of the vegetation has turned yellow or brown with death.  A few
trees with deep roots still produce a shimmer of green leaves, but certainly
not their usual rich green color.

\c12The Alisa's Children's Hall\c00~
This room is fairly messy as numerous toys have been scattered about almost
haphazardly.  Several large chest lie against the wall near the only window in
the room.  The other illumination in this room is from the two hooded lanterns
that seem to be unusually bright despite the glazed glass.  In the opposite
corner of the room is a small bookshelf and unlike the toys all of them appear
to be put away.  Next to the bookshelf several large floor cushions are piled
up.  Numerous drawings are tacked up on the walls all of them obviously done by
children of various ages.  The pictures tend to hide the dull blue paint that
was used to cover the wood.  In addition to serving as a play room for the
younger children, older girls use this room for sewing, needlework and weaving.
There are numberous woven baskets containing yarns and threads for various
projects the girls are working on.  In one of the corners is a spinning wheel
and carding items and great spools for spinning wool and even flax.

Office of the Head Mistress~
This room has the only locking door in the entire building.  A large desk
dominates the room and a well worn and faded tapestry covers the wooden floor.
On the desk are various papers and numerous scrolls.  Underneath the desk is a
thick iron box with a very complex locking mechanism.  Several more lanterns
line the walls but apart from that the walls are bare wood.

The Dinning Hall~
A large solid oak table fills most of this room.  Unlike most of the furnishing
elsewhere in the orphanage this table looks new and quite elegant.  Each of the
matching chairs has a small cushion on the seat.  Each place being already set
for the next meal.  The plates while not extremely fancy would make a fine
addition to the average household.  The cutlery is made of silver but of a
simple design.  Three brass candelabras adorn the table each one evenly spaced.
A tapestry covers one wall depicting various animals in a forest landscape.  
Noises can be heard from the nearby kitchen as the next meal is being prepared.
The atmosphere in this room is one of formality and great pains are taken to
heighten the sense of formality.  Along the east wall is a staircase leading
upstairs.

The Wood Shop~
This moderately sized shed is where all the wooden furniture and other items
are repaired or crafted.  The tools lining the shelves appear mismatched as if
they were all collected from various sources before being used in their current
capacity.  There are seven saws of different sizes and style of blade hang from
the rafters on the left side of the shed.  In a hanging bucket off near the
right hand wall are at least fifteen different sized files.  Several axes and
hammers lie in the far right corner.  The workbench is right under a window and
covered in saw dust.  The workbench has various files, chisels and a handsaw
for fine detail work.  On the ground are a couple of buckets containing varying
size nails.  Wood shavings litter the dirt floor.

The Hall's Kitchen~
There is no wasted space in this large room.  A large well tended fire pit
dominates in the center of the room.  Various shelves and cupboards all but
obscure most of the walls.  Oddly enough each cupboard appear to have a latch
and the ones along the floor lock.  There is a small waist high gate the swings
closed across the entrance way into the kitchen though it is open at this time.
The door out back leads to the oven and various herbs and other vegetables hang
down from the ceiling drying mixed in with the various pots pans and large
utensils neccesary for the feeding of large numbers of ever hungry children.  
Not only do the children learn how to cook, but they also learn how to bake,
can fruits and vegetables, make pickles, churn butter, make cheese and make
candles from tallow.

The Garden~
The garden area is well tended and groomed.  The grass is quite lush and green
despite the heat.  A small simple unadorned fountain forms the center piece for
this area.  Around the fountain, are rows of daisies and carnations some of
which have obviously been uprooted then replaced back in a haphazard way.  In
an empty corner of the garden a large maypole is set up for the children to
play with it currently having a ball hanging from it attached with a stout
rope.  Only one tree is present in the garden, a small yet surprising fertile
apple tree.  In the apple tree is a tree house.  The children grow vegetables
in a series of tilled rows as well as herbs.  Besides the apple tree there are
blackberries, snowberries and goldenberries to be found growing along the wall.
There is a rough looking dog house the boys constructed.  Toward the back of
the garden is a playground.  This part of the garden houses a small wooden
fortress, it being a poor copy of a borderland fort and showing obvious signs
of extreme wear and tear.  Near to the fort is a large sandbox with several
buckets and wooden scoops half buried in the sand.  A set of swings are set up
a good distance away and securely anchored into the ground.  Last of all there
is near the kitchen door a number of bee hives which the children learn to
maintain and harvest honey from the honeycombs.

The Yard~
The grass here seems well worn as if many people have spent a fair amount of
time here.  Nearby is a small rack with several thick sticks placed in the
slots.  They all lots very old and many are cracking.  The rack it self however
seems to be very new or protected from the elements as it shows no sign of
weathering.  Toward the back of the yard are very large wash tubs for washing
clothing with rub boards and also for rinsing clothing.  There is cord strung
between trees upon which clothing and bedding and sometimes rugs are hung out
to dry.  Fires under the wash tubs have to be carefully watched and there is a
large paddle for stirring the clothing around in the boiling water.  This is
used for the dirtest of clothing.

The Root Cellar~
Down here the temperature stays quite cool and is perfect for storing food
stuff.  From the rafters above hang clusters of dried herbs.  Wheels of cheese
are wrapped neatly on shelves as well as jars of butter, pickles and canned
vegetables and fruit.  In large trunks are salted meats and some smoked racks
of meat hang from the rafters.  It is rather dark down here and candles or
lanterns are most handy.  Beyond this room toward the back lies a large storage
room.  This back room gives definition to ordered chaos for though at first
glance it appears to be neatly organized upon closer inspection you can see
that things where thrown or stuffed where ever there was room.  Worn out and
broken items of all descriptions have been placed here along with all the extra
furnishings and bedding forming a jumbled heap.  Unlike the rest of the
orphanage the dust here gives evidence that this place does not get cleaned
very often.  Back in the main part of the root cellar there are large clay jars
upon the floor.  Each jar is labeled in a neat flowing script.  Various sacks
of grain and meal lie on the floor neatly tied and also neatly labeled with
tags.

The Staff Hall~
This room houses five beds each neatly made in a manner similar to the
childrens.  At the foot of each bunk is a lockable chest though none of them
are currently locked.  Around the room at various intervals are more childrens
drawings, taking the place of the tapestries one might normally find in a bed
room.  The floor is very clean and looks to be subjected to washing on a
frequent basis.  This room does not look any more luxurious than any other in
the orphanage.  The same type of braided rugs from scraps are found upon the
floor as well as washbasins and a copper tub.  There are wood screens of six
folding panels that are often used for privacy.  There is one small desk that
the staff shares and it is kept very orderly.

The Girls Hall~
This room could easily be mistaken for a barracks as two rows of bunk beds line
each wall.  Visible through each window is the external iron bars over them.  
Each bed is made nicely and a chest is a the foot of each bunk bed and another
is placed against the wall to the right of each one as well.  Several large
hampers stand at the far end of the room for laundry.  The wooden frames look
old but also show no signs of neglect.  The room has been painted a bright
white in an attempt to make it seem bright and cheery.  Large braided rugs made
from scrapes cover most of the floor.  There are two small wash stands with
ceramic pitcher, basin and clean towels on each side of the room for washing
hands and face.  Also there is a large copper tub for bathing.  Upon the walls
hang some of the weaving and needlework of the more talented girls.

The Class Room~
This large room is big enough to house all the orphans at once.  Six rows of
desks each with a little wooden chair take up most of the space in the room.  
Each desk has a space inside with which to store quill, ink and parchment.  
The teachers desk lies at the front a feet few in front of the large slateboard
that almost covers the whole wall.  Several windows are on the wall to the
south to ensure a lot of light gets into the room.  Several lanterns hang from
brackets keeping the room always bright.  In a small bookcase near the back of
the class room are all the books that the class might need or use in the course
of the teachings.  The floor is quite clean looking like it is scrubbed daily
as do the walls.  A small name tag on each desk designates who owns each desk.

The Boys Hall~
This room has two rows of bunk beds heading down each side of the room.  
Visible through each window is an external iron grate to keep unwanted visitors
out.  Each bed is neatly made, with one large chest at the foot of the bunk and
another on its right against the wall.  Two large wicker baskets are at the
opposite end of the room.  One of the lids is open revealing the dirty laundry
in it.  The room has been freshly painted a soft warm blue and a slight trace
of tonight's supper lingers in the air.  A pair of blue stained wash tables
stand at opposite side of the room without a clean towel to be seen.  A copper
tub with a few dents in it lies at the far end of the room for bathing.

The Treehouse ~
From the treehouse is a good view of the rest of the yard.  A pile of old
blankets lies in the corner half burying tattered teddy bear.  A few toys are
scattered about the floor attesting to its popularity as a playing as well as
resting spot for the orphans.  Two holes are in the floor one for a rope to
shimmey down the other for the ladder up.  The wood walls are of mismatched
planks though they fit together well.  The roof is leaky but still mostly
sound.

Master Figrin's Loft~
This is an old loft built above the wood shop.  It has plank boards that form
one side that over looks the wood shop below.  The plank flooring creaks when
walked across and there is a large braided rug upon the floor.  A narrow bed is
pushed up against the wall and dressed with soft cotten sheets and bed
coverings.  A wash stand with a chipped mirror also stands against the wall.  
At the foot of the bed is a wooden trunk that holds clothing.  There is a
couple of straight back chairs and a rocker with intricate carvings.  The one
window is round and lets in a yellow glow of light during the day.
