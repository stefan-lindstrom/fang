The balance of \c02N\c09a\c03t\c02u\c09r\c02e\c03s\c06 seems quite in effect down here as larger
predators circle hunting for food.

      <roomdescription>\c00Leaving the dense forest behind the trees begin to thin quite noticably.
Shrubs, small brush and patches of grass fill the gaps between the trees,
while a piering cry of a bird of prey can be heard above, bringing attention
to the vast \c14snow\c00 capped peaks of the \c07Mountains of Mist\c00.  A few boulders lay
abouton the ground, an ominous warning of the mountains above.  Nearby
the chirps and whistles of small birds can be heard through the trees.
The ground is no longer the soft moss and leaves of the forest but a harder
firmer soil.  An almost invisible path leads off into the brush.

the forest and to a small dwelling.  The area seems very 
peaceful with a few small structures hanging from nearby trees
attracting quite a few birds as well as other smaller animals.
A small yet steady streams flows down the hill and off to the
right.  The hut is a simply affair with a small window facing
out and a plain wooden door.  The roof has been set to overhang
quite a bit creating a shelter from the rain.  A small pile of 
wood has been stacked beside the door and a large log seems to
be set up just outside the door to sit on. The path has ended
here and does not appear to continue as dense forest surrounds 
the small hut.

and mushrooms are hanging from lines strung across the room. 
To the west is a doorway through which  looks to be a small

pushed up against the wall and a brick hearth on the other side.
An odd yet comfortable chair has been set up to look out the
front door.  Beside the chair a long pipe rests on a small round 
table.  There is only one small window on the front wall that 
can be seen.  The other walls are covered in shelves and cabinets. 
Upon the shelves you can see many empty vials and many more filled 
ones.  The entire room seems extremely organized and well kept.

odd form.  A doorway to the east leads back to the main room, 
while a large window on the west wall offers a serene forest view.
A floor of planked wood looks freshly swept yet obviously worn from
use.  A few hooks mark the walls to hang clothing on but the room is
otherwise bare.  The only exception is one small painting of a child
that hangs above the bed.

      <roomdescription>Again the tunnel splits off into two directions.  However this time there
appears to be some difference between the two passages.  The western passage
appears to be a much rougher and jagged cut, it&apos;s walls and ceiling covered in
pointed shards and out-croppings of rock.  The Southern passage on the other
hand appears much easier travelling with minimal interference along the walls.

      <roomdescription>The tunnel takes an unexpected dip at the end of the room, travelling
downward into the mountain&apos;s heart.  Snarling and scratching noises can be
heard echoing up from the hole.  The downward passage looks rather
treacherous while the level pathway appears much more appealing.  The 
tunnel floor seems strangely clear as if something was tragged through.

      <roomdescription>A smooth trough of rock similar to a slide travels deaper and
downward into the mountain.  Luckily there seems to be enough
jagged rock along the sides to climb back up but it would be
very easy to just slide down the centre.  The walls also seem
to be rouch hewn helping if ever an upward climb was needed.

the floor are bones of animals and what appear to be humans.  The rank
odour that assaults the senses is almost enough to cause injury itself.
This prison, of sorts, seems to have been well used and had quite a few
occupants if the number and depth of the scratches on the wall are any
indication.
