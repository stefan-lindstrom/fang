chapter13~
The Spider was originally known as Lillen Moiral.  
Lillen was an advisor for investments, and was 
cautioned a number of times for violating the 
laws and ethics of the business.

Moghedien turned to the Shadow long before the War 
of Power actually began.  However, she joined Lews
Therins staff and gained a position of high standing.  
Several disasters early in the war were the result of 
her work.

Some people, among these were some of the Forsaken, 
looked down upon her for lurking in the shadows.  
Moghedien resented this.  She ran a very efficient 
intelligence and sabotage network, which was a great 
aid to the cause of the Shadow.

Her greatest talent was her expertise in Telaranrhiod.  
In the World of Dreams, she was unequaled, even by Lanfear.  
While she most certainly could never have equaled Lanfear 
in the waking world, in Telaranrhiod Moghedien could 
have bettered the Daughter of the Night.
~
E
chapter12~
Initially known as Nemene Damendar Boann, the 
woman to be called Semirhage was as well known 
for healing the body as Graendal was at healing 
the mind.  She was frequently summoned to places 
all across the world to Heal people who were out 
of the reach of most every other Aes Sedai in 
the world.

In addition to being a Restorer, though, Nemene was 
also a sadist.  In return for Healing her patients, 
she also gave them all a great deal of pain.  
Few complained, as pain was a small price to pay 
for still being alive.

When the Hall of the Servants discovered what she 
was doing, they gave her two choices.  One was to 
be bound with the Power against doing violence, 
the other to be severed from the True Source.  
Given those two options, she chose a third: 
swearing to the Dark One at Shayol Ghul.

Semirhage spent some time serving as both a general 
and a governor for the Shadow .  Her reigns over 
conquered territory were particularly of a particularly 
violent nature, even for one of the Forsaken.  It was 
Semirhage that discovered that a circle of thirteen, 
with thirteen Myrddraal, could turn an Aes Sedai to 
the Shadow against his or her will. 
~
E
chapter11~
Graendal was certainly the most decadent and flashy of 
the Forsaken.  However, prior to turning to the Shadow, 
Kamarike Mardim Nindar lived a simple life.  She helped 
heal mentally ill patients who could not be helped by 
Healing or the One Power.

Kamarike was admired by many for her excellent works.  
Not many people who knew her even liked her, though.  
She did not approve of anyone who lived a life which 
was not as simple as she thought was right. This meant 
that she did not approve of anyone.

Within ten year of the drilling of the Bore, she changed 
completely.  Her change had nothing to do with the Bore 
being drilled.  She apparently decided that the world 
could not live up to her standards, so she adopted a life 
style which was the exact opposite of everything she had 
previously stood for.

One of the first to recognize what it was the world 
actually faced, Graendal was the second of the Forsaken 
to swear to the Dark One.  She used her knowledge of the 
mind to help the Shadows cause, and was extremely skilled 
at intrigue.  While never a general of any army, she 
headed a number of very effective subversion efforts.
~
E
chapter10~
Unlike many of the people who would eventually become known 
as the Forsaken, Saine Tarasind was not among the best in 
her profession.  Saine harbored dreams of becoming a researcher 
since she had been very young.  But she was turned down for a 
research position at Collam Daan. She ended up teaching there 
instead.  Rather than making discoveries, she found herself 
teaching about the discoveries of others.

Unfulfilled, Saine turned to the Shadow.  Mesaana proved herself 
an adequate general, but was brilliant as a governor of conquered 
territory.  Her administrations were efficient, and she started 
schools which taught children to spy and report on each other. 
These same children were encouraged to destroy museums and other 
sources of ancient knowledge.  It was important to root up and 
obliterate the old order, in preparation of the Dark Ones 
triumph.
~
E
chapter9~
Lanfear was originally named Mierin Eronaile.  She 
alone of the Forsaken chose her own name, which means 
'Daughter of the Night' in the Old Tongue.  Mierin was 
extremely beautiful, certainly one of the most beautiful 
women of any Age.  She was also the most powerful of the 
female Forsaken, possibly more powerful than any save 
Ishamael.

Mierin worked at Collam Daan, the prime center for research 
into the One Power.  The Aes Sedai of the time, despite 
doing things which are currently undreamed of, were chafing 
at the restrictions place upon them by the divisions between 
saidin and saidar.  Mierin and others were looking at what 
appeared to be a source of power which could be channeled 
without the male and female divisions of the One Power.  
What they actually had discovered was a place in the Pattern 
where the Dark Ones prison was thinner.  Mierin was one of 
the leaders of the team which drilled the hole into the Dark 
Ones prison.  From known evidence, she did not realize until 
afterward what is was that they were doing.

It is clear that Mierin had a relationship with Lews Therin .  
However, Lews Therin broke off the relationship. It was clear 
that she wanted him only for his power and prominence, and as 
a path to power for herself.  She never accepted the severing 
of their relationship and Lews Therins subsequent marriage 
to Ilyena.

Lanfear never led any armies for the Shadow, yet she was still 
an extremely valuable asset in the fight against those forces 
which opposed the Dark One.  She used Telaranrhiod for the 
Shadow, driving people mad or insane, as well as performing 
actual assasinations.
~
E
chapter8~
Belal, the Envious, is certainly the Forsaken of 
whom the least is known.  A master of manipulation, 
his reputation led him to be known as the Netweaver.

Originally he was Duram Laddel Cham.  Little is known 
of Belals life before he turned to the Shadow.  
Some records indicate that he may have been a strong 
force opposing the Shadow before during to the Dark One.

Belal was a better manipulator than Rahvin and more 
skillful  than Sammael in dealing with enemies in open 
conflict.  For this reason Belal was an extremely 
dangerous adversary.  Belal is suspected to be among 
those who razed the Hall of the Servants days before 
the Bore was sealed.
~
E
chapter7~
Little of Rahvins life before during to the Shadow 
is known.  He was named Ared Mosinel.  Rahvins major 
weakness was his fondness for women.  He was also 
susceptible to flattery.  People frequently rose 
quickly in his administration by flattering him.  
However, he was quick to remove people who were 
too unsuited for their duties.

Rahvin preferred diplomacy and manipulation to any 
kind of open conflict.  One of the things which is 
known for certain about Rahvin is that he had a 
tendency to use Compulsion.
~
E
chapter6~
Tel Janin Aellinsar was a world renowned sportsman, 
and was a good friend of Lews Therin Telamon.  He 
was one of Lews Therins best generals, and quickly 
fell in love with war.  Most likely it was the honors 
and special privileges which came with being a high 
ranking officer which he enjoyed the most.  Tel Janin 
was always at his best when he was on the defensive, 
and the forces opposing the Shadow were often on the 
defensive.

He considered himself a much better general than the 
Dragon, and resented the fact that Lews Therin had 
received the overall command of the forces opposing 
the Shadow over himself.  Suddenly, during the middle 
of the war, he turned to the Dark One.  Sammael believed 
that the forces of the Shadow would inevitably win. He 
also had a very deep hatred of Lews Therin.

Sammael wore a deep scar which was given him by Lews 
Therin.  While such a scar could have easily been Healed 
during the Age of Legends, he chose not to.  Sammael was 
determined to wear it until he had defeated the Dragon.  
As a governor of conquered territories, his administrations 
were terrible.  He paid no attention to the general 
population, and hunger and disease were commonplace.  
His armies, on the other hand, were well fed and taken 
care of.  He did not want his armies to let him down when 
it was important they perform well.
~
E
chapter5~
Before turning to the Shadow, Joar Addam Nessosin 
was an accomplished musician.  A child prodigy, 
who was accomplished at both composition and 
performance, he never fully fulfilled his childhood 
promise.

It was for this reason that Asmodean turned to the 
Shadow.  With the promise of immortality, he could 
eventually reach musical heights he was destined for.  

Asmodean was never a general for any army, though he 
did serve as a governor of conquered territories.  
Perhaps one of his greatest atrocities was the revenge 
he took against the worlds most famous musicians and 
artists.  Asmodean had these artists maimed so they 
would never again be able to perform their art. He 
then released them.
~
E
chapter4~
Before turning to the Shadow, Eval Ramman was a 
historian, unable to distinguish himself enough 
to earn the coveted third name.  He specialized 
in the study of vanished cultures, but his work 
was not outstanding.  Eval Ramman had a bad temper
which almost caused him to be bound with the One 
Power to prevent him from doing something violent.

He enjoyed consorting with the lower elements of 
society, and was very popular with the women.  
Perhaps the only reason he did not lose his job 
was his great strength with the One Power. The man 
to be known as Balthamel went to the Shadow for 
the simple promise of immortality.

Balthamel might have run an intelligence network 
which competed with that run by Moghedien . One 
of his most prominent atrocities was setting up 
camps to breed humans as food for the Trolloc 
armies which were ravaging the land.
~
E
chapter3~
The man called Aginor was the second most powerful of the 
male Forsaken.  He was originally named Ishar Morrad Chuain, 
and was one of the foremost biological scientists of the 
Age of Legends.  He did not like the widely held belief 
that everything worth discovering had already been discovered.

He was one of the first Forsaken to turn to the Great Lord 
of the Dark.  Aginor apparently turned to the Shadow so he 
could perform the experiments he wanted to.  Before turning 
to the Dark One, he was reprimanded several times for 
performing unauthorized experiments.  He used his skills 
as a biological scientist to help the Shadow tremendously.  
It was Aginor who created the Shadowspawn, the first of which 
were the Trollocs.  Some of his creations are still very 
well known, such as the Draghkar .  Others have apparently 
disappeared with time, such as the Gholam and jumara.
~
E
chapter2~
Before turning to the Shadow, Ishamaels name was Elan 
Morin Tedronai. Ishamael means 'Betrayer of Hope' in 
the Old Tongue. Ishamael was also known as Baalzamon, 
Heart of the Dark, and Soul of the Shadow.

Elan Morin Tedronai was a prominent philosopher of the 
time. He believed that the war between the soul of Lews 
Therin and the Shadow had gone on since creation. He 
viewed this as an endless battle between the Creator 
and the Dark One, using human surrogates.

After turning to the Shadow, Ishamael fought hard to 
convert Lews Therin to the Shadow. It was Ishamaels 
belief that in some previous turnings of the Wheel, 
Lews Therins soul had become a champion of the Dark One.

Ishamael was among the first, if not the first, to 
pledge his soul to the Dark One. He was the strongest 
of the Forsaken. Only Lews Therin himself was could hold 
as much of the Power. 
~
E
chapter1~
Demandred was originally known as Barid Bel Medar.
Barid Bel Medar could have been the most influential 
and acclaimed man of his Age, if it were not for Lews 
Therin.  He was born one day after Lews Therin. He 
was almost as powerful as the Dragon, almost as 
skilled.  

During the War of the Shadow, Demandred finally 
discovered something at which he was at least the equal 
of Lews Therin - as a military commander.  When Lews 
Therin was named commander of the forces opposing the 
Shadow, Demandred was furious.  He believed himself the 
intellectual superior to the Dragon.  He made the cold 
calculation that with Lews Therin commanding the forces 
opposing the Shadow, the Shadow would win.  Demandred 
then decided to side with the Dark One.

Demandred did not get along with the other Forsaken very 
well, particularly Sammael .  Demandreds hatred of the 
Dragon put him in conflict with Sammael. Both wanted to 
be the one to personally defeat Lews Therin.
