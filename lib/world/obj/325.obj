sword callandor replica~
This is an exact replica of the sword Callandor, the sword that
isn't a sword. This is a sword made out of a material looking like 
glass, but it seems unbreakable. This original Callandor is a
huge Sa'angreal, one of the largest ever made, and is now kept
safe in the Stone of Tear, where it awaits the Dragon Reborn. 
It's guarded by strong traps, and it's one of the surest sign
that the Dragin is reborn, when someone can take it out of it's
safeguard.

an oddly glowing \c02emerald\c00~
A fine stone lies here..\c02glowing lightly\c00, easily mistakeable for an emerald with its green shade.~
The stone appears to have something finely carved onto it's smooth, edgless surface.
The writing is unintelligable..the letters foreign, consisting of harsh strokes and angular markings.
