The Warder's Creed is carved deeply into the granite rim of the fountain.
It's words sum up the entirety of Warderhood in a few short lines:

Mia sora inde far Mai, mia moridin inde far Mai...
Aeth misain ye, manshima misain ye, valdar misain ye...
Cue cuebiyari, souvraya ti sovya, sora ti sora...
Inde'ayende e inde caballien, hei jenn,

fountain~
A large circular granite fountain stands here, a massive statue rising
from it's center.  Around it's rim, the Warder's Creed is incised deeply
into the stone...  Nearly as deeply as it is incised into the Warders
themselves, to whom the granite of which this fount is carved bears
a strong resemblance.
