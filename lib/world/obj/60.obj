coarse wool. Each bears a similarity however, holes and patches of

metal twisted~
The piece of metal appears twisted and bent, its edges already beginning to rust.
By its shape you guess that the twisted remnant was once conical in shape with an
opening in front. The tattered remnants of a leather strap on the edge of one of
deformed pieces gives the impression that the metal was, infact, once a helmet. The
large gash in one side, the blow that apparently destoryed the object, indaictes it 
was little use to its wearer.

Set deeply into the black stone wall a human sized cage stands
waiting. It's iron bars are broken in the regularity only by a
single small door on the front side. Now standing ajar the door
seems to able to be secured with a large well used chain and 
lock. A combination of old straw and dirt line the cage's base,
small black patches of what could be dried blood along the edges.

&KThe bed appears to be made from exquisitly carved black wood. 
The rounding of each of the four bed posts and their decoration
with intricate swirls and mazes seems to be the work of inhuman
hands. Black silk dominates the quilts and pillows, and the only
real colour is the vivid of the symbol set into the bedhead, three
&Rb&rl&Ro&ro&Rd &rr&Re&rd&K concentric rings surrounding a shadowy sunburst.&n
