Promotion~
After completing the WHOLE syllabus for the rank, the guild member may take the Asha'man Promotion Test. This may be performed by those of Asha'man rank only, and consist of testing the player ICly in all weaves, and blade forms he has currently learned, including knowledge of various things. Players may readily fail the test, so do not assume passing is the only outcome.

This lesson should cover every secondary detail about wielding and using the One Power.

Tying a Weave - Applicable to such weaves as shields, the channeler can tie the whole weave into knots, effectively cutting off the need for the channeler to maintain the flows for that weave. The weave will stay tied only for a time-depending on the strength of the weave and knot.

Splitting Flows - With training, Asha'man will learn to split their flows, through force of will. This allows for numerous weaves and complex weaves to be possible. 

Male vs. Female - Males are generally stronger in the One Power, adept at Fire and Earth. Women   generally tend to have more dexterity in weaving threads, adept at Air and Water.

Thread Affinity - Men and women of this age generally express innate ability in the usage of one or two threads of the One Power.
~
E
Beginner~
\c03Begin with an introduction to the five threads of the One Power. The thread's flows can be seen extending from the channeler's body, while the observer grasps, by color and feel. One flow from the five types can be channeled as of now, until they learn to split their flows at a later lesson. Have the students gain a feel for each weave, and have them channel each until they are comfortable.

Fire  - The orange-red of a flame, in color. Used for burning, explosions, and in complex weaves.

Earth - The healthy brown of the soil, in color. Used for construction, destruction, and in complex weaves.

Air  - The light blue of the sky overhead, in color. Used for weather control, air manipulation, and in complex weaves.

Water - The dark blue of the oceans, in color. Used for weather control, water manipulation, and in  complex weaves.        

Spirit - The color of the purest white, that seems to pulse of its own life. Used as a building block for many complex weaves, and also to shield from the One Power.

After lesson, a high-collared black coat and a black-handled blade are given. Assignment of chores is up to you, but must involve all use of the One Power. Student is hereby considered an Asha'man Soldier.

Weave~
\c03[Heal] - Air, Water, and Spirit used to form a "complex weave" over the wound, to heal it. Both the strength of the healer and the one being healed are needed for this to work. People healed by men feel violated by a cold touch, and both are usually fatigued afterwards. The Asha'man's is a rather crude form.

[Shield] - A weave of pure Spirit, placed over a person to shield them from grasping the One Power, or cutting their connection to it. Much harder to shield a person already grasping, and depends on strength.

[Fireball] - A flow of Fire molded into a ball and covered in a shell of Air, which in then sparks the creation of an everyday fireball.

[Airwall] - A flow of Air expanded and meshed out into a wall in front of you, held together by a frame made of Spirit. Can slow projectiles and weapons, and rare cases stop them altogether.

[Airblow] - A strong flow of Air, enough Saidin to solidify it, and physically direct it at someone to bash, invisible to the eye.'

[Gate] - Weave flows of Spirit on one point in the air to physically punch a whole in the pattern to your destination. You must know the location you are gating from well, as in spending at least a twenty minutes there, observing your surroundings. You can gate to any place, even those you have not been to before, because you can recognize thread locations, which make up the pattern, even though you don't know the real place.

[Test] - The test weave itself is a small amount of Fire used to create a flame. The person looks into a candle or flame for ten to fifteen minutes while concentrating. If that person has the ability to learn how to channel, or has the spark, the tester will feel a resonance signifying that that person can become a channeler.

[Wrap] - Circlets of Air tightened around either the wrists, or ankles, or both. Through force of will, you can constrict the ability to move arm, leg, or both.   

[Sliceweave] - Intertwined Fire and Spirit threads aimed at another weave in an attempt to slice it apart, rendering it useless.

[Explode] - Intertwined Fire and Earth threads aimed at any object cause it to explode violently-including live targets.

Formlist~
\c03[Unfolding the Fan]: (defense) This is a circular parry. For a right-handed practitioner, the sword starts at about the 10 or 11 o'clock position and moves clockwise (a left handed practitioner starts at 1 or 2 o'clock). This parry, if properly timed, will knock away downward and diagonal attacks. It is best used in combination with other forms and maneuvers. Counters: Stones Falling Down the Mountain (either or both strikes).

[Kingfisher Takes a Silverback]: (low attack) A short, quick slash to the outside of the opponent's knee. The wrists instead of the arm should cause almost all of the sword's motion. This is a good maneuver to do as a counterattack, as the opponent's own motion makes the strike more harmful.

[Bundling Straw]: (defense - counterattack) Sword held parallel to body, point up, and moves horizontally across the body, used to parry. Immediately after parrying, the sword slashes downward at the attacker's stomach and legs, moving in the opposite direction as before.

[The Falcon Stoops]: (counterattack) Though not a defense form, this is commonly used after a parry as a counterattack. Start with a quick fake to the side of the head (this should prevent the opponent from moving closer or attacking) and immediately follow with a step forward and a diagonal slash down the opponent's torso.

[Parting the Silk]: (attack) Fast, strong horizontal cut (neck) followed by a downward diagonal slash (shoulder to opposite hip). First strike can be countered by a backward leap, but may leave open to second strike. Notes: This form can be countered by: Cat on Hot Sand.

[Cat on Hot Sand]: (defense) Leap around, parrying, one parry per hop. Move is left, right, and/or back, but never forward. (This can get you impaled) Notes: Keep moving. This form is the counter to Parting the Silk.

[Lizard in the Thornbush]: (opportunity attack) A lunging thrust to the opponent's throat, followed by a quick step back and a diagonal slash across the torso. Note: Commonly used against multiple opponents to take one of them out quickly.

[Stones Falling From the Cliff]: (surprise attack) - leap forward, making a single downward slash at your opponent's head, neck, or shoulders, employing your weight to power the blow.  Distance is of primary importance here, as you will be impaled on his blade if you are too close when you make the leap.

By learning to channel, you can prevent death and the deaths of others through misuse of the One Power. With this gift, we ask two things: Loyalty to the Black Tower, and to serve as an army of channelers for Tarmon Gaidin, the Last Battle. Recruits should be taught to keep quiet about the Black Tower and its location, a
d to never betray it. Use of the institution of the "M'Hael" is acceptable as a tool of fear as far as consequences are concerned.

M'Hael~
\c03This is designed to mold recruits into M'Hael fanatics at their early stage of development. =)  

The M'Hael is the law of the Black Tower. He should inspire fear and respect. The history of the M'Hael, as false dragon Mazrim Taim, whom raised havoc in Saldaea. Rumored to be almost as powerful as the Dragon Reborn himself, and has the duty of training all of the Black Tower for the Last Battle.

Wilder~
\c03Explain the differences between the two, and how being taught is justified due to safety (Untrained channelers are a danger). Also determine which of the two the learner is, and make sure he knows that.

Wilder - There are a very few who are born with the ability to touch the True Source whether they wish it or not, though even they require teaching to fully use their gift. These are called wilders. While normally stronger in potential strength than others, their ability without training is minimal, for some grasping a few times uncontrollably. For others, weaving a flow of the One Power. And for others, it could blend in to what you do, for example, Nynaeve unconsciously using the One Power to aid her wh
le she tends people as a Wisdom. Channeling without training is extremely dangerous to your health, and causes many side effects. A great many wilders have a block, which is a handicap in their ability to grasp, due to denying they can channel, or just plain bad luck. The block comes in may forms, such as only being able to grasp and channel when angry, or only when your eyes are closed. 

Latent Channelers - These make up the majority of the channeling populace, which in turn make up 3 to 4 percent of the general population. These men have the innate ability to be taught how to grasp, and then how to channel, but without assistance, will never come to know the powers bestowed upon them. 
~
E
Asha'man~
\c03The Asha'man were gathered together from places all over the world. Male channelers formed into a military unit, to be used as weapons in the Last Battle, under Rand al'Thor.

Asha'man, the name taken by followers of the Dragon Reborn, men who have come to what is now being called the Black Tower in order to learn how to channel. Some have dreamed of channeling despite all the dire risks, while others remain only because passing the test for the ability to learn has itself started them on the road to channeling, and they now must learn to control it before it kills them. They train not only in using the One Power, but also in the use of the sword and in fighting with hands and 
eet. Unlike Aes Sedai, who go to great lengths to make sure that those they train are not allowed to move dangerously fast, the Asha'man are pushed hard from the beginning, most especially in learning to use the Power as a weapon. It is expected that a certain number of Asha'man Soldiers will die or be burned out attempting to learn. 

Recruit is hereby known as a Student of the Black Tower, and is given physical chores to attend to.
~
E
Neutral~
Aes Sedai - Be it the ones loyal to Elaida, or the rebels hiding somewhere, the majority scorn us, and the Red Ajah, which purpose is to find and gentle all males. While you might think this certifies an act of aggression, no Aes Sedai is to be harmed by an Asha'man.

Whitecloaks - Believe using the One Power is usurping the Creator's will. Overzealous and arrogant. To be left alone.
~
E
Allied~
\c03Rand's Aiel - They serve Rand, and some even help on the Black Tower.

Legion of the Dragon - They serve Rand, help us recruit, and take all the ones that fail the test. (No Guild)

Band of the Red Hand - They serve Mat, who in turn serves Rand.

Two Rivers - They serve Perrin, who in turn serves Rand.
~
E
Hostile~
\c03Shaido Aiel - They serve a usurper of Car'a'carn, whom is Rand, therefore they are considered enemies. Their exact whereabouts are unknown.

Darkfriends - Any who worship and further the cause of the Dark is an enemy of a weapon of the Light. They reside in all societies of Randland. Some may have even corrupted our very ranks. The must be discovered and eliminated if we are to win.

Seanchan - They seek to invade our lands, enslave our peoples, considered hostiles. Come from a land across the Aryth Ocean.

Dragonsworn - Rabid band of poor farmers that follow a false prophet whom promotes foul deeds such as razzings and stealing. Considered hostile and should be loathed.
~
E
Saidin~
\c03Saidin is like pure water. Tainted Saidin is oil mixed with that water. Taint is an oil slick. Men tend to lose control due to the taint, either dying in one bout of madness, usually causing many deaths around him, or slowly wasting away from the inside, his body rotting. It is rumored the M'Hael uses wine to passively remove these victims. 
~
E
Void~
\c03To learn how to grasp Saidin, first Asha'man must learn the exercise known as the Flame and the Void, which is used to clear the mind, and focus on the trial at hand. 

To accomplish the void, the teacher must ask the student to clear his mind, and picture a flame in his head. When that has been done, he must attempt to form an effigy of his thoughts, emotions, and feelings, and "throw" them into the flames, and let the fires consume all, until nothing is left, except the blackness called the Void. To be realistic, this should take numerous tries until one can accomplish this. After the Void has been established, then the teacher may move on to grasping and releasing Sai
in. While in the Void, one is sensitive to Saidin's beckoning, which takes on the appearance and feel of a pale green light in the back of your mind. 

To grasp Saidin, the teacher must imbue the student with the fact that Saidin does not come easy; it is a battle of wills. To wrest the green light to you, which then feels like oil-slicked water, is to maintain an iron will, while in the comfort of the Void. Once you win control of Saidin, the feel of holding true Life in your hands, and holding ice and death, will happen, both at the same time. The oil-slick taint can be felt meshed with the water of Saidin. This is now called grasping Saidin. While gra
ping Saidin, sight and hearing abilities are both increased. Students should be taught nothing more in this lesson, except how to release Saidin. Once again, it is a battle of wills; the student must learn to force Saidin away, to the back of his mind, until safely letting go of it.

E
Beginner~
Begin with an introduction to the five threads of the One Power. The thread's flows can be seen extending from the channeler's body, while the observer grasps, by color and feel. One flow from the five types can be channeled as of now, until they learn to split their flows at a later lesson. Have the students gain a feel for each weave, and have them channel each until they are comfortable.

Fire  - The orange-red of a flame, in color. Used for burning, explosions, and in complex weaves.

Earth - The healthy brown of the soil, in color. Used for construction, destruction, and in complex weaves.

Air  - The light blue of the sky overhead, in color. Used for weather control, air manipulation, and in complex weaves.

Water - The dark blue of the oceans, in color. Used for weather control, water manipulation, and in  complex weaves.        

Spirit - The color of the purest white, that seems to pulse of its own life. Used as a building block for many complex weaves, and also to shield from the One Power.

----> Draft into Asha'man [Soldier]. Assignment of Chores.

After last lesson, a high-collared black coat and a black-handled blade are given. Assignment of chores is up to you, but must involve all use of the One Power. Student is hereby considered an Asha'man Soldier.

E
Allied~
Rand's Aiel - They serve Rand, and some even help on the Black Tower.

Band of the Red Hand - They serve Mat, who in turn serves Rand.

Legion of the Dragon - They serve Rand, help us recruit, and take all the ones that fail the test. (No Guild)

Two Rivers - They serve Perrin, who in turn serves Rand.

Saidin~
Saidin is like pure water. Tainted Saidin is oil mixed with that water. Taint is an oil slick. Men tend to lose control due to the taint, either dying in one bout of madness, usually causing many deaths around him, or slowly wasting away from the inside, his body rotting. It is rumored the M'Hael uses wine to passively remove these victims. 
~
E
Intermediate~
This lesson should cover every secondary detail about wielding and using the One Power.

Tying a Weave - Applicable to such weaves as shields, the channeler can tie the whole weave into knots, effectively cutting off the need for the channeler to maintain the flows for that weave. The weave will stay tied only for a time-depending on the strength of the weave and knot.

Splitting Flows - With training, Asha'man will learn to split their flows, through force of will. This allows for numerous weaves and complex weaves to be possible. 

Male vs. Female - Males are generally stronger in the One Power, adept at Fire and Earth. Women   generally tend to have more dexterity in weaving threads, adept at Air and Water.

Thread Affinity - Men and women of this age generally express innate ability in the usage of one or two threads of the One Power.
~
E
Heal~
Air, Water, and Spirit used to form a "complex weave" over the wound, to heal it. Both the strength of the healer and the one being healed are needed for this to work. People healed by men feel violated by a cold touch, and both are usually fatigued afterwards. The Asha'man's is a rather crude form.
~
E
Shield~
A weave of pure Spirit, placed over a person to shield them from grasping the One Power, or cutting their connection to it. Much harder to shield a person already grasping, and depends on strength.
~
E
Fireball~
A flow of Fire molded into a ball and covered in a shell of Air, which in then sparks the creation of an everyday fireball.
~
E
Wall~
\c03A flow of Air expanded and meshed out into a wall in front of you, held together by a frame made of Spirit. Can slow projectiles and weapons, and rare cases stop them altogether.\c00
~
E
Club~
\c03A strong flow of Air, enough Saidin to solidify it, and physically direct it at someone to bash, invisible to the eye.'\c00
~
E
Gate~
\c03Weave flows of Spirit to physically punch a whole in the pattern to your destination. You must know the location you are gating from well, as in spending at least a twenty minutes there, observing your surroundings. You can gate to any place, even those you have not been to before, because you can recognize thread locations, which make up the pattern, even though you don't know the real place.\c00
~
E
Unfolding~
\c03[Unfolding the Fan]: (defense) This is a circular parry. For a right-handed practitioner, the sword starts at about the 10 or 11 o'clock position and moves clockwise (a left handed practitioner starts at 1 or 2 o'clock). This parry, if properly timed, will knock away downward and diagonal attacks. It is best used in combination with other forms and maneuvers. Counters: Stones Falling Down the Mountain (either or both strikes).

[Kingfisher Takes a Silverback]: (low attack) A short, quick slash to the outside of the opponent's knee. The wrists instead of the arm should cause almost all of the sword's motion. This is a good maneuver to do as a counterattack, as the opponent's own motion makes the strike more harmful.

These two forms are taught together because they are an example of forms put together to create a bigger attack, in this case a defense form, and then a counterattack form. 

In teaching the institution of blade forms, remember that they are only guides, and there to help.
~
E
Bundling~
\c03[Bundling Straw]: (defense - counterattack) Sword held parallel to body, point up, and moves horizontally across the body, used to parry. Immediately after parrying, the sword slashes downward at the attacker's stomach and legs, moving in the opposite direction as before.

[The Falcon Stoops]: (counterattack) Though not a defense form, this is commonly used after a parry as a counterattack. Start with a quick fake to the side of the head (this should prevent the opponent from moving closer or attacking) and immediately follow with a step forward and a diagonal slash down the opponent's torso.
~
E
One~
A spar or battle against another Asha'man of equal or higher rank.
~
E
Soldier~
\c03After completing the WHOLE syllabus for Asha'man Soldier, the guild member may take the Asha'man Promotion Test. This may be performed by those of Asha'man rank only, and consist of testing the Soldier in all weaves, and blade forms he has currently learned, including knowledge of various things. Soldiers may readily fail the test, so do not assume passing is the only outcome.

Upon passing the test, and OOC consent of the majority of Instructors, the Asha'man will receive his silver sword pin, and be promoted to the rank of Asha'man [Dedicated].
~
E
Hostile~
Shaido Aiel - They serve a usurper of Car'a'carn, whom is Rand, therefore they are considered enemies. Their exact whereabouts are unknown.

Darkfriends - Any who worship and further the cause of the Dark is an enemy of a weapon of the Light. They reside in all societies of Randland. Some may have even corrupted our very ranks. The must be discovered and eliminated if we are to win.

Seanchan - They seek to invade our lands, enslave our peoples, considered hostiles. Come from a land across the Aryth Ocean.

Dragonsworn - Rabid band of poor farmers that follow a false prophet whom promotes foul deeds such as razzings and stealing. Considered hostile and should be loathed.
