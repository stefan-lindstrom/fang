*** ABOUT THE HOUSE : This house is owned by a
weathly merchant who travels the roads between
Caemlyn and Amador. A excellent businessman he
is often seen talking with strange foreigners
(most likely other merchants).
*** NOTE : You cannot level here or buy goods,
this house is used for rp purposes and you cannot
be dragged into rp. If, however you choose to be

*** NOTE: This house, while not a Children of the Light
guild area, is IC in nature and although you cannot be
forced into rp if you are here OOCly you will be asked
to leave.
*** ABOUT THE HOUSE : This house is owned by a wealthy
merchant who travels a great deal between Caemlyn, Lugard
and Amador. He is an agent for the HotL and this house is
used as both a meeting point and a safehouse for any Whitecloak
operations within Caemlyn. Due to it's secret nature all
Children must be very careful when entering and because of
this it would be very hard for the merchant to be discovered
as a agent (not impossible though).
