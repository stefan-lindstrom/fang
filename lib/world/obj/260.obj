This is a large city, with all sorts of people. Roleplay as well
as levelling is encouraged, and PLEASE keep in mind that
all non-levelling channeling, such as \c06Gate\c00 especially, can 
and will be roleplayed upon, as in the rest of the mud.

\c02NOTE\c00: Illian is being reworked slightly, with rooms being
arranged and whatnot. Please do not breathe in too much of our
dust, its not healthy =)

\c10These are the Laws of Illian:\c00 
Levelling is allowed in this area. So is rping. But beware: as with 
the rest of the mud, any \c09non-levelling channeling\c00 such as \c08gating\c00,
\c13creating food and water\c00, and related things are all \c12IC\c00. 
Feel free to level, but if you do any of the above \c06IC channeling\c00, 
and someone sees you, they have every right to rp as though they 
saw you doing those things \c05icly\c00 and act accordingly. 

\c11YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\c00
