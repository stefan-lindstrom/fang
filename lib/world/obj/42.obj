stone fountain water~
This stone fountain made of old marble looks quite old, yet it is filled
with water. In the center of the fountain is a small statue of a fish
shooting the water 10 feet into the air. The water seems to not ever
fall out of the fountain though. It is a beautiful fountain yet strange
looking.
