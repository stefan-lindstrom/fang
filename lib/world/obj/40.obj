ec3~
Any sort of RP that contains chanelling.  Requires presence of GL or Mistress, even if they do not participate in the RP itself.  Offer OOC suggestions for improvement of emotes.  If it is difficult to find mistresses or GL, log the RP and send to the GL.
~
E
ajah~
Spending a 'day' with a member of each ajah.  It is up to the Ajah members as to what is said and done, though the more you do, the more interest the Accepted could show in joining your ajah.  At the very least, explain the purpose of your Ajah, and why it is important to the Aes Sedai.
~
E
angreal~
Explain the three types of Angreal (Angreal, sa'Angreal, ter'Angreal) and how to use them.  Stress the dangers of using unknown Ter'angreal
~
E
otongue~
The basics of Old Tongue, such as what most Aes Sedai know.  Should consist of RP, and the IC study of the language by the Accepted.  Books can be attained from your local neighborhood NPC Brown, though if a PC one is online, she could be brought into the RP.
~
E
aweaves2~
These four weaves can be anything of the choice of the instructor and the Accepted.  However, keep in mind that most Accepted will not have the skills or talent for the most powerful of weaves like Gate and Heal Gentle, even if the student has the flows in code, such weaves should not be taught until the Shawl has been attained.
~
E
aweaves~
All accepted should be taught the following weaves before being raised to the Shawl.  Explain, Demontrate, have the Accepted form them themselves.

Simple Healing (even if they don't have the talent for it, show them how it is done in case of emergency situations.  Will only heal cuts and bruises.  Uses Water and spirit.

Slicing:  Slicing a weave before it reaches completion.  Requires quick reflexes and the use of Fire and spirit (instruct sliceweave or mail GL)

Shielding:  Shielding someone from the source.  Requires  large amounts of spirit instruct when complete.

Gentling/Stilling:  Cannot be done alone.  Usually requires a circle of 3 or more Aes Sedai.  Large amounts of  Spirit
~
E
battle~
Using the One Power in battle and other highly stressful situations.  Remind the Accepted that overfatigue can lead to burnout, and thus is not recommended.  In such situations, it is generally good to pace oneself and not do everything at once unless Absolutely necessary.   Also they should stop before they burn out, and if you have to choose between burnout and the life of a warder, choose the life.  A warder is there to protect you, and is freely willing to give his life for you.  Burning yourself out 
o save him will only leave you less powerful and leave him ashamed for his failure.
~
E
wards~
Explain what wards are and demonstrate how to form them.  Wards are used in protection.  Either keeps something our, or keeps something in.  All wards  require the use of spirit, though other flows vary depending on the type of ward.
~
E
relations~
Explain who our friends and our foes are and how to deal with them.  This list changes from time to time, but I will write here things as they stand at the time this is written.  If you see any major changes to this, notify the GL.

Tower:  Uneasy.  Respect them, but do not trust them.

Asha'man:  Hostile. Have a liking for kidnapping and bonding Aes Sedai.  Also note that they are male channelers and hence are dangerous and to most Aes Sedai, utterly repulsive.

Whitecloaks:  Foe.  A whitecloak will stop at nothing to see an Aes Sedai, whom they call 'witches' dead.  They feel the same about warders.

Nobility:  Most nobles respect Aes Sedai, but many cannot be trusted.


Hunters of the Horn:  Will often be nosy for information about the Horn.  Give them no such information.

Dragonsworn:  Hostile.  A group of fanatics that follows the 'prophet' and preaches the ways of the Dragon Reborn, and the evils of Aes Sedai.


Band of the Red Hand:  Uneasy Allies.  Egwene loves them, but most Aes Sedai are distrustful of them and their proximity, as they are just outside of Salidar, even to the point where some of the Sedai call them 'filthy Dragonsworn'

Aiel:  People from across the spine.  Have high respect for Aes Sedai in their history.  Shaido, however, are outright hostile.

Seanchan:  Foe.  Avoid if at all possible.  They leash female channelers and control them.  Slavery is a way of life to them, and they are unafraid to force an Aes Sedai into it.

Ogier:  Most are friendly and also respect Aes Sedai, though beware of those who actually wield weapons.  There are a couple of Ogier who are known to be in league with the Seanchan.

Tinkers:  Sneaky but mostly harmless.  Be friendly to them and deal with them, but do not trust them highly.

~
E
arules~
Rules of Conduct for an Accepted.  Should be given as soon as possible after her raising.

Curtsey to, respect and obey all Aes Sedai

Is allowed to have limited and PUBLIC contact with the males of the Tower.  Chores and studies, however, still come first.

Accepted chores shall include but not be limited to the following: Supervising Novices in organized chores such as kitchen work or outside labor, assigning chores and duties to Novices when the Mistresses or Sedai permit it or do not have time to do it themselves assisting the Sedai in whatever projects of studying (etc) they might require.

No Accepted is to ridicule or belittle a Novice, as confidence and strength is something which the Sedai alone are responsible for teaching to the Novices, and something which must not be undermined.
~
E
simple~
Simple weaves are those of one flow that can be taught to someone with the normal skill of a Novice.   The use of Instruct is encouraged.  Also please include which weaves were taught when mailing the Mistress or GL about the lesson.  A few examples of acceptable weaves are listed below, but any simple weave will do.

Create Water
Dart of Air
Wrap (though probably not strong enough to wrap a person)
Create fire (lighting candles, etc)
Minor refresh (spirit weave)
~
E
linking~
How to form a link with other Aes Sedai.  This should be done fairly close to the end of Novice training, as this takes time and control to learn.  Forming a link involves one person fully grasping the Power, and thus becomes the head of the link.  Then the others get READY to grasp Saidar, and hold that state, and the leader of the link will bring the others into the link by finishing the grasp through the readied members.  This lesson should first include how links work (one person leads, the others poi
t out dangers, and how the leadership can be transferred after the link is completed) as well as a demonstration.
~
E
tying~
How to tie off a weave.  Demonstrate to the Novice, and have her try.  Show how it holds the weave in place even though she's no longer maintaining the flows.
~
E
mc~
Explain about male channelers and the taint, and why they are dangerous.  Describe the events of the breaking of the world, and how the taint has already destroyed most of the known world at the time it happened.  Many Reds feel that all male chans that do not turn themselves in to be Gentled are darkfriends.  Point this out, and agree or disagree as your char would ICly.
~
E
shadowspawn~
Describe the different types of Shadowspawn, and explain the best ways to combat them.  For example, killing a Myrdraal will oftentimes help in the defeat of the trollocs he commands.  The types of shadowspawn that should be covered are:
Trollocs
Myrrdraal
Draghkar
Darkhounds
Grey Men
~
E
gaidin~
Explain about the Gaidin.  Who they are and what they do, and hence why they should be highly respected.  Also, explain about the bond and how it is handled.
~
E
ec2~
An OOC lesson about descriptiveness in channeling emotes.  Using emotes like 'forms the flows of healing to close the wound' is rather uninteresting.  Explain the use of cemote, and how it can be used to convey one emote in 3 different ways to other female channelers, to male channelers, and to non-channelers.  Explain how to make emotes interesting to everyone.  Like, for example:  'cemote weaves flows of fire and water to create a column of steam that appears to rise from the ground. #You feel the tingl
 of a woman channeling and suddenly a column of steam rises from the ground.#Suddenly, a column of steam rises from the ground.' shows as:

To female channelers: Name weaves flows of fire and water to create a column of steam that appears to rise from the ground.

To male channelers: You feel the tingle of a woman channeling and suddenly a column of steam rises from the ground.

To non-channelers: Suddenly, a column of steam rises from the ground.

Much more interesting than 'Name creates a weave to cause steam to rise from the ground.'  Also, include the use of the glow *how it gets brighter and dimmer with grasping amounts* and how hand and eye movements can also be used for descriptiveness and can be seen by non-chans.
~
E
ec1~
Is an OOC lesson on how to use the elements to form weaves. like using air to grab and move things, water to fill a cup, etc.  Also explain how if you're not sure what elements should form a weave, you can just think on what it does and use the necessary flows.  An example of this is making a ball of ice.  Water for sure, as you need to draw water out of the surrounding air or earth to use to make the ice, but how do you make it into ice?  One way is to use air and spirit, and 'stir' it into the water to 
ool it, an effective and more safe temperature manipulation than drawing the energy out with fire (as that causes you to absorb the energy and could cause the weaver to spontaneously combus if not careful).  Perhaps use air to hold the water into a nice ball shape by wrapping it around the water until it freezes. 
~
E
5elements~
This of course is to explain and demonstrate what the 5 elements of Saidar are, and how they are used.  Have the Novice try to form the flows one by one, and demonstrate them to her.

&WAir:&n  Manipulates Air of course.  Can be thickened to hold objects in place

&BWater:&n Manipulates water.  Mostly used in Healing

&yEarth:&n  Manipulates Earth and solid objects.  Often mixed with the other flows to strengthen and solidify weaves.

&RFire:&n  Manipulates energy.  Adding fire adds energy, removing it removes energy.  Useful for manipulating temperature.  Also used in highly destructive weaves.

&CSpirit:&n Is closest to the Source.  Is often used to restore or Heal living objects, as well as manipulate usage of the Power (slicing shielding, etc) as well as help manipulate spaces (like gating)
~
E
gnr~
A lesson that should teach the Novice how to grasp and release the Power.  This may have to be done more than once before it is successful.  Briefly reiterate the dangers, and demonstrate by saving the Novice grasp to the level of strain if she successfully grasps.  MAKE SURE they do not grasp too much.  Also make sure they know how to release and to not be tempted by Saidar's sweetness.  If this lesson is successful, the GL will raise the Novice's grasp and Release skills in code.
~
E
dangers~
The dangers and risks of using the One Power.  The consequences of grasping too much (like burnout).  A warning of how good it feels to Grasp and the control necessary to keep from wanting to grasp too much.  Also state the consequences of using too much and suffering fatigue.(headaches, weariness, difficulty in OP control)
~
E
hierarchy~
The command structure of the Aes Sedai.  Explain who the Amyrlin is And her rank, as well as those of the Keeper and the Sitters, and how they fall in the command structure (by rank, then by power, etc).  Also explain about the Heads of Ajahs, though they need not be named for obvious reasons.  Also note that the Aes Sedai can command Accepted and Novices, and Accepted can command Novices, though the latter only in a way that does not cause the Novice to break any rules.

~
E
etiquette~
This is a lesson in how a Lady comports herself in public.  Since Aes Sedai all know how to act like ladies, this training is important.  The things taught in this lesson should be done throughout the rest of the Novice's time in the Tower.  It should teach proper address, how to eat with the Nobles, how to dress, etc.  The eating habits especially should carry through, and the rest done when and if the Novice gets raised to the Shawl.  Can be done in an inn or a kitchen or wherever else you feel appropri
te.
~
E
nrules~
The purpose of this lecture is to outline the behavior expected of a Novice in the Rebel Tower.  The rules of behavior are as follows:

Curtsey to all Aes Sedai and Accepted

Be respectful to all others

Keep clothing and quarters clean and neat as much as possible

Do what they are told by Aes Sedai and Accepted

Do not be with Trainees unless told for an errand, then do so and leave them as quickly as possible.

Do not grasp Saidar without permission or supervision by a Sedai
