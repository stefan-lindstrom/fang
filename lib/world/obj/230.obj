Twenty years after the fall of malkier, the King of Cairhien did an extremely
foolish thing.  His country received a gift from the Aiel, five hundred years
previous.  This gift was a sappling from The Tree of Life, a fabled wonder,
left from the Age of Legends.  Laman, current King of Cairhien, had it cut into
pieces, and used the remains to construct a thrown of the gift.  Having
insulted the Aiel with his shameful act, four Aiel Clans crossed the Spine of
the world, or the Dragonwall, and entered the mainland, their mission, to kill
King Laman for his sin.  They swept through Cairhien like a wild fire, burning
and destroying all that they encountered.  They smashed any army that apposed
them, even the combined strength of multiple nations could not stand against a
third of the full strength of the Aiel.  Regularly punished on the field of
war, the armies of Illian, Tear, and many other nations, were forced back under
the shining walls of Tar Valon.  The shining walls of Tar Valon had never
fallen to an enemy, even Hawkwing's seage was broken by the power of the Aes
Sedai.  However, this was the Aiel nation, people born with war, and who lived
it from birth to death.  Under those unbreached walls, a war was fought, a war
given many names.  Some called it the Battle of the Shining Walls, some The
Blood Snow, but the Aiel gave it no name.  They fought the mainlanders for
three days and nights, moving through the armies of the assembled nations like
a bad wind.  On the third day, the news that the King of Cairhien was slain,
reached the fighting Aiel, and they began to disengage, retreating back to the
Waste, having completed their mission.  However, one of the warrior societies
of the Aiel consisted of women who forswore hearth and home to become warriors.
One of these women was formerly the Daughter-air of andor, a woman who had fled
her country by request of an Aes Sedai, to live with the Aiel.  The reasoning
for this became clear after the war was over, for the Maiden of the Spear
named, shaiel, meaning woman who is dedicated, had died on Dragonmount, and in
her death, she bore a child, who was later found by a Blademaster fighting for
Illian.  Tam Al'thor would take the baby home with him, knowing not the
prophecies that his son must needs fulfill.

Almost a thousand years after the death of Artur Hawkwing, the Blight began to
reawaken, as it had done on a few dreadful occasions in the past.  Yet, beyond
the Borderlands, beyond all normal signs of civilization stood the country of
Malkier.  The seven towers and thousand lakes of the Malkieri was all that
remained of the once great nation of Aramael, but it was the heart of that
great nation during the Trolloc Wars.  They lived as normal nations did but
with always the knowledge that they would have to fight the Shadow at every
step, every turn.  The betrayal of Malkier is long in the telling, but suffice
it to say that one of the closest advisors to the King, was seduced by a woman
who had a heart that burned with greed and envy.  This general, who was close
in the people's affections, to the King, stripped the Malkieri borderforts of
soldiers, to bring them back to the capital, to contend for the thrown.  The
King challenged his closest friend, the betrayer of Malkier, Cowin Fairheart,
to single combat, in which the King slew his friend, and kept the thrown for
his own.  Al'akar, King of Malkier was a King that only comes once in
generations, his leadership and wisdom renown throughout the Borderlands.  
Yet, Malkier's stripping of the border garrisons proved her undoing, for while
the thrown was being contended, Shadowspawn had overrun the weakened outposts,
striking deep into the heartland of the Malkieri.  Al'akar sent twenty of his
best personal guardsmen, with his infant son, south to Shienar, while he and
his wife led the Malkieri out to battle the shadowspawn.  The death of Malkier
was swift and ruthless, blood soaked mile after blood soaked mile given up at a
dreadful cost to the enemy.  Yet, the Malkieri were shattered at herot's
Crossing, and the seven towers were broken, the necklace of a thousand lakes
fouled by the Shadow.  The infant child was all that was left of the royal
family of Malkier.  He grew up knowing nothing but weapons, knowing nothing of
fun or games only of his enemy, the Shadow.  He is called by many names, Dai
shan, a Lord of the Seven Towers, Last Lord of the Malkieri, a Diademed Battle
Lord of the Malkieri, Aan'allein, One man or, a man who is a single nation, a
Warder, or simply Lan Mandragoran.  He is the best of the Warders and therefore
the best of all the fighters in the mainland.

The three hundred years of battle were over, the Light having defeated the
Shadow but not having won the war.  Peace would again return to the lands of
men, this time, with less and less knowledge of the glories of the Age of
Legends and the Covenant of the Ten Nations.  For seven hundred more years,
peace would reign again.  The lands were now more fragmented than before,
looking inward to their own affairs, rather than the betterment of all.  At the
end of the seven hundred year hiatus, a man was born, his name, Artur hawkwing,
his destiny, to reunite the world under one King, himself.  Artur Hawkwing
managed to do this, accepting country after country under his rule, fighting
some, but conquering all from the Aryth ocean in the west, to the Aiel Waste in
the east, from the Blight in the north, to the Sea of Storms in the south.  He
was the High King, all the countries under his rule known as city states with
their own governors.  The only power able to withstand Artur hawkwing was Tar
Valon, the Aes Sedai behind their shining walls throwing back every attempt to
take the island fortress.  Artur Hawkwing tried to take the Aiel Waste, but
after a few battles, he abandoned this plan of attack, having been completely
defeated in every battle by the now, devastatingly lethal Aiel clans.  After
Hawkwing had cemented his control over the mainlands, the Shadow, again,
stretched out a malevolent hand to affect the affairs of men.  Ishamael, taking
his shadow-like form, ranged out, seeking and finding Artur Hawkwing.  He
whispered in the great King's ear and Hawkwing laid seige to Tar Valon,
swearing that all Aes Sedai were Darkfriends.  Ishamael kept counselling Artur
Hawkwing, the ruler unaware of the true import of his actions.  Hawkwing, on
his death bed, made his generals swear to send his massive army across the
Aryth ocean, to take root on another continent.  He also made them swear that
they would seek out and destroy all Aes Sedai they could find.  So saying, he
died and the mighty empire that he had pain stakingly forged over more than two
decades, fell into ruin.  The city states claimed rulership of their own
territory, after Hawkwing's army left the mainlands.  One of Hawkwing's
generals returned to the city state of Caemlyn, with his wife, to establish the
creation of the country, now known as Andor.  The first ruler of Andor was a
Queen, and thus it has always been unto this day.  The cities of Illian,
Cairhien, Tear, Amador, amongst others, also formed their own countries, their
rulers either Kings or Queens, except for Tear, whose rulership fell to a
council of High Lords.  The War of the Hundred Years was now to begin, all of
the newly formed nations, snapping at one another, taking, losing and retaking
land, in attempts to gain more power and influence for themselves.  During this
war, even more knowledge of past triumphs and glories were lost, as war after
war saw the destruction of bloodlines and many old records.  At this time, a
group began to band together, calling themselves the Children of the Light.  
This group of pacific preachers, were like the Primitive Aiel in many cases,
following the ways of peace, choosing to do no violence.  And as with the Aiel,
circumstances forced them to shed their peaceful ways, and pick up weapons in
self defence.  Slowly, the ideals of the Children of the Light changed,
becoming more feverish in their search for Darkfriends and women who channel.
As with all of the wars predating the War of a Hundred Years, it finally came
to an end, national borders being drawn up, treaties being signed, allies made,
and peace beginning.

Peace reigned for nearly a thousand years, as the world regained it's footing
and set things aright, yet, as with the Age of Legends, it would not last.  
The great nations of the time, Manetheren, Aramael, Eharon, amongst others,
were content now, time having placed the Age of Legends and all the trials of
the Breaking, in the distant past.  Yet, the struggle of Light against Shadow
would not end, for one of the Forsaken, thought to be bound at Lews Therin's
sealing of the Dark One's prison, was not wholly imprisoned.  Whether Ishamael
was just more skilled than the rest, or was only half caught, he was able to
travel the world in an ethereal form, able to prod the Trollocs and Myrddraal
to organize, able to sow the seeds of dissension amongst the nations, able to
begin what would later be called the Trolloc Wars.  The Trollocs, Myrddraal,
Draghkar, and many other denizens of the northlands, whose ranks had swelled
enormously in a thousand years, marched from Shayol Ghul, led by the banner of
the Dark One himself, Ba'alzamon.  The trolloc Wars began, the Covenant holding
together barely, their massed armies meeting devastating charge after
devastating charge.  Many nations would fall in the three hundred years that
the Trolloc Wars lasted, the Covenant of the Ten Nations falling into ashes as
the sheer numbers of the Shadow overran the world once more.  One of the last
nations to fall was Manetheren, their King Aemon al Caar Al Thorin, a warrior
unmatched throughout the world, a man whose army was always in the thick of
battle against the Shadow.  The Red Eagle banner of Manetheren screaming out
it's defiance, was so often on the field of war, that people began thinking of
Manetheren's name, synonimous with a thorn to the Dark One's foot, a bramble to
his hand.  Yet, even the fearless, heart-breaking courage of Manetheren could
not halt the endless tides of Shadowspawn, and at a field in the lands of
Manetheren, later called emonds field, the King of Manetheren and the heart of
the fighting pride of the once great nation, was killed.  But in the very hour
of victory, as the ruins of once great nations smoldered and blew away as dust
on the wind, so the Shadowspawn achieved their destruction.  For in the city of
Manetheren, the Queen of the dying country, felt her husband die on emonds
field.  Driven to the point of madness by grief and despair, she drew on the
One Power, drew more than she could possibly handle unaided, and threw all of
that terrible obliterating fire at the forces ravaging her home.  As she died,
wreathed in flames, among the ruins of Manetheren, a power visited every
Shadowspawn in manetheren.  Where ever the Dredlords were, they died in flames,
where ever the Myrddraal and Trollocs were within the boundaries of Manetheren,
they fled in horror as wild fire mercilessly pursued them, first shattering,
then killing the remnants of the army.  The broken tatters of the Shadowspawn
host fled from Manetheren, and the final vengeance came, as armies from other
countries, finished what Manetheren had paid such a high price to accomplish.
Nothing remained of Manetheren, only a few people where once there were
millions.  The great country of Manetheren would never rise again, The Red
Eagle, the sword that could not be broken would remain only within the memories
of scholars and within the pages of history books.  The remains of the thorn in
the Dark One's foot remained around Emonds field, continuing to tend their
farms for 2,000 years, slowly the world even forgetting the existence of the
country that once was.

The death of Lews therin Telamon came early in the Breaking.  In his death
throws, he called down a mighty blast of power to smote him where he stood, on
an endless rolling field of grassland.  A mountain was created where he was
struck, the ground heaving it into existence,a mountain as black as the day of
his death, a mountain that would cast a shadow across a river and over an
island that would be where the Aes Sedai began again.  This mountain would be
called Dragonmount, the place of the Dragon's rebirth, while the island would
be named Tar Valon, the tower that guards, awaiting his coming.  The struggle
to survive went on for an unspecified amount of time, likely a hundred years.
Eventually, the land was still again, the danger of Shai'tan sealed by Lews
Therin Kinslayer, the male Aes Sedai dead for all time, or so they hoped.  
Peace began to reawaken grudgingly, for the lands were no longer in harmony as
once was.  Nations were formed along the north of the continent, their task, to
defend against a strip of land known as the Blight, the remnant of the Shadow.
The Blight would come to contain creatures of darkness, left over inventions
from the War of Power, creatures that would cost many lives to defeat and
banish.  Slowly, the world began to rebuild itself, forming the Covenant of the
Ten Nations, all of them mighty, all of them allies sworn against the Shadow.
The power and influence of the Aes Sedai grew to the point where many nations
would not have an Aes Sedai advisor, for they had sworn three oaths, to speak
no word that is not true, to make no weapon for one man to kill another, and to
not use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last
defense of her life, the life of her Warder, or that of another Aes Sedai.  
Warders were a group of highly trained, extremely disciplined fighters, who
were sworn shields of the Aes Sedai.  Using the One Power, an Aes Sedai could
place a bond on her Warder, allowing him to sense his Sedai, as well as the
ability to go without food, drink, or sleep for long periods of time.  The Aes
Sedai's advantage from the bond is a closely kept secret but it is rumored that
they can freely draw upon the physical strength of their Warder, allowing them
to go without rest for longer periods of time.  The Aes Sedai built their White
Tower, in the center of Tar Valon, the new center of Aes Sedai power.  They
began to influence nations and direct the effort of peace, but they also began
to scheme and manipulate, receiving a bad reputation by the small folk of the
world.

aiel~
The Aiel travelled for centuries after the sealing of Shai'tan's prison, their
numbers slowly dwindling as bands of people gone savage, constantly attacked
their camps and wagons.  Eventually, the Aiel were forced into a wasteland, far
to the east and across a massive mountain range called the Spine of the World.
Soon after entering the waste, they found the pledge of peace would not hold.
Constant raids on their encampments, forced a huge number of the aiel to split
from the main body.  These Aiel kept their contempt for swords, but they took
up spears in their own defence, lopping off much of the length, until they had
a four foot spear, steel tipped and deadly quick.  They also adopted the
weapons of bow and long bladed knife, as well as training with hands and feet
in unarmed combat.  These massive groups of Aiel would further break apart,
eventually forming twelve clans, the Chareen, Codarra, Daryne, Goshien,
Miagoma, Nakai, Reyn, Shaarad, Shaido, Shiande, Taardad, and Tomanelle.  These
clans would come to know the waste as the Three Fold Land, a constant testing
ground of their courage and strength.  The group that held to the Way of the
Leaf, the pledge of peace, were called the Jenn Aiel, the truly dedicated.  
They still had more numbers than all of the groups who had split from the
whole, but every day, the ranks of the violent clans swelled and the numbers of
the jenn diminished, as the hard, ruthless land that they inhabited was
unsuited to their civilized ways.  Finally, the Jenn made their stand, building
a massive city in the waste, placing all the treasures, given to them by the
Aes Sedai, within for safe keeping.  Two Aes Sedai who were still with the
Jenn, placed a perpetual cloud of fog around what would become the city of
Rhuidean, the true testing ground of the Aiel.  The Jenn called a council of
the leaders of all the clans of the Aiel, to meet what was left of the Jenn, at
Rhuidean.  The tribal leaders, still having no solid ties or specific titles
that named them true leaders of their people, came to Rhuidean and heard the
words of the Aes Sedai.  Rhuidean would become a testing for the Aiel.  Any who
wished to become Clan Chief of a clan or Wise One for a clan, must enter it's
fog shrouded confines and learn the full history of the Aiel.  Although none
but the Aes Sedai knew it at the time, another man would come, born of the
blood but not of the blood, raised by the old blood, the Dragon Reborn, the
last saviour that the Creator would spin into the pattern, to save mankind.  
The purpose of Rhuidean was for the Aiel, to organize them and prepare them to
follow the Dragon Reborn, when he came, but it was also for the Dragon Reborn,
to give him the forbidden knowledge of the Aiel, and to help him in his
struggle that would begin 2,000 years later.  The Aes Sedai, both men and
women, worked in harmony through the last years.  Foretelling, a talent that
came in fits and seizures, giving the observer partial glimpses of the future,
informed the Aes Sedai that Lews Therin would, again be reborn, to fight a
final battle sometime in the distant future.  To prepare against this day, they
built a mighty fortress called the Stone of Tear, and placed within it one of
the most powerful objects that enhanced the power, Callandor, a Sa'angreal.  
The sword that is not a sword, was warded by the power of the Aes Sedai, so
that no hand but Lews Therin reborn would be able to pull it from it's
confines.  Having completed this task, they sent the Aiel with all their
treasures, to find a place and await the Dragon's rebirth, and having scribed
all of the prophecy that could be seen, the male Aes Sedai slowly dwindled and
died out, while the female Aes Sedai began anew.

The consequences of the counter-stroke, affected all male channelers, driving
some immediately mad, while others managed to handle the taint for a few years.
Still, before the male Aes Sedai, who once brought prosperity and life to the
world, could die, they smashed all around them, smashing whole cities and
destroying miles of land around themselves in obliterating blasts of power.  
Then, what is now called the Breaking of the World, began, for the very
foundations upon which the world stood, were changed, and This change was
sudden, violent, and deadly.  As the world began to break apart and the people
began to scatter to all ends of the planet, in vane attempts to find shelter
and peace, Lews Therin, fully wrapped in madness, returned to his home, and
began to destroy all around him, killing his wife, and children and all his
friends, who had been there through the years of bitter war.  Ever after this
day, he would be known as the Kinslayer, the man who broke the world, the
Dragon of prophecy.  The war was over, ten years of bloody, horrific, bitter
struggle, completed and won for the Light, but the cost was tremendous.  The
Age of Legends would end in the following years, the glories and marvels of
countless generations, vanishing like a mirage as knowledge and technology,
disappeared when the lands began to shatter and people and hope began to die.
The Ogier, the gentle giants that were only humanoid in shape but long lived
unlike humans, and allies of the Light throughout the war, vanished into their
Steddings, peaceful abodes that offered protection from the madness and chaos
of the outside world.  Many male Aes Sedai went with the Ogier, the Steddings
blocking the ability to channel, and therefore allowing the accursed men to
live awhile without fear of a rotting death.  However, these men, who had so
recently been the strongest influences across worlds, soon left the Ogier
sanctuaries, unable to resist the call of the power and the need to channel it.
The Nym, born of the forests, whose bodies were made of bark and leaf and who
were brothers to the Ogier, slowly began to die out, their immortality gone at
the end of the war.  Only one of the Nym would survive the cataclysm, his task,
to guard a pure pool of Saidin known as the Eye of the World.  The Aiel,
Dedicated in the Old Tongue, the servants of the Aes Sedai, pledged to peace,
sworn never to lift a weapon in anger or defence, fled with the treasures of
the Aes Sedai, objects given into Aiel trust, for safe keeping, while the world
broke around them.

war~
The event that was to begin the conflict between the forces of good and evil
was the bore, the hole drilled by Lanfear and another Forsaken, into the prison
of the Dark One.  This action caused the war to begin immediately, for although
Shai'tan was still constrained in the prison, his hand could reach out and
affect the world.  Lews Therin martialled the forces of the Light, it's
backbone as the Aes Sedai, and it's regular troops as newly trained soldiers.
No violent crime had been committed for a long period of time before the war,
thus the need for troops was non- existent, which put the Light at a distinct
disadvantage at the beginning of the war.  The Forsaken began to construct
their own army, using powers from the Dark One and their own twisted skill, to
form creatures of nightmarish aspect.  Chiefly among these experiments were
Trollocs, creatures grown from humans bred with select animals, Myrddraal,
unnatural creatures, whose eyeless visage and complete ruthlessness, struck
fear into the hearts of the staunchest fighters, Draghkar, winged creatures who
could hypnotize with a glance, Darkhounds, who were death walking in the shape
of a wolf, Gray men, men who had given away their souls, in order to become
assassins for the Shadow, and Gholam, creatures unaffected by the power in any
form, bred to kill Aes Sedai specifically.  The war began, the Light with the
Aes Sedai and soldiers drawn from the land, against the Shadow with all it's
twisted evil.  The war lasted a bloody ten years, desperate battle fought after
desperate battle, the Light losing almost every confrontation.  Slowly the Aes
Sedai began to understand the full implications of their dilemma, and they
began to construct objects of the power to aid them in their feverish struggle.
These objects had always been made by Aes Sedai.  Known as Angreal, Ter'angreal
and Sa'angreal, these objects allowed the wielder to draw more of the One
Power, greatly increasing the wielder's effectiveness.  These power multipliers
were Angreal and Sa'angreal, while Ter'angreal changed the way the One Power
was used, modifying it rather than multiplying it.  Yet, not even these new
weapons were able to stop the advance of the Shadow, city after city, country
after country, falling into darkness and despair.  During the last two years of
conflict, Lews Therin proposed to the rest of the Aes Sedai, that they pool
their strength, to strike one massive blow at the heart of the conflict, the
bore at Shayol Ghul, the location of the Dark One's prison.  This plan managed
to split the Hall of Servants into two armed camps, the supporters of Lews
Therin, mostly consisting of men, while the other camp argued that they
continue fighting as they had done before.  Finally, Lews Therin decided to end
The War of Power by his own means, without permission from the Hall.  His band
of Aes Sedai, now called the Hundred Companions, as well as a group of 10,000
military men, led by Lews Therin, struck at the heart of the Shadow.  As it
happened, all thirteen forsaken were at the bore, holding a council of some
sort.  Lews therin's attack caught them completely off-guard, and before the
forsaken could strike, they were bound and sealed when Lews Therin and his
Hundred Companions sealed the Bore on the prison.  The ramifications of Lews
Therin's actions would be immediately felt, as all who struck and sealed the
Dark One, were grabbed and smashed by the Dark One's counter-stroke.  Instead
of striking at the Aes Sedai themselves, the Great Lord of the Dark tainted the
male half of the True Source, effectively placing a curse upon the male Aes
Sedai of madness and a death from rot.  All the male channelers at the sealing,
went instantly insane, turning what was a glorious victory, into nothing but
ashes.

I must digress at this point to relate some events that occurred, leading up to
the discovery of the Dark One.  Mierin Sedai, a woman, who was Lews therin's
childhood lover, burned with ambition and lust for power.  She was slighted at
the hands of Lews Therin, or so she believed, for her lover turned away from
her, disgusted with her ambition, and fell into the arms of another woman.  
From this day forth, Mierin would always hate Ilyena Moerell, later to be Lews
Therin's wife.  Unsuccessful in her attempts to recapture Lews Therin's heart,
she turned away from the light, forswore her oaths as a protector of all that
was good, and swore her allegiance to Shai'tan, her new and dark master.  
After swearing her new oaths, she would always be known as Lanfear, Daughter of
the Night.  Semirhage was one of the most powerful healers of the age, her
skill and notoriety known throughout the world.  After bringing her patients,
back from the brink of death, she would extract a price from them, this price
taking the form of torture for her own pleasure.  The hall of Servants gave her
an ultimatum of either being stilled, severed from the One Power, and outcast,
or being bound in some way, with the power, leading a life of contemplation,
able to see the end of life approach.  She was one of the first women to flee
to the Dark Lord, and forswear her oaths to the Light.  The life of Demandred
can be summed up with a brief statement, he was always second.  He never gained
any significant fame for the Light, or was exalted for miracles he performed,
and the reason for this was Lews Therin.  Next to the Dragon, Demandred was
just another Aes Sedai, but if the Dragon had not been born, Demandred would
have been the most powerful man of the age.  Always envying Lews Therin's fame
and glory, he turned a bitter side up, and also fled to Shai'tan to swell the
ranks of the Shadow.  Be'lal and Sammael were both Aes Sedai, even when the war
broke out with the forces of evil, commanding armies along side Lews Therin.  
Yet, envy and greed burned in these two men, almost as strongly as in the
turned Aes Sedai, and they also abandoned the Light for the Shadow.  Graendal
the psychologist, Ishamael the philosopher, Mesaana the teacher, Moghedien the
spider, Asmodean the bard, Aginor and Balthamel the envious, and Rahvin the
seeker of lust, all left the ranks of the Light, to fight for the Dark One.  
These thirteen, former Aes Sedai, thirteen of the strongest channelers of the
Age, only a step below Lews Therin, now known as the Forsaken, would not be the
only ones to forswear oaths.  Lesser Aes Sedai, later known as Dredlords, as
well as men and women who were greedy for power and enticed by the Dark One's
offer of immortality, left the Light, and from these ranks, the army of the
Shadow was formed.

During this prosperous age, one of the most powerful Aes Sedai ever, was born
and later, came to prominence, his name was Lews Therin Telamen, the Dragon.  
He was unique beyond being Aes Sedai, for he was a Ta'veren.  The easiest
method of describing Ta'veren is to say that they are a focal point for the
pattern, someone with the ability to manipulate events around himself, to a
degree, that is most often not understood or controlled.  In effect, the
Ta'veren has events go his way more often than not, though it is not something
that should be relied upon, for it is very inconsistent.  In any event, Lews
Therin was a man that would rock the foundations of the world, for he was the
most powerful of the Aes Sedai, the most powerful Ta'veren and due to this, he
had more power and influence than many rulers of the age.  It is not known how
long Lews Therin led the Aes Sedai before destruction occurred but as Aes Sedai
led lives more than 500 years long, it could be any significant amount of time.
At any rate, he ruled and the land prospered, until a group of slighted Aes
Sedai began to uproot some secrets that would affect all time.  Chiefly among
these secrets was the existence of a power, equal in strength to the Creator,
known as Shai'tan, or the Great Lord of the Dark.  This divinity had been
sealed in a prison at the moment of creation, destined to lead an existence cut
off from the world, with no influence or control.

introduction~
Introduction As you might have guessed, Dragon's Fang is based on a series of
books, written by Robert Jordan, known as the Wheel of Time.  The series began
in 1990, with The Eye of the World, and has continued through to the eighth
book, Path of Daggers, published in late 1998.  To play Dragon's Fang, it is
not imperative that you read the books, but it will help tremendously when you
interact with other players.  These books are extremely popular so finding them
will not be difficult.  If you do not wish to go through all the reading, and
just want an outline of the books, in order to play the game, you have found
it.  Within this document, is a brief history of the books, but beware, there
are approximately 6,500 pages in the series, so this document will be as short
as I can possibly make it.  This is a chronological accounting of events known
in the Wheel of Time, thus, this document will not begin with the Eye of the
World, but with the events that preceded it by 3000 years.  Our story begins
with paradise, or as close to it as we can believe.  This paradise was called
the Age of Legends, when all things were possible, including travelling to
other worlds.  The creator of a large part of the marvels of the Age of Legends
was a group of select humans called Aes Sedai.  These humans were a guild of
sorts, devoting their magical talents to serving mankind.  The name Aes Sedai,
in the Old Tongue, means Servant of All, but as with most things connected with
power and influence, the servant part of the name, begins to slip, and is
replaced with something akin to ruler of all.  To explain their power would be
long in the telling, but suffice it to say that they draw their power from the
primal forces that turn the Wheel of Time.  These two powers known as Saidin,
the male half, and Saidir, the female half, drive the wheel that shapes the
pattern, the pattern being the structure of the universe.  Drawn from these two
sources of power, is what makes Aes Sedai unique.  The One Power is an
elemental force, split into five flows, air, fire, water, earth, and spirit.  
Melding these flows together, Aes Sedai were able to heal lethal wounds, travel
to other planets, delve deep into the secrets of the mind, spread peace
throughout the lands, and make many fair things prosper.  As with most things
that approach perfection or complete harmony, it would not last, and those many
fair things would fade and wither under the heels of ambition and greed.

Citizens of Aringil.  We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.  Andor has
attempted, with the utmost of diplomacy, to avoid hostilities with the nation
of Cairhien.  However, it has come to pass that a state of war exists between
the two mighty countries.    
Due to this unfortunate event, the Queen's Armies will have a temporary
headquarters within the limits of Aringill. This Headquarters is the new 
building direct northeast of the square. 

The Mayor

(ooc) the area northeast of this sign, is completely ic. Anyone who wishes to
rp within it, must therefore, be so. 
Thanks
