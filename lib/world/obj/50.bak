The Nature of the Seals on the Dark One's Prison

A Theory by Siomaydra Demieynn
        During the course of my studies, I came across several entries in
books mentioning the seals that seal the Dark One within his prison.  As most
know, the seals were used as focal points to reseal the Dark One in prison,
along with the Forsaken, by Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.
~
E
page2~
The Dark One's counterstroke caused the taint on Saidin, and led to every
male Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends going mad, beginning the Time of Madness
and the Breaking of the World.  However, in all of the mentionings made by
various scholars concerning the seals, none ever intimated how they worked,
or more definitively, the nature of what makes them work, or indeed the
very nature of the seals themselves.  It is here, in these pages, that I will
~
E
page3~
propose various theories concerning the nature of the seals, the nature of
what makes them work, and how they work.
        It is well known - or should be - that the seals are made of 
cuendillar, a substance made with the One Power that is unbreakable.  The 
making of cuendillar is of course lost to us, along with so much else, but
is our understanding of cuendillar?  By this, I mean, how much do we honestly
~
E
page4~
know of the substance, apart from that it was made through the One Power, is
unbreakable, and is very rare in today's society?  Perhaps it is in our
understanding of the very nature of cuendillar which lies our key to learning
of the nature of the seals.  Thus, I have endeavoured to study cuendillar, 
the findings of which follow:
~
E
page5~
        1.  It is made through the One Power.
        2.  It is unbreakable.
        3.  Attempts to break cuendillar only seem to make it stronger, though
            that comment in itself is slightly incorrect given the statement
            of point 2.  Something already unbreakable should not be made
            stronger, or even weaker, but should logically remain the same,
~
E
page6~
            or at least bear no change.
        4.  Cuendillar was shapeable, somehow, during the Age of Legends,
            since there are many artifacts surviving today which bear various
            shapes.
        Given the above points, I draw the reader's attention to point 4.  If
~
E
page7~
cuendillar was indeed shapeable, how was such shapeing achieved?  The obvious
answer is through the One Power.  However, such attempts made by myself proved
unsuccessful.  This simply could be a lack of knowledge, of course, but I
have another theory.  Perhaps cuendillar was not actually made and then
shaped.  Perhaps, instead, objects were made, and then formed into cuendillar.
This would seem far more logical, given the variety of objects of cuendillar
~
E
page8~
that exist today.  Perhaps, through the One Power, normal everyday ores and
materials can be 'cuendillarised', a term I will use to represent this belief.
        Now, considering this, it is probable that the seals, when
cuendillarised, were done so imperfectly, which would explain their weakening
in recent times.  However, this raises the question of why other cuendillar
objects also do not weaken.  Surely imperfect cuendillarisation could not
~
E
page9~
simply be a once off occurrence?  Perhaps it was!
        Consider some key things we know of the Age of Legends: the greatest 
feats of the One Power were accomplished by men and women working together; 
the sealing of the Bore was accomplished by only male Aes Sedai.  Given these
two factors, we can logically assume that the female Aes Sedai of the time
were either a) not informed of the action that would be taken by the male Aes
~
E
page10~
Sedai, in advance, and thus had no part in it, or b) the female Aes Sedai of
the time took no part in male Aes Sedai's strike because they did not
countenance it.  This would indicate that, based on my theory of 
cuendillarisation of common materials, the male Aes Sedai cuendillarised the
seals that would be used as focal points for the Dark One's prison alone,
without the aid of female Aes Sedai.  This seems to lend weight to the theory
~
E
page11~
of imperfect cuendillarisation of the seals, as mentioned above.
        However, since we do not know how cuendillar was actually made, this
theory is simply that, a theory.  Perhaps if we knew more, we might be able
to work out the reason for why the seals weaken as they do.  If my theory
was correct, however, it may be that the cuendillarisation process was only
part way completed, and thus over time the seals have weakened due to lack of
~
E
page12~
completion of the process.  This makes me wonder whether Aes Sedai of our time
could perhaps complete the cuendillarisation process, and thus strengthen the
seals on the Dark One's prison.  Perhaps this will be rediscovered before 
Tarmon Gai'don.  I believe, though, that the seals will play a large part in
the Dark One's resealment into his prison, regardless.  Perhaps knew seals
will be made, successfully.
~
E
page13~
        That is my theory on the nature of the seals themselves, as physical
entities, and one reason as to why they may be weakening.  However, what of
the question of the nature of how the seals work?
        Consider what we know of the seals already:
        1.  They are made of cuendillar.
~
E
page14~
        2.  They are unbreakable.
        3.  They are weakening.
        4.  They are the focal points that hold the Dark One within his
            prison, along with the Forsaken.
        5.  They were placed by male Aes Sedai.
~
E
page15~
        Logically, point 1 should not be the reason they work as they do.  If
that were so, simply because they are cuendillar, we would be able to use any
cuendillar artifacts we have as seals.  Points 2 and 3 conflict, and thus
will be glazed over in this part of the discussion; they bear no significance
in the nature of how the seals work.  This leaves points 4 and 5 as possible
answers to the nature of how the seals work.
~
E
page16~
        Point 4 is more a statement of the seals' function, however, looking
deeper into this statement, it is a possibility that their function is part
of their nature.  Or, more succinctly, their function and nature are closely
linked.  Examine, for a moment, the purpose of the seals:  To keep the Dark
One and the Forsaken within the Bore, to seal it.  Could it be that the 
nature of the seals draws on their purpose?  To continue their purpose, 
~
E
page17~
perhaps the seals must draw on the evil that is the Dark One, and also his
minions, the Forsaken.  But then, why are the seals weakening?  
        I propose the belief that the Dark One is pure evil, the essence of 
evil.  Also, I propose that the Forsaken, although evil and deep in the 
Shadow, are not as evil as the Dark One, nor the essence of evil that the 
Dark One is.  Using this as the basis for my theory, consider the possibility
~
E
page18~
that the Dark One has managed to use the non-evil (I hesitate to use 'good')
parts of the Forsaken as a buffer to the seals.  This answers the question of
both the nature of the seals - drawing on the evil of the Dark One to
maintain their purpose - and the question of why they are weakening - because
the Dark One perhaps has somehow managed to 'starve' the seals of the evil
that keeps them continueing their purpose.  
~
E
page19~
        This theory also draws on the information cited by many authors that 
the Forsaken were sealed after the Dark One was, sealed closer to the real 
world, and thereby the ever weakening seals.
        Another theory as to the nature of how the seals work is the belief
that the seals somehow draw on the One Power.  Entertaining this notion, I
can theorise that the taint on Saidin plays a large part into the reason of
~
E
page20~
why the seals are weakening.  Point 5 above tells us that the seals were
placed by men only, which means Saidin was used.  Saidin which is tainted by
the Dark One's touch.  Saidin, which may provide the strength of the seals; 
and conversely, the taint of the Dark One.  If this is the case, then as time
goes by, with the seals drawing on the One Power to operate, they are also
suffering from a build up of the taint, just as a man who channels does.
~
E
page21~
        Consider this picture:  A man who channels eventually goes mad with
the taint, and suffers from a rotting sickness.  If, indeed, the seals draw
on Saidin to operate, could they not also suffer from a rotting sickness,
thereby causing them to weaken?  I think this is quite probable.  However, 
since it is unknown whether or not such a thing can be set up (an object
constantly drawing on the Power to operate), I must wonder if it is possible.
~
E
page22~
But, then, tied off flows perhaps could have been used, as they were to
guard Callandor all these years.  Though, of course, a Warding and an object
drawing on the Power are entirely different.
        Now, turning the direction of discussion to that of how the seals
work.  I have already discussed the nature of how the seals work, which is
similar to how the seals work, but, not entirely the same in my point of
~
E
page23~
view.  How do the seals do what they do?  How do the seals maintain a closure
to the Dark One's prison?  Do they work similar to mortar between stones?  Or
do they work as a clasp on a gate?  Do the seals focus on the prison as some
kind of impervious sphere, a sphere which is the Dark One's prison?  All of
these questions remain largely unanswered.  However, I will try to answer 
them now, with my own theories.
~
E
page24~
        Taking into account what we already know of the seals, that they are
focal points on the Dark One's prison, I have to logically conclude that the
seals themselves are NOT his prison.  If the seals themselves were the Dark  
One's prison, it would seem probable that with the destruction of one, a way
would be open to the Dark One to destroy the rest of the prison.  This means 
that something else is his prison, and that the seals act similarly to a 
~
E
page25~
hinge or mortar; something that seems far more likely.  As the seals weaken,
so does the hinge, or the mortar, slowly rusting, or crumbling.
        Given this, it seems likely that other focal points could be made to
replace the rusting hinge, the crumbling mortar.  But do the current seals 
need to be destroyed entirely before this can happen?  I hope it is not so.
        Now that I have answered the questions I set out to answer, or at
~
E
page26~
least provide some theory on, I must make clear that these theories are just
that.  From the study I have done, I feel confident in the theories I have
made within this discussion.  In some instance, I pray that I am wrong,
however; in others, I pray that I am right.  Drawing on logic to conclude
much of what I have presented has not necessarily always led to what we
wish to hear, or what we hope to be true.  
~
E
page27~
        But based in logic can we hope to provide answers to questions which 
remain unanswered.  In logic, can we hope to find the truth of many of these
questions.  In hope.

An Overview to the Aes Sedai in Tar Valon

by Zherza Sedai
-----------------------------------------
Here at the White Tower in Tar Valon women are trained to Channel the One
Power. They are trained by fully-trained Channelers, who are called Aes 
Sedai. There were male Aes Sedai in the past, but now only women are 
trained to Channel.
~
E
page2~
Few people are born with the ability to learn to Channel, and even fewer 
with what is termed 'the spark'.  Those who are born with the spark will 
Channel whether they wish to or not, though these women only have a one in
four chance of surviving, and those that do, usually form a block against
what they are doing. In both cases, the ability does not manifest itself 
until puberty. Those women with the ability to learn will never Channel
~
E
page3~
unless they are trained at the White Tower. Born Channelers who survive 
the effects of coming into their ability untutored learn a rough control
over the One Power, but will never have the abilities of a full Aes Sedai
unless they are trained. We call such women "Wilders".
~
E
page4~
Three thousand years ago, during the Age of Legends, male and female
Aes Sedai worked together to create many wonders with the One Power. But
the Dark One escaped from his prison in Shayol Ghul, creating a risk to all
of mankind. Once the Dark One was free of his prison, he subverted thirteen
of the most powerful channelers of the time, whom we now call the Forsaken.
The One Hundred Companions, a group of 100 male Aes Sedai, were able to 
~
E
page5~
reseal the Dark One's prison, but as a result, saidin, the male half of 
the True Source, was tainted forever more, which led to the Breaking of
the World.

This taint is similar to an oil slick on water. The water - saidin -
is pure, but it can't be touched without touching the oil - the taint. The
taint caused all of the male Aes Sedai to die of a rotting disease like
~
E
page6~
leprosy, or go mad, using their abilities in deadly ways. The earthquakes
and lightning bolts they Channeled in their madness Broke the World, 
changing the entire known landscape and killing millions. That was the end
of the Age of Legends.

Since that time, there have been no trained male Aes Sedai. Those men
born with the ability to Channel still suffer from the effects of the taint
and go mad or die of the rotting disease. Those of the Red Ajah dedicate
~
E
page7~
themselves to hunting down these men and permanently cutting them off from
the Source, as their madness is a risk to all around them because of their 
ability to Channel.

Male Channelers are very rare, and considered horrors or dangers throughout
the world. Prophecies foretell that the Dragon Reborn will be a Channeler. 
The Dragon is destined to combat the Dark One at the Last Battle. (Although
~
E
page8~
it will be the Tower that will guide the Dragon Reborn to Tarmon Gai'don, 
and the Tower that will stand ready to fight in Tarmon Gai'don.  It is the
Tower which shall return triumphant, and the Aes Sedai to whom the people
will owe their salvation).
~
E
page9~
Periodically, a man declares himself the Dragon Reborn, attracting
supporters.  Foes also rise up against him, and wars are often started in
this way. Not all of these False Dragons can Channel, but those who can are
captured by us and "gentled", their ability to Channel permanently 
removed. This may sound cruel and harsh, but it must be realised we do 
this for the benefit of the world. The Breaking was a most terrible thing
~
E
page10~
and it was caused by male channelers going mad.  Hence, the only rational 
course open to us is to gentle these channelers, thus saving the lives of 
millions in the process.

After the Breaking of the World, people naturally became mistrusting of 
the One Power and its users, so even female Channelers are regarded with 
suspicion by most people and wrongly so.  We take the 3 Oaths and help 
~
E
page11~
save the world by gentling males who can channel and dedicating ourselves
to fighting the Dark One and his evil forces.  However, people still 
mistrust us. It would seem some people just do not share the same insight
an Aes Sedai does but then how could we expect them to? 
~
E
page12~
Several countries have laws against Channeling within their borders. In 
most places, when a woman manifests the ability to Channel, she is 
immediately sent to us here at the White Tower for training, regardless of
her position in life (and may I add that it is a blessing that people at
least see some wisdom).  Were channelers allowed to walk around freely 
without having been trained first, they would surely cause another 
~
E
page13~
Breaking or be become slaves to the will of the Dark One. Only in Tar 
Valon and the Borderlands are Aes Sedai accepted, and Andor sends all its 
heirs to the throne to the White Tower for schooling.

Ebou Dar is the largest city in Altara, and home to the Tarasin

Fishing is probably the most common occupation in the city.

Men wear square-cut beards and long mustaches. They wear long,
colourful vests, with no shirt, or a pale, wide-sleeved shirt.
Noblemen wear small silk coats as capes slung across their shoulders.
Otherwise, men and women wear the same styles whether they are noble
or commoner, the clothing of nobles being made from finer cloth and
more elaborately embroidered.
~

Altarans are of average height, with a medium skin tone. Most have
dark hair and dark eyes. Women wear their hair to their shoulders, or
even shorter. They wear pale dresses with deep, narrow necklines.
Their skirts are gathered up to the knee on one side to display
colourful petticoats. Married women wear a marriage dagger at their
throats, and the colour and gem settings of the dagger is a code that
indicates marital status and information about their children.

Altara has a reputation for being a violent, unsavoury place,

the west. It is not a particularly powerful nation. The ruler has
little power, and many of the Noble Houses have no qualms about

great there is no word for Wisdom in this country and any woman who

The King rules from the Seranda Palace, located two miles outside of
Amador. The Children of the Light were founded in Amadicia, and have

Many Amadicians have dark hair. The women often wear their hair in

bows, and often have matching bows on their dresses. Men wear long
coats to their knees.

The Two Rivers area, made up of the villages of Emond's Field, Taren
Ferry, Deven Ride and Watch Hill, lies to the far west. Technically
considered part of Andor, the Two Rivers has not seen a tax collector
or Queen's Guard in seven generations, and few of its residents
consider themselves Andoran.

Baerlon's population swells seasonally when miners and smelters come
down from their shanty towns in the Mountains of Mist.  Whitebridge and
Four Kings both make the majority of their income from merchants and 
traders, as both are on major thoroughfares. Whitebridge has the only 
bridge crossing the Arinelle south of Maradon in Saldaea.
~

page5~
Metals mined in the Mountains of Mist are Andor's most important
products, though tabac and wool are also important industries. The
vast majority of Andorans consider such things as Trollocs and Fades
to be nothing more than fantastic legends. People outside of Andor
believe that horrific creatures wander the Mountains of Mist.

The Inner City and the palace of Caemlyn were built by Ogier, though
the city has expanded outside the original walls, an area called the
New City.

Andoran men wear trousers, shirts and coats, the women wear long
dresses, and both wear cloaks in cold weather. Class distinctions are
displayed through differences in the quality of cut and cloth. Most of
the smaller villages have a way of distinguishing a mature woman, such
as a braid or a bonnet.

The Andoran Queens are among the few rulers to openly admit to keeping
Aes Sedai advisors. It is traditional for the Daughter-Heir to train
with the Aes Sedai, and her brother to train with the Warders, at Tar
Valon. Not all Andorans approve of these associations and traditions.

Most Andorans are dark-haired and dark-eyed people of medium height
with a medium skin tone. Blondes and light-eyed people are rare,
though the Andoran nobility is known for its red hair and blue eyes.
~
E
page2~
Queens have ruled Andor for centuries. The Queen's brother is Prince
Regent and Captain-General of her armies. A Governor of the Queen
administrates the larger towns. Villages are governed by a Mayor and a
Village Council, and a Wisdom and a Women's Circle. The Queen's Guard
keeps the peace in Caemlyn and throughout the countryside and larger
towns are walled and patrolled by a Town Watch.

                            THE NATION OF ANDOR

Andor lies in the center of the known world, bounded on the west by
the Mountains of Mist, on the east by Cairhien, on the south by
Ghealdan and Murandy, and on the north by wilderness. A class system
exists in Andor, with the nobility dominant, but all citizens are
treated fairly by that nobility.

seduction, even categorizing types of kisses and touches.

The nobility wear bracelets marked with the symbols of their Houses. A
fair number of Domani are merchants, trading in fur and timber. The
Domani eat with red-lacquered chopsticks called sursa. Food dishes are
vegetables and meats in sharp, sweet sauces. Bandar Eban is well-known
for its fine library.

The women wear clinging dresses made of thin cloth, tied with a narrow

the north.  The Arafellin have strange ideas about honour and death.
At least some Arafellin are pale-skinned with dark eyes.  The Arafellin

Cairhien was once the only nation esteemed by the Aiel, who gave the
Cairhienin Avendoraldera, a sapling of the Tree of Life, over four
hundred years ago. Then twenty years ago, King Laman chopped it down
to build a throne, starting the Aiel War. The War ravaged Cairhien,

The Cairhien are a very short people, with dark hair and dark eyes.  The
upper classes wear dark clothing marked with coloured stripes on the chest
to denote rank. Noblemen wear bell-shaped or flat velvet caps, noblewomen
wear their hair piled high, and skirts several feet wide. Both wear pale
lacy ruffles at their cuffs. In contrast, many of the lower classes dress
as flamboyantly as Tinkers. Respectable members of the middle class usually

Daes Dae'mar, the Game of Houses, is a national obsession. The
nobility jockey constantly for power and position, using commoners as
pawns or assassins. The commoners seek any information that might be
sold to the nobility. While the Game of Houses is played among the
nobility of almost all southern nations, it is taken to extremes in
Cairhien.
~
E
page2~
Cairhien's culture is sharply divided along class lines. The upper
classes care little about the lower. Cairhienin display a formal
facade, though members of the lower classes are much more relaxed with
each other. The Noble Houses vie amongst each other for power, and the
country's ruler is the head of the most powerful House, whether male
or female.
~
E
page1~
                          THE NATION OF CAIRHIEN

The Spine of the World mountain range forms Cairhien's eastern border,
and the nation is equidistant between the northern and southern
portions of the continent. The mountains of Kinslayer's Dagger border
Cairhien to the north.

Much of the country is hilly land, and the Cairhien terrace those
hills for building and farming purposes. Many noble houses support
vineyards on their terraced estates. The village Tremonsien grows
barley and oats.

Aes Sedai are feared and despised by most in Illian, and few will
handle Tar Valon marks, though there is no law against trading with
Aes Sedai. Some women Illianers think that Aes Sedai aren't so bad as
rumoured.
~
E
page4~
Illian is famed as the sponsor of the Hunt for the Horn of Valere. The
Hunt was last called four hundred years ago, and is still a popular
subject of song and story. Before the Hunt begins, the Hunters gather
in the city of Illian for the Blessing, as well as days of festivals.
A more frequent festival is the annual Feast of Teven. Contests and
prizes for gleemen are part of the celebration.
~
E
page3~
Common men often sport beards that leave their upper lips bear, and
the women wear wide hats tied under the chin with colourful scarves.
Fishing and shipping are common occupations along Illian's extensive
coastline. It is traditional for business people to share profits with
employees as a work incentive. As in many hot countries, life moves at
a slower pace than to the north.
~
E
page2~
Illian's government is complex. It is ruled by a King, the Council of
Nine (Nobles) and the Assemblage (commoners). The politicians are so
busy squabbling amongst themselves that they rarely interfere with the
daily lives of citizens.

Illian lies on the Sea of Storms. Altara borders it on the west, and
Murandy to the north. The Plains of Maredo separate Illian from Tear
to the east. The two have a tense relationship that occasionally
erupts into armed conflict. The climate is hot and damp, and rains are
heavy in the "cooler" season. The capital city is built on a marsh,
and has as many canals as it does streets.

Traditional titles for the king included Lord of the Seven Towers, and
Lord of the Lakes, a reference to Malkier's fabled thousand lakes.
Each of its kings and queens took an oath to fight against the Shadow,

without issue, the Great Lords of the land cast rods upon the Crowning
Stone to select the new king.

Prior to its destruction, it was a noble land battling to keep the
forces of the Dark at bay. Jealousy and strife in the royal family led
to a weakening of its armies, and Malkier was unable to defend itself
from the Trolloc hordes that took advantage of this weakness. The
survivors of the invasion fled south, most taking up residence in
other Borderlands, and Malkier fell to the Blight.

Tear has been seeking to annex Mayene for many centuries, but the
state defends itself by playing Daes Dae'mar. Despite the support of

competes with Tear's olive oil exports.

Murandy does not think of itself as a nation. Citizens' primary

The chair is black, perhaps carved from black wood, but more likely varnished
