From ghealdan:

WHO ARE THESE CLOAKED FANATICS?

Garbed in simple dress, often tattered but always of a dark hew,
rumors from Ghealdan claim that a band of fanatics have formed,
led by a powerful Borderlander named Masema. Their so called
Prophet. Fanatically clinging to the Light, so tightly that
cities burn in the wake of this uncouth rabble, they are to be
feared by every nation for their numbers are large and their
chaos unquestioned. Ghealdan is only held together by the tenuous
and unseasoned rulership of Queen Alliandre, who through some
miracle, has managed to make some sort of agreement with Profit
Masema to allow her country to exist. 
Smoke curls up from the burned and ravaged homes left behind as
the Dragonsworn sweep through the countryside, taking what they
wish and leaving little. No man is favored higher than any other
and all wealth is shared and collected for the betterment of the
whole. Yet, they are a threat, a powerful, chaotic force that
moves west from Ghealdan, slowly approaching Andor, the fields of
Ghealdan, torn and destroyed by the footsteps of thousands of
vagabonds.
The whisper spreads. The chain of command sings with
information. The Profit, who often was seen with froth foaming at
his mouth and holding that look in his eyes, the look of a
madman, has disappeared. Is he dead? Has the insanity of the
Dragonsworn ended? Or has simply another more power-hungry man
taken control of this uncertain and formidable group? We know the
name of their new leader but nothing else, the Prophetess
Kindrana.

From Amador...

THE TRUE LIGHT. WHO IS OUR LEADER?

The streets are unquiet of late. Arrests are on the rise, men
with one hand are not uncommon and who else makes the arrests but
our fair and just children of the Light. The true defenders of
the Light seem to be also unquiet, judging from the irritable and
worried officers, some paling visibly when certain men, powerful
men, walk or ride through the streets. Word moves slowly but it
does move from the palace and from the Dome of Truth, word of a
new beginning, a new focus, a new forward and aggressive policy.
The old and wise soldier Lord Pedron Niall is laid to rest, slain
by an assassin's knife, the traitor Lord Abdel Omerna in turn
slain by the hand of Lord Captain Eamon Valda. Details for the
people, beyond this basic knowledge, is scarce, save that Lord
Captain Eamon Valda was confirmed as Lord Captain Commander of
the Children of the Light by the Council of the anointed. 
Lord Eamon is the author of this new, bold policy, a policy
that has caused the hunt for the Witches to be even more
vigorous.
One last matter of note from this troubled nation centers
around the royalty of the country. There appears to be a very
important and favored guest who has the run of the palace and the
ear of the King. The identity of this guest has not been
confirmed by this writer or anyone reliable yet it appears to be
a woman and a powerful one at that, a woman of unusual beauty and
presence.

THE BLACK-COATS. WHO ARE THEY?

They are known as the Asha'man, defenders in the Old tongue,
the language used long ago before Kinslayer broke the world.
Almost nothing is known of this band of mysterious and dangerous
men, yet there are a few notes that do explain one or two things
about them. The amnesty, a declaration by the Lord Dragon, Rand
al'Thor, currently is enforced in our fair country of Andor, its
purpose, to allow male Channelers sanctuary and learning at a
place that is unknown to this writer and any other outside this
infamous group. Many have been seen walking the streets, some
wearing distinctive pins on their collar, one of a small silver
sword, the other of a gold dragon, their significance not known.
Some wear both pins, some just the silver sword, which speaks of
ranks, yet what rank distinction could be made by a single pin? 
Their leader appears to be Rand al'Thor yet, he does not wear
the pins nor the coat. Who has the ability, the skill, to control
these dangerous weapons? Can they resist the Taint long enough to
perform their duty, whatever that may be? Are they the servants
of the Lord Dragon, or do they perform their own private,
sinister tasks in the name of the dark or some other power? Who
knows the truth? Who can we believe? Where can we go for an
explanation?
Keep close to one another and be wary my friends. Menace and
mystery hovers about these men like a second high-collared coat
and whether they should be trusted is far from certain.

From Andor

ANDORAN ROYALTY. WHO WILL LEAD US NOW?

Frighteningly and mysteriously, not only the Trakand women have
disappeared. Lord Gareth Bryne has also been ordered to his
estates and runs his small township with his characteristic iron
fist.
Lord Brelon Taravin is the Captain General of the Queen's Guards
in Lord Gareth's place, a powerful, aged soldier who appears to
control the Queen's Guards with more steel than his predecessor. 
In the place of good Queen Morgase, High Seat Dyelin Taravin has
been named, by all the powerful houses in our fair realm, Regent
of Andor, until Elayne Trakand or her mother, Morgase Trakand
appear to take up the sacred and honored rose crown and sit upon
the Lion Throne. Her wisdom is widely known and respected as is
her strong and commanding air. Support for her is strong and
fills the void left by our strangely vanished Queen.
Lord Kier, High Seat of house Caeren has been named High
Justicar of Andor and head Magistrate of the realm. Powerful and
swift in action, this well-established and honored nobleman has
Andor's courts running smoothly and justly.
Yet, above all this, the black-coated ones walk our streets,
The Children of the Light confront the Queen's Guards, other
unnamed bands, dressed in dark, concealing cloaks, claim to
follow the Light and Rand al'Thor and also battle the Children
and the Queen's Guards. With so many powerful figures in
positions of power, it shows our country to be far from weak, but
can we not find peace? Can a man or woman or child walk the
streets of our fair capital with impunity and without fear of
being harassed or harmed by a fool  or group of fools? I say they
cannot and what this means for Andor and the future to come, is
an uncertain and perilous thing.

From Andor:

ANDOR. WHAT HAS BECOME OF US?

Morgase, by the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Protector
of the Realm, Defender of the People, High Seat of the House
Trakand, where has she gone? It has been days since any has seen
her likeness. Is she dead or merely missing? Are we to then bow
down to this Lord Gaebril and call him king as we have never done
before? I say nay. I say the Lord Gaebril should not be our first
King, but that the tradition of the queens be kept, for our
nation to be led by the ancient blood of Ishara, first Queen of
our fair realm.
But even as we speak of Lord Gaebril, Aiel, tall, tanned,
black-veiled warriors from beyond the Spine of the World, invade
our nation and how they managed to enter the city is unknown.
What is known and felt are the hordes of Trollocs and Fades that
burst from the palace, Queen's Guards and Aiel fighting side by
side to slay the shadowspawn, bound together in purpose against a
common enemy. Bodies riddle the streets, the forces of the Dark
One slain and banished yet not quick enough to avoid harm to the
commons. Lord Gaebril, the man who we almost knelt to in our time
of need, is proclaimed to be Rahvin, one of the Forsaken by Rand
al'Thor. Can it be possible that Lord Gaebril, one of our most
respected, if most ambitious lords, is one of those Chosen
thirteen who helped Kinslayer shatter our world and end the Age
of Legends? It is a thought that troubles the mind and puts fear
into the hearts of even the most strong-willed, yet the man is
dead, killed, burned from the Pattern by the Lord Dragon. Yet,
now his Aiel patrol the streets with Saldaean cavalry, assisting
the Queen's Guard in their traditional duties. Is this right?
Should we allow such foreign powers even this measure of
influence in our own nation?

From Cairhien:

WHO CAN SAVE US?

The black-veiled ones, the giants, Savages of the untamed
Waste, spear-wielding orchestrators of death, they have invaded,
burned, pillaged, raped, murdered, destroyed, everything we hold
dear. The cities surrounding the pearl of the nation, Cairhien
herself, are awash in blood-thirsty killers with hidden faces,
even women with stabbing spears and  eyes that plainly speak of
ice, cold, oblivion, run amok amongst our defenceless and
unprepared townsfolk. Even sport is made of the helpless, as some
of the Savages round up a group of men, huddle them together like
cattle and proceed to riddle them full of arrows, taking pleasure
in allowing a few a brief moment of hope as they flee and then
effortlessly striking them down with a well-placed shaft of wood
to the back of a knee or shoulder, aimed to inflict pain and
worse.
We are beleaguered, hemmed in, unable to escape this flood of
nightmare unless, there is something upon the horizon, more
glinting spears, more veiled ones, are they come to defend us or
slay us. They come from the east, they come from the Waste, light
help us and the Creator shelter us in his hand for our doom
appears to be sealed.

From Cairhien:

THE LORD DRAGON. SALVATION OR DAMNATION?

Fires. The tongues of flame envelope the Foregate as if we were
standing next to the sun that is so far away. Red gouts of fiery
obliteration, consume homes, shops, streets, alleys,, a massive
firestorm of annihilation that cascades throughout the outer
city, leaving in its wake, burned, chard, skeletons of former
humans, animals, birds, anything caught in this hellish inferno
of doom. 
The grasslands, the beautiful fields that surround our capital,
are washed in blood, soaked in death as the final madness takes
hold. Black-veiled figure fights black-veiled figure in a dance
of death. Lightning strikes from the sky, fireballs envelope and
destroy hilltops, rain pours down in sheets of endless, drowning
water as if the Creator was trying to wash the ground clean of
horror.
Death. Death all around us, the spears clashing, the horses
rearing, the men dying, the banners, a sinewy serpent, showing
golden in the maelstrom of natural forces, roaring its defiance
and showing its strength.
The fighting calms, the seas of destruction retreat, leaving
behind a ruined Foregate and a fleeing army, but which army? Who
was defeated. More importantly, who are our new Masters? Who has
come to enslave us and will they torture us like our last
Taskmasters?
A man rides into the city, surrounded by the Savages but this
time entirely encircled by women. A woman in skirts, her flaming
hair and hawk-like green eyes peering around intently, clings to
the man's back as if he were her savior. Tasselled spear in hand,
golden dragon buckle upholding his swordbelt, is this the one of
who we have heard stories? Is this the young man who drew
Callandor from the Heart of the Stone in Tear? Does the Creator
loathe us so much that he brings the very man destined to Break
the world again, shatter it into a thousand pieces as Kinslayer
did so long ago, into our fair city? What will he do? Who will he

kill? Does he know of what he speaks? Will his Savages keep the
peace or is this a thin veneer of civility placed atop the horror
that lays inside?
Answers. The people need to know, for our souls, for our
sanity. We pray, we hope, he will bring us salvation. The Light
shine upon us, we will need its protection in the coming storm.

From Cairhien:

THE SINNER KING COMES.

Rand al'Thor, we know his name now, suddenly disappears in a
flash of light in the courtyard of the Sun Palace. How is this
possible? Is it one of his channeling tricks? Does the Taint hold
him enthrawled or does his mind still work for the Light. Pray
that it be so.
We hear the Lord Dragon is the ruler of Andor, meaning he must
have humbled Queen Morgase, something this writer must doubt, for
the queen, all be she smothered in self-interest, is a powerful
and worthy adversary for our nation of Cairhien. 
But what of this new King? Justarius Dal'ken, coming to power
in Damodred. He appeared to be a powerful man, a Light follower,
a King that only comes once in generations. He settled the fears
and hearts of the public. He walked with presence  and spoke with
skill, calming the uneasy minds of the citizenry and yet, what it
all a sham? Was it all a trick, a hokes? A mirage? An illusion of
grandeur where only filth, destruction and horror stood. 
Andor, ever imperialistically inclined, has declared war upon
us. What are we to do? To whom do we turn in our hour of need?
for the memories, the horrors of the Savages still linger in the
thoughts of the commons. Will the Andorans crush us? will King
Justarius Dal'ken Damodred save us? Who has the power? who has
the strength, the fortitude to face another large-scale conflict?

ANDOR STRIKES IN OUR HOUR OF REBUILDING.

War rages, death once again envelops us in its inky midnight
cloak of endless night. The war is fair, battles won and lost and
yet, what of the lightning strikes, firestorms, groundquakes that
spew rock, dirt, grime, destruction into the midst of the Andoran
forces? Who hath the power to command such elemental might?
surely it is not the Lord Dragon for he is the ruler of Andor is
he not? Is it our King? Is it King Justarius, the sworn defender
of our nation and our seeming savior? Still, he may wield this
uncertain power in our defence and the defence of our blessed
country if he be not taken by filth and Taint and touch of he who
is banished in shayol Ghul.
The Andorans advance, winning battle after battle, despite the
seemingly inexhaustible strength of our fair and just King. 
Fires once again envelop the countryside, killing many,
destroying crops and worse in its wake. Cairhien, the jewel of
our nation is now imperiled by the advancing host of Andorans.
Justarius, good King Justarius, he is the only one we might turn
to, our only advantage in this time of need. But what is this?
What are these beasts, these eyeless things that now crawl
through the streets? They are shadowspawn, Trollocs, Halfman!
What cruel wisdom. What filth. What horror. What betrayal. King
Justarius, he has sworn himself into eternal darkness. He has
given us up into the hands of his new and terrible master. He has
called his true servants, his twisted nightmarish creatures of
doom to plunder our city, kill our people, rape our womenfolk
once again as once did the Savages. 
Now the city is in flames and ruin. Buildings, shattered by
storms of the One Power, jagged bolts of effervescent lightning,
endless storms of obliterating fire, ragged chunks of the very
stone beneath our feet, rises to smash down the mighty topless
towers, to bring low what once was so grand and graceful. 
Black coats fill the streets, the sun Palace seems to be the
center of attention. The fighting calms, the horror ends, the
waiting and repairing begins. The King is dead, his servants
banished back to their dark tombs. Yet, is this what the
attention of the Lord Dragon brings? Is he our true savior? Who
will bring us back from the edge of destruction this time? Who
will help us put back together the tattered shards of a broken
kingdom.

From Cairhien:

THE REGENCY. IS SHE BETTER THAN HER FATHER?

The Lady Zerani Dal'ken Damodred. Who is she? Can she be
trusted or is she but another pawn, another piece that comprises
the court of the sun? Her father, the scum Justarius, proved to
be a traitor. Does not the blood of traitors flow into their
offspring? perhaps so, yet perhaps not. Rand al'Thor, making
another move in the Game, has placed this oddest of women as
Regent of Cairhien and ruler until the Daughter-heir Elayne
trakand, daughter of Morgase Trakand and Queen of Andor, is able
to assume the throne. Lady Zerani appears to have been a
guardswoman in the late Justarius' personal guard, which would
make her a formidable warrior. Does she have the skill to rule a
broken country and put back together, what was once so fair? Only
time will tell whether she has the political skills to stay above
the ever-present and often tumultuous goings on of Daes Daemar.
It is also whispered, in various corners that she has taken an
Aes Sedai advisor, one highly placed in the White tower. No
substantiality has been made to the claim, yet, if she has done
so, she cannot be sworn to the darkness lest she have power to
rule an Aes Sedai and that does not exist in the opinion of this
Writer.

From Altara:

ALTARA. TRUTH OR MIRAGE

Deep within the jungle-like forests and war-ravaged, decrepid
cities of Altara, lies the center of the long ago Whitecloak War,
Salidar. Up until a few months ago, the city was empty, devoid of
any human life, yet now curls of smoke swirl up into the sky as
the ring of the hammer and glowing fires of the forges, speak of
recent habitation. Shadowed and mysterious forms move through the
forests surrounding the township, like wisps of insubstantial
darkness, scouting the area and preventing any from entering the
town limits. Yet, even though one may not enter, much can be
heard and gathered from simple gestures and observations. A large
Band of warriors, half cavalry, half infantry, is located around
the stronghold, some wearing red bands on their arms, signifying 
some sort of obscure rank. Their leader, a relatively tall man
who moves with the grace of a cat and whose gaze sometimes seems
ancient, as if he knows of events of the past, can be spotted by

the respect and acknowledgement the others of his band show him.
Although adhoring the bowing and saluting, he seems to know
exactly how to run an army. 
Other soldiers, these wearing few distinctive markings are led
by a tall, weather-worn man with a broad, blunt face and eyes
nearly as experienced as the younger leader of the other group.
His identity is unknown, yet many seem to recognize him, simply
not place him. 
Little else is worth reporting save two events that occurred a
a moon or two ago. The first was seen by this writer's own eyes,
winged beasts floating out of the sky, men and women on their
backs, leaping off to engage whoever they can find on the ground.
Strange cries fill the air, emerging from the throats of
unrecognizable beasts never seen before. Who are these fearsome
invaders? From where have they come? They fight like demons,
steel glinting as it hacks through flesh and bone and muscle,
tearing the life violently from many before subdued in their own

right. An insect-like helmet is torn from the head of one such
downed soldier, his fixed, staring eyes, peering sightlessly up
at the overcast sky above.
Sitting around the fire with a group of soldiers, bits and
pieces of information, rumor and substantiated claims are pieced
together, to fill in a picture of strength, determination,
betrayal and death. A new woman comes to power amongst the Aes
Sedai, a girl, a child, barely seeming to have seen her
eighteenth nameday and yet she wears the seven-striped stole of
the Amyrlin and the other Aes Sedai seem to follow her where ever
she goes, like obedient hounds, though this writer does not seek
to compare an Aes Sedai to a hound. Still, the girl is raised to
a position of prominence. What is to become of this girl? What
does this sequestered group in Salidar seek to do with their new
Amyrlin? Do they seek to challenge the power, prestige and
influence of the White Tower itself? What of the woman she chose
as her right hand, the one who wore the blue stole of the Keeper?
She was caught allowing Myrddraal and worse into the Salidar camp
and was immediately slain for her crimes. Does this make the girl
a Darkfriend as well? Is this a plot of darkness designed to
overthrow the power in Tar Valon? The Creator, may he show us the
way of Light and banish for us all illusions and deceptions, for
there are many and not all of the devising of the Father of
Lies.
