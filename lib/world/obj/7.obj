Rich mahogany forms this canopy bed supported by four posts.  The headboard is
carved as a rising sun and gold-washed, giving it a antique appearance.  The
footboard looks much the same as the headboard.  The four posts rise up carved
as Avendesora trees.  Between the posts are hung wispy blue silk drapes that
offer little privacy.  The bedding is made of soft velvets, over which a few
furs have been thrown.  The royal blue pillows edged in gold have been pushed
aside in favor of a large plain pillow covered in cotton.  The canopy of the
bed is a simple square frame joining the four posts.  The canopy is edged in
embossed rising suns.

a noble's aides, or a Queen's guard, as well as blatant disregard of any other
law listed below that could be foreseen as a threat to Andor. Minor Treason may

chapter 1 one treason~
\c14TREASON \c00is described as an act against the Crown and ruling body, including
those nobles as acting heads of state and advisors to the Crown. Treason is the
highest offense possible under Andoran Law and as such is a case able to be tried
only by the High Justicar or, if she so wishes it, the Queen herself. The trial
must take place in a meeting of the High Seats, who may defend the accused if
they so choose. Punishment if found guilty is public and immediate death. A
pardon may only come from the Queen and in the form of permanent exile.

Acts that may fall under the writ of Treason:
\c08* \c00Coordinator or excessory of an open show of violence on Andoran soil.
     \c09-- \c00See Chapter 5, Special Cases, for exceptions.
\c08* \c00Plotting against the Crown and ruling body.
\c08* \c00Leading an undeclared and unauthorized group of guards numbering over three
  into Caemlyn. Declarations can be made at any guardhouse outside the city gates,
  or a petition may be written to the Court for approval.
     \c09-- \c00The Warders of an Aes Sedai are exempted from this law.

chapter 3 three truancies~
\c14NORMAL TRUANCIES \c00are defined as any illegal act not against nobility or
ranking officials or not declared as treason by one. This type of law makes
up the bulk of all Andoran Law, and is the most common occurence within the
population. Decisions range from minor to severe, and can be made by any available
Magistrate, the more minor by apprentice Magistrates. Decisions may be overturned
once by any higher ranking Magistrate if the appeal is filed no later than two
days after the original trial. The appeal is not of concern to the highest courts
of the High Justicar and a meeting of the High Seats, and so may not be written
thus. The accused may not be tried twice on the same charge, however repeat
offenses may elevate the charge to a Minor Treason. See chapter 5, Special Cases,
for more information.

Acts that may fall under the writ of Normal Truancies:
\c08* \c00Obstruction of justice\c00
\c08* \c00Silent witness, meaning not coming forward with information to a crime.
\c08*\c00 Excessory/partner to any crime, truancy or treason.
\c08*\c00 Disrupting the peace, including
     \c08* \c00Verbal harrassment/threats
     \c08*\c00 Physical harrassment/battery
     \c01* \c00Vandalism
\c01* \c00Theft
\c01*\c00 Murder of a non-noble
\c01*\c00 Rape
     \c09--\c00 The latter two, murder and rape, are very serious truancies, and
        as such require the maximum sentence available.

chapter 4 four nobility~
\c14OFFENSES CONCERNING NOBILITY\c00
Any case surrounding a noble as defendant must be handled in a more
discrete manner since nobility is more important than the average
citizen. As such, a noble is not guilty under the same laws, and may
also petition the Courts for a settlement outside of trial. If there
is a case against a noble by a commoner, the plaintiff must first speak
privately to a Magistrate who will determine if the case is worthy to
be tried.

Any case surrounding a noble as plaintiff must also be handled discretely,
especially if the defendent is another noble. A noble's House is allowed
to handle cases with commoner defendents on its own provided justice
does not get too violently out of hand. If one noble has a case
against another noble, it must either be handled by the High Justicar
or in trial before a council of the High Seats.

In treason cases, a noble is susceptible to the same laws as commoners.
See Chapter 1. Treason for more information.

Acts by commoners that may fall under the writ of individual nobility justice:
\c08* \c00Suspicious loitering on or around House property
\c08* \c00Slander/libel against a noble
\c08* \c00An attack on a noble or any House guard or aide
\c08* \c00A Queen's Guard not defending an Andoran noble
     \c09--\c00 This offense demands the guard be immediately fired, and possibly
        face charges of Treason should the noble wish to file suit.

chapter 5 five special~
\c14SPECIAL CASES\c00

\c08* \c00A partner/excessory to a crime of high Treason may be tried for normal
  truancies if good cooperation is shown. This call is up to the Magistrate.
\c08* \c00Aes Sedai and their Warders are to be shown high respect, exempt from
   many of the Laws of Andor.
\c08* \c14VIOLENT CHANNELING\c00 is against the law within the Queen's City, Caemlyn,
  on penalty of immediate detaining until the proper individuals can be contacted
  to deal with the perpetrator.
     \c09-- \c00See Amendments for more details
\c08* \c14REPEAT OFFENSES\c00 in any crime can result in stiffer penalties. For example,
  a thief found guilty of stealing more than twice shall have a hand cut off.
  These decisions are up to the Magistrate trying the case.

section A alternate ruling~
\c14ALTERNATE RULING \c00(as written by the High Seats)

In the event that the Queen and her direct heirs are unable to rule, an
emergency meeting of the High Seats will be called to vote on a temporary
Regent to the Crown. This Regent will wield the same powers as the Queen save
those of determining new heirs should the Queen fail to return to her duties.

section B amnesty~
\c14THE AMNESTY OF MALE CHANNELERS \c00(as written by Lord Rand al'Thor)
(transcribed for law by the Regent Dyelin Taravin)

Should any male channelers be found in Andor or detained or arrested for
channeling, they will be immediately turned over to a representative of the
Asha'man for proper punishment. Andor is to be considered a sanctuary for any
man who thinks he can channel and wishes to declare himself to the Dragon.
Any molestation of these men should be quickly dealt with by the Queen's
Guards and the courts of Andor.

\c09-- \c00Amended (Regent Dyelin Taravin): Should any man channel violently within
Caemlyn walls and refuse detainment, the guards are within their rights to open
fire and wound or kill him. Should any Asha'man channel violently in Caemlyn
without provocation, the Amnesty may fall under serious reconsideration.

section C aiel~
\c14AIEL CITY PATROL\c00 (as written by Lord Rand al'Thor)
(transcribed for law by High Justicar Kier Dalwen Caeren)

As an army of the Dragon Reborn, the Aiel are completely exempted from regular
Andor Law except in the case of unnecessary violence. The Aiel patrols are to
be acknowledged and respected on the same level as the Queen's Guards so long
as they follow the same policies. Anyone arrested by an Aiel patrol must be
brought to the court jail and the proper reports filed. If this does not occur,
a grievance may be written to Clan Chief Rhuarc or any head of Aiel patrol.

The Clan Chiefs and Wise Ones of the Aiel are to be acknowledged and respected
on the same level as minor nobility. No guards may intervene in their matters,
and they may order an Aiel released from custody should one be arrested for the
single crime of unnecessary violence.

Should this crime of violence be committed, the Aiel is to be detained, not
arrested, and brought to the court jail, a message sent immediately to the Aiel
camp. The Courts of Andor may not try an Aiel for a crime.

section D ogier~
\c14OGIER PRESENCE AND RIGHTS\c00 (scribed 784NE)

The Builders are hereby given full protection under the Queen's Justice for the
duration of their stays in Andor's borders. The Ogier are to be shown respect; they
may not be arrested nor must they stand trial should an accusation arise. In the
case of a detainment, all involved should be brought to a private audience with the
Queen or the High Justicar. Ogier may not be jailed.

All inns within the capital of Caemlyn will have at least one (1) room built to the
parameters of no less than 20ft x 30ft, fitted with an Ogier sized bed. All inns will
offer room and board without question, unless the room be occupied by another Builder.

Any who attack or murder an Ogier will receive double the regular sentence.

The Queen's Guards are to watch out for the well being of an Ogier as they would
a High Lord. Should any Guard be lax in his duties, he will be punished with double the
regular decision.

In accordance with land management, all Steddings, defined as a plot of trees grown
and cultivated by Ogier and a place of shelter and living space, are off-limits from
deforestation and urban expansion.
