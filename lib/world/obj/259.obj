        - (2) Practice Sessions: These practice sessions should entail working 
     on what was taught in the first lesson. It must be supervised and can be

     The lesson has to be supervised or run by any higher ranking guild member.
.

glee~
Gleeman:
Advancement from this level on is done by RP, since you should ICly know
everything there is to know about being a gleeman, and have established 
yourself. Send me RP logs and let me know what you have been up too...
RP with others in the guild and take a few people 'under your wing'. If your
RP skills prove you to be advanced enough you might make the master gleeman
rank after awhile.
~
E
master~
Master Gleeman:
This rank is a teaching rank. If you have gotten this rank, you have completed
all class's and proven your IC worth as a gleeman, and now are a respected member
of the family.
~
E
notes~
Definitions/Elborations:
.
-Lessons should entail the teaching of certain skills and there is a wide 
 range of freedom in what can be taught. The idea is that each lesson will 
 build off the next so it's best if you let the mentor know what you have 
 already been taught and what you are inching toward next.
.
-Practice sessions can entail one of two things. They can be a session in 
 which a higher ranking member of the guild watches you practice a previously 
 learned lesson and gives you pointers or it can be a performance witnessed 
 by a higher ranked guild member in the skill you had the lesson in. The only 
 exception is journeymen who do not have practice sessions and are required 
 to do performances to satisfy the requirement.
.
-Only journeyman lessons have to be taught by a gleeman whose personal focus 
 matches the one you're getting the lesson in. The lower rank lessons can be 
 taught by anyone though may be limitations. (If I oocly and icly have no clue 
 how to play a harp and I can't even imagine how to fake it, then it's unlikely 
 I could RP teaching someone how to)
.
-Only the first student primary lesson has to be taught by your own personal 
 mentor though it's a good idea to get as many lessons from that person as 
 possible. It establishes a more realistic Rp experience as well as strengthens 
 IC bonds.
.
-Please mail the GL's any lessons you have received OR given. We'd like to get
 mails from the student as well as the teacher. Also, if you observe any 
 performances, or if you claim someone has seen you perform, please have them
 email the GL's as well. Keeps things clear! :)
.
One more thing, if you have any suggestions, let me know! I'll put it in
or at least consider it! Thanks a bunch!

Illuminator Lessons -
     (These are mainly the area's of work that you might choose to follow.)
Research
Lesson One - Research Safety
     - The area you work in
        * Be sure there are no flammable materials anywhere
        * When experimenting with small things, a lab is fine, but if it is 
          potential explosive, be sure you are well outside the chapterhouse 
          and any cities.
            -a river nearby is always a plus
            -Have someone watch at a safe distance, so they can help if needed.
     - Equipment
        * Always have your eyes covered with goggles
        * Wear long clothing, to cover all of your skin
        * Wear your hair tied back so it will not get in your way.
 
Lesson Two - The laboratory
     - Ingredients
        * Various types of powders.. do not be afraid to use different types 
          of powders.
        * fuses - don't be afraid to experiment with new types of fuses.
     - Apparatus's
        * Distiller and Purifier - a series of flasks and vials, with a fire 
          burner to purify the powders that you use.
        * Mixing utilities - a series of flasks, using stoppers to trap all of 
          the gases, and tubes to remove these gases.
     
Lesson Three - Types of Research
     - Powders and fuses
         * Powders
            - Find new, more improved ways to use less of a powder, or find new 
              powders and combination of powders that add more to the fireworks.
            - Mainly performed in laboratory, thou when using powders on large 
              scales like nitric powder, you will need to be outside.
 
         * Fuses
            - Ways to use less material, or cheaper material without sacrificing 
              quality
            - all research done in a lab
     - Different Fireworks
          * Illusions
             - Find ways to make new, better illusions.
             - research ways to make them last longer, and be set off faster.
             - usually done both in and out of lab
          * rockets
             - ways to make rockets go higher, and be seen better on even 
               poor days.
             - ways to make one rocket able to do more
          * ground works

Performer

     - Discuss proper safety measure for public shows and proper equipment.
Lesson 2 - Best way to Perform
     - Discuss all of the good features that you might want to make a mainstay 
       in your performances, a certain trick to remind the crowd of who you are.
     - Discuss how to properly line up a show, and also how to attain shows.
&R***&n At least 5 performances for public audiences witnessed but either your 
    mentor, a master Illuminator, or a Fire Master. &R***&n
Enforcer
Lesson 1- 
     - Enforcers are picked by the other enforcers, this is not really a rank 
       you can just choose, you have to be chosen for it.
Lesson 2- 
     - Most lessons and fireworks give by and used by Enforcers are tightly 
       kept secrets that only Enforcers, Master Illuminators, and Fire 
       Masters are privileged to.
Lesson 3 -
     - This will mainly be a lesson on making the special Enforcer fireworks 
       and stuff.
&R***&n Just Do what you think might get you into the rank, you won't know if 
    you make it till you are picked. &R***&n

notes~
Notes:

- All Illuminators will be given a key to the Chapterhouse when accepted. It is
 your responsibility to keep it locked as well as keeping others out. The only
 way they could get in, is through that locked door. So, for RP purposes, people
 -can- get in, if you don't lock the door. ;)

- If you have any comments or suggestions, mail Sehrna and she'll take 
 care of it ASAP.
