fountain women fish~
This fountain is very big, enveloping a large portion of the square. Three
women, completely unclothed, support a stone fish upon their shoulders. The
fish's tail extends just beyond them, tail lashing in the air. Its mouth
has opened wide and long whiskers dangle from its face, giving it a grotesque
expression. The women seem calm enough, and crystal water flows freely from
the fish into the basin of the fountain.

fountain man~
The large fountain rests in the middle of the square, facing south. A
man kneels in its center upon a pedestal, clothed in a simple coat
and breeches. His eyes are intent upon his work as he dips a bucket
into the carved stream beneath him. Water flows from his pail and slides
smoothly down the stone waterfall of the brook into the basin of the
fountain.

fountain woman~
The woman is just under six feet in height, and looks so life-like she
might as well not be stone. Her hands are cupped together as though
the clear water spewing from them was her creation. She looks not to
her hands, but out at the square around her, gaze as though she were
calculating and planning. She stands stoically on a stone pedestal that
dips into the large fountain beneath her, the water free to all.

fountain chora~
The fountain rests in the very center of this court. Wrought of white stone,
it stands brilliantly in the sun. A young man with a patient face stoops in
the middle of the fountain, holding a bucket that pours real water out into
the basin where a delicate, stone sapling sprouts. The water laps quietly
against its trunk, lending an air of tranquility to the area.

avendesora tree life~
The Avendesora towers high above, and despite its state of ruin, a sense of awe
touches all who look at it. It is the only chora tree left, ever since Laman, the
King of Cairhien, cut down the Avendoraldera. It is said that if you sit beneath
the Tree of Life, great wisdom will come to you. Well, the tree certainly has
comfortable looking roots. High above, almost to the top of the tree, a tiny bit of
green contrasts with the blackened bark. Could it be a leaf; a sign of life?
