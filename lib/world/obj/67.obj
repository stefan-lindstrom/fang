corpse~
The burnt and bloody corpse appears to be from a young man. His once blonde hair is
mostly burnt away from his scalp on the right side of his head, which you notice is
visibly caved in from some massive blow. The left side of his face, however, is still
intact and could be used to identify him. Also you notice that his left hand is 
missing two fingers, and his black cloak is oddly burnt as if he were surrounded in
flames and tried in vain to protect himself with the cloak.
