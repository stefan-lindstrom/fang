corpse woman dead~
The corpse really stank.  The woman were probably
young and beautiful when she died, but the corpse is
old and terrisble to look at.  Long blond hair covers
her nakedness and her dead eyes seems to peer at
you trought death.  She seems to hold something in
her hands, never wanting to let it go, even dead.

curved and edged.
