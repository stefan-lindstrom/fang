outcropping stone~
a tall stone outcropping~
A stone outcropping borders the pool here, shooting several rocky towers up towards the ceiling of the cavern. Between its gaps, you can see a faint dull gleam of metal.~

outcropping stone~
The stone is a dark gray color, jutting from the floor upwards
for several paces before trailing off in jagged points. It seems
to be emanating heat, but between the gaps of the rocky towers
you can make out what appears to be a large bronze wall, or
perhaps a door.

E
seal disc~
It looks like a disc of the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai,
the white half symbolizing the females, a symbol which
is now the flame of Tar Valon, and the black half symbolizing
the males, a symbol which has come to be known as the
Dragon's Fang, and taken for evil.

If it is the eighth seal, it is probably made of heartstone.
