fiddle bow~
It is a fiddle of normal shape and size, extremely well made. The
individual pieces of wood of which it is composed seem to be
molded together into one so perfectly that the joints would be
nearly impossible to see were they not the distinct edges of the
fiddle itself. The bow is strung taut with horsehair, causing it to
curve slightly, and both fiddle and bow are lacquered with a
dark finish, giving them both a rustic look.

The glass panes are so dirty, it is difficult to see anything inside, but
you can at least make out the faint outline of a chair. There could
be a figure of a man inside too, but it is very difficult to make out.
Perhaps it is just a hunting trophy, or a door that is ajar.
