sign parchment notice~
Here ye, here ye: \c01
ALL actions within Illian will be considered IC.  If someone is careful,\c03
there is no reason for it to be OOC.  That means, Leveling, Pkilling, \c04
 or simply being here is IC.  I believe this will cause more RP to occur,\c05
as a charecter might be confronted by a guard, or a Magistrate, forcing\c06
you to have a good story.  There are several new mobs here, and a few\c08
new shops as well, so Enjoy.\c00           \c13Lord Brend\c00
