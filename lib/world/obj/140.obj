fountain~
This stunning marble fountain gleams in the sunlight with its radiance. 
The statue is a of a remarkably beautiful Domani woman, clad in the briefest
and clingiest of dresses, her feet bare as she seems to be walking over
an open field.  Upon her shoulder rests a water pitcher, tipped at a 
precarious angle and letting the crystal clear water it contains to spill
forth endlessly.  The woman seems oblivious to this, her eyes seeming to
catch onlookers in a sultry gaze instead.
