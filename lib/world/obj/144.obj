blade katore swept~
The hilt of this sword is bound in leather...  old worn leather, rubbed
smooth by the chafing of a hundread thousand sword strokes.  This is
obviously the owner's preferred weapon.  Its single-edged blade is
slightly longer than normal, and seems almost too delicate for its reach,
the final third of its extent sweeping smoothly backwards.  Obviously
worked in the finest steel, the blade's mirror polish reflects brilliant
rays of light.

its arms is a small but noteworthy collection of swords,
in a variety of weights and lengths...  everything from
a traditional seanchan blade,  with a heavy swept point,
to a straight-edged blade of watered steel.

crystal statue~
The crystal statue is a masterful blending of smooth lines
and powerful angles, representing a highly stylized, and yet
remarkably lifelike falcon,   seemingly caught in the act of
taking flight,  wings poised for a first powerful downstroke.
The angular head and sharp beak jut forward, the claws bunch
upon the suggestion of a sharp rock below, and the eyes seem
to flash with an avian lust for the skies...

E
pedestal wooden~
The pedestal upon which the glasswork rests is of plain
design, but beautiful in its own fasion. Worked in a finely
grained block of cherry, its has been sanded, rubbed smooth,
and polished until the reddish wood almost shines,  lending
the statue which rests on it a further air of refinement.

\c22This s\c23t\c22a\c23t\c22ue is obviously the work of a master artisan,
the fine pale marble seems to glow with its own light,
and the golden \c10c\c03r\c10o\c03w\c10n\c22 and \c10s\c03w\c10o\c03r\c10d\c22 of the triumphant first

statue manages to capture in stone and gold the living
glory of the greatest \c10h\c03e\c10r\c03o\c22 of the Age.
