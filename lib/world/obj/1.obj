1. History of the Ter'angreal

Upon the discovery of a previously unknown ter'angreal in Caemlyn, I, 
Yvonne Heschel, Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah, left the tower immediately to 
study it. Accompanying me were Alein Mosava and Reanne Estar, Aes Sedai of 
the Red and Green Ajahs respectively. From what I have been able to tell, 
the ter'angreal was created by Aes Sedai who visited Caemlyn during its 
construction. The noble for whom it was built remained silent about it, 
however, as it gave him some small advantages that he did not wish to give 
up.
Aparently the ter'angreal allows the user to find the truthful answer to
one question and one question only. Unfortunately the user must first pass
through a series of puzzles. Those who can not solve the ter'angreal's
riddles are forever lost. This happened to one nobleman several hundred
years ago. His son, in anger, chose to conceal the ter'angreal and forget
of its existence. Turning the room in which the ter'angreal is found into
a closet. It has remained forgotten until recently.

2. Before Entering the Ter'angreal

Before you step into the ter'angreal it is important to remember to
look at everything closely. Clues to solving the riddles of the ter'angreal
can be found anywhere and one must never neglect to find the clues.
The ter'angreal itself is a simple arch made of seven, large stones.
The stones themselves are of various colors. Facing the arch, the colors are,
from left to right: green, grey, white, red, yellow, brown and blue.
The red stone is the cap stone, a fact which made Alein Sedai rather
smug. Whether there is some significance to this or if it is merely 
coincidence is unclear.
Upon the capstone is a brass plaque upon which are written the words,
From the rising of the sun, to the going down of the same. Reanne Sedai
speculates that this could mean that the ter'angreal was a gift from
Cairhien, but this, too, is uncomfirmed.

3. Inside the Ter'angreal

I have been made to promise not to tell the secrets of the ter'angreal, 
but despite this there are still some things that I can pass on to the 
reader. The most important of these is the necessity of light. If you can
not see then you can not solve the riddles.
Everything you need in order to solve the problems is there in that 
ter'angreal. Look closely at everything, especially in the Hall of Colors
and you may leave the ter'angreal with more than just your answer.

4. The Results

All three of us Aes Sedai entered the ter'angreal and came out again.
All of us were met by the same strange being and each asked and received
the answer to our questions. We were also sworn never to speak to another
about the secrets of the ter'angreal.
Alein Sedai seems quite pleased by the answer she received, though
she refuses to tell us what she asked or what she was told. Reanne Sedai
was so traumatized by her answer that she has not spoken a word since leaving
the ter'angreal. I can only speculate as to what caused this reaction.
As for myself, my answer is my own and I will not share it. Suffice it
to say that it is a true answer.
