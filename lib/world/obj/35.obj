E
tactics~
This lecture is designed to teach the trainee some of the do's and don't's of combat against groups larger than three.  It should cover things like the proper methods of dealing with archers/crossbowmen (find cover, wait for them to loose, and then charge them before they can reload... or let your Aes Sedai provide cover with the Power, assuming that such is an option).  The idea that in a situation of this nature it is usually better to flee than to fight is also of prime importance.  If you're set on by
ten men armed variously with bows and swords, you are not likely to win the fight.
~
E
bonding~
The bond joins a Warder and his Aes Sedai at the soul.  Through it, the two are able to know each others' physical state, emotional state, and physical location.  If the Warder is wounded,his Aes Sedai can feel it, and the reverse also holds true.  Likewise, if he is killed, she will know.At the death of her Warder, an Aes Sedai suffers choking grief, often for a year or more.  If his Aes Sedai dies, a Warder is eaten apart from the inside by her demise.  His will to live leaves him, and he begins to seek
out that which can kill him.  Often he dies soon after she does in an attempt to avenge her death.
~
E
shadowspawn~
Explain to the student what the various types of KNOWN Shadowspawn are.  Known shadowspawn include Darkhounds, Myrddraal, Trollocs, Draghkar, Grey Men, and Worms.  Of these, most is known about Myddraal, Grey Men, Draghkar, and Trollocs.
*
Trollocs - About ten feet tall, they're a blend of human and animal stock created by the
Forsaken Aginor during the War of the Power.  They're huge, vicious, cowardly, and stupid. There are millions of them in the Blight, and they are organized into a tribal society.  The females are little more than breeding animals.  Trolloc weapons are generally crudely made, usually spears, swords, axes, or clubs.  Bows are not unknown, but they're rarely used.  Some of them tainted, and the wounds they cause are hard for Aes Sedai to Heal.
*
Myrddraal - Also known as Fades, Halfmen, Shadowmen, Fetches, Lurks, and The Eyeless.  They're humanoid, as tall as most Aielmen, and muscular.  They're always male, and they have no eyes.  Despite the lack, they can see like eagles, even in pitch darkness, and they can feel an Aes Sedai's channeling.  They dress in black, articulated armor that gives them a serpentine appearance, and a black cloak that doesn't seem to be touched by the wind.  Their primary weapon is a black steel sword, forged on the slo
es of Thakan'dar.  Wounds from these blades don't heal properly, and without luck or the help of a talented Healer, death is nearly certain.
*
Grey Men - assassins for the Shadow, they were once humans but gave up their souls to the Dark One to gain the power to pass unnoticed by even the most alert guards.  Their appearence is so ordinary that the mind simply doesn't register their presence.
*
Draghkar - Winged creatures of the Shadow, these beasts are also used as assassins at times.  Their large eyes make it possible for them to see very well from a distance, even in the dark, and they are therefore often employed as scouts.  They aren't very intelligent, and aren't fierce fighters.  Their chief method of attack is through the use of a song that entices their victims closer, for a kiss.  A Draghkar's kiss drains first the soul, and then the life, and the few who have been rescued from it woul
 have been better off dead.
~
E
politics~
The lecture covers the most basic of political theory, such as the implications of the Dragon's control over Caemlyn, Cairhien and Tear, the Aiel's relation to wetlanders, and the names of various important personages in the land.  Zerani Damodred is Regent in Cairhien, Dyelin Taravin is Regent in Andor, Calonis Taravin is Captain-General of Andor's armies.  Eamon Valda is the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, Agelmar Jagad is the commander of Shienar's forces, and his King is Easar Jag
d.  More of that sort of thing is desirable.
The lecture can allow for a considerable amount of personal IC interpretation as well, considering that ICly characters might hold differing political values.  
Also cover the following:  
HOSTILES:  Whitecloaks, Dragonsworn, Asha'man, Forsaken, Darkfriends, Amadicians, Seanchan (rumored only), Shaido Aiel, and the Tower.  
FRIENDLY:  Parts of Da'es Daemar (it can depend on many things, from your own IC nationality to current MUD events), Ogier.  
NEUTRAL:  Band of the Red Hand, parts of Da'es Daemar, Aiel (non-Shaido, though even these are not likely to be your bosom companions), Seafolk (again, it's unlikely that you'll be pals with them, looking at what ends up happening in the books).
~
E
tracking~
The lecture should cover such things as looking for the easiest way through an area, because in many cases the quarry will seek that path, as well as looking for signs of passage.  Teach about looking for fresh horseapples to see how far ahead someone is, or the ashes of recent campfires.  Explain how to follow trampled underbrush in forest areas.
~
E
horseman~
Teach how to tighten a girth strap on the saddle to keep the saddle firmly in place.  Teach about how to mount with a stirrup, and how to guide the horse at a walk.  Explain that a firm hand on the reins is helpful, but that too rough a touch hurts the horse and makes it intractable.  Teach the student about the various gaits - walk, trot (for this, you'll have to teach him to post over the bumps), canter, and gallop.
Essentially, the idea is to get the student able to saddle, bridle, and mount a horse, and to stay on top of it while it's moving.
~
E
survival~
Cover things like looking for certain types of mushroom, or tickling fish out of a stream, or perhaps how to make rabbit snares.  Teach about finding things like dandelion greens, fiddlehead ferns, and edible berries like wild strawberries, blackberries, and gooseberries.  Explain how rotting logs can be broken apart for grubs, in extreme need... and use your imagination.  Possible sources are books/websites about survivalism and/or primitive camping.
~
E
stealth~
Stealth is defined for the purposes of this lecture as the capability to avoid being noticed.  Stealth is desirable to any Warder, and can take any of several forms.  The most basic of them should be covered here.  Clothing choice, use of the wind, shadows, and terrain or vegetation are all elements in the struggle for stealth.  Fibers such as wool are the quietest, while linen and silk rustle.  The wind can carry your scent, if you have something on you that smells.  Shadows can conceal you, but your sil
ouette on a hilltop can betray you.  Again, this lecture is a good place to be creative.  
~
E
surprise~
The lecture should cover the tactical uses of surprise.  Attacking from hiding, throwing dirt, rear attacks, and other such underhanded methods of combat are excellent fodder for the lesson, which should be taught in a free-formed manner.  This lesson is a good opportunity for the instructor to be creative.
~
E
creed~
The Creed
&yOld Tongue:&n
Mia sora inde far mai, mia moridin inde far mai
Aeth misain ye, manshima misain ye, valdar misain ye.
Cue cuebiyari, souvraya ti sovya, sora ti sora -
Inde'ayende e inde caballien, hei jenn, hei far samsagain.
&yCommon:&n
My life given before hers, my death given before hers
I am her shield, her sword, her protector.
Heart to heart, soul to soul, life to life -
Bonded, forever loyal, until the breaking of the Wheel.
*
Purpose
A warder's sole desire, his sole purpose for living, is to protect his Aes Sedai from physical harm.  He does what she says, when she says it, and without public argument.  He goes where she goes, because that's the point of his existence.  He has no honor, save to protect her life - NOT her honor, NOT her emotions - her life.  If she dies, he has failed.  He doesn't fight duels over insults, or argue ethics.  If someone attacks her, he does everything he can to keep her from being killed.  When no one is
attacking, he does everything in his power to keep people from attacking.  He does not attack others, unless there is a direct threat to his Aes Sedai's life from the person he is attacking.
~
E
flameandvoid~
The instructors should know how to do this one.  If not, see the GL to learn it.  Notes:  First off, the student should under no circumstances get this on the first try, or the second or third, (or maybe even the fourth).  It takes TIME to learn this.  Secondly, the Void does -not- make you able to ignore debilitating wounds.  If someone inflicts a wound that disables the function of a muscle or joint, or breaks a bone, then you most assuredly DO suffer the effects of the injury.
~
E
basicsword_3~
Cut - inflicted with the edge of the sword, optimally using the first six inches of the standard curved blade used by trained swordsmen to leave a wound six inches long by approximately four inches deep... should be aimed at soft tissues like muscles and tendons, or across major blood vessels
*
Thrust - Inflicted with the tip or point of the blade, also optimally using the first six inches of the standard weapon... should be aimed for vital organs or for major blood vessels
*
Parry - This is the use of the sword to turn aside or stop an attack aimed to hit your body.  It's best used against a thrust, because a thrust is easier to misdirect than a slash.
*
Dodge - This is the outright avoidance of being in the path of an incoming attack.  It's best used against a slashing attack, if it must be used.
~
E
basicsword_2~
Stance:  Hold your sword point upward, gripped in both hands with your right hand closest to the handguard or crosspiece, and the tip of the blade pointed slightly outward towards your opponent's neck.  Your weight should be balanced evenly on the balls of your feet, and your left foot should be slightly ahead of you.  Your back should be straight, and your arms tucked in close to your body.
*
Balance:  FORM LESSON ONE:
Heron Wading in The Rushes [balance training/attack]:  Rise up to stand balanced on the ball of your left foot, with your right leg lifted so that your knee is up on a level with your chest and your pointed right toes are brushing the top of your left thigh.  Lift your sword above your head, holding it so that its tip is pointed ahead of you, parallel to the ground.  Place your left hand near the handguard, and place your right hand on the pommel of the swordhilt for leverage.  The attack comes when you s
ep forward with your right foot and make a stabbing attack at your imagined opponent's chest, using your sword like the bill of a huge bird of prey.
~
E
basicsword_1~
Unsheathing - how to draw a sword without cutting yourself - Stand straight, and grip your scabbard with your left hand while grasping the hilt of your sword with your right.  Draw smoothly, in one motion, and keep your fingers clear of the blade.  Draw away from your body so that the sword doesn't cut your ribs.  Adlib practice situations such as drawing the blade while lying down, or while sitting, so that the student can practice.
*
Sheathing - how to put up your sword without stabbing yourself in the hip - stand still, with good posture, and place your left thumb lightly against the flat of your swordblade, perhaps one inch from the tip of your blade.  Use your left hand to steady the blade on the way into its scabbard, and when it is on its way in, remove your fingers from the edge of the blade to avoid being cut.  Drills in sheathing while lying down, sitting, etc are encouraged.
*
Basic Terminology - naming the parts of a sword - teach the meaning of such things as pommel,  handguard, quillion, grip, hilt, crossguard, blade, flat, edge, back, tip, and point of the sword.  Explain the differences between them.  Quillions are the protrustions found on what in RL would be considered a cross-shaped sword.  Two of them make up the crosspiece.  A handguard is theround grip found on a katana (actually, it's some other Japanese word, of course, but handguardworks for those of us who aren't
Japanese or kenjitsu students, and it's more Wheel of Time-ish tosay handguard instead of some Japanese word).  The pommel is the end of the handgrip that isnot attatched to the sword.  The handgrip is the part you hold, etc.

conduct~
&RConduct&n
The trainee should be instructed as to the proper behavior towards Aes Sedai, Gaidin, novices, and Accepted, as follows:
Aes Sedai are to be addressed with respect at all times.  Unfamiliar Aes Sedai may be addressed as "Aes Sedai".  If you are introduced to an Aes Sedai, address her by her name, followed with "Aes Sedai".  If and Aes Sedai gives you permission to be less formal, you may address her by her her name followed by "Sedai".
If you meet an unfamilar warder, you may address him simply as Gaidin until such time as his name is known to you, at which point you may address him by his name, followed by "Gaidin".  Trainees are expected to comport themselves as gentlemen in the presence of the novices and Accepted of the Little Tower.  They are to refrain from entering the novice quarters without Aes Sedai escort under any circumstances short of a wartime emergency.  They are not to be present in the Accepted quarters later than dusk.

your guild equipment through the destroy armor spell or by any
other means, you may purchase it here for 1 coin.
The equipment destroys if one not of the guild uses it or if you
are not of the rank it also destroys itself. Please \c08BEWARE\c00
if I find out anyone has abused this shop by obtaining multiple copies
of equipment and handing it out to friends or anyone that should not have
it the punishment will be severe!
Thank you and Enjoy!

Balinor.
