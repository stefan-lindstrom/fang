however; in others, I pray that I am right.  Drawing on logic to conclude

hinge or mortar; something that seems far more likely.  As the seals weaken,
so does the hinge, or the mortar, slowly rusting, or crumbling.
        Given this, it seems likely that other focal points could be made to
replace the rusting hinge, the crumbling mortar.  But do the current seals 
need to be destroyed entirely before this can happen?  I hope it is not so.
        Now that I have answered the questions I set out to answer, or at
~
E
page24~
        Taking into account what we already know of the seals, that they are
focal points on the Dark One's prison, I have to logically conclude that the
seals themselves are NOT his prison.  If the seals themselves were the Dark  
One's prison, it would seem probable that with the destruction of one, a way
would be open to the Dark One to destroy the rest of the prison.  This means 
that something else is his prison, and that the seals act similarly to a 
~
E
page23~
view.  How do the seals do what they do?  How do the seals maintain a closure
to the Dark One's prison?  Do they work similar to mortar between stones?  Or
do they work as a clasp on a gate?  Do the seals focus on the prison as some
kind of impervious sphere, a sphere which is the Dark One's prison?  All of
these questions remain largely unanswered.  However, I will try to answer 
them now, with my own theories.
~
E
page22~
But, then, tied off flows perhaps could have been used, as they were to
guard Callandor all these years.  Though, of course, a Warding and an object
drawing on the Power are entirely different.
        Now, turning the direction of discussion to that of how the seals
work.  I have already discussed the nature of how the seals work, which is
similar to how the seals work, but, not entirely the same in my point of
~
E
page21~
        Consider this picture:  A man who channels eventually goes mad with
the taint, and suffers from a rotting sickness.  If, indeed, the seals draw
on Saidin to operate, could they not also suffer from a rotting sickness,
thereby causing them to weaken?  I think this is quite probable.  However, 
since it is unknown whether or not such a thing can be set up (an object
constantly drawing on the Power to operate), I must wonder if it is possible.
~
E
page20~
why the seals are weakening.  Point 5 above tells us that the seals were
placed by men only, which means Saidin was used.  Saidin which is tainted by
the Dark One's touch.  Saidin, which may provide the strength of the seals; 
and conversely, the taint of the Dark One.  If this is the case, then as time
goes by, with the seals drawing on the One Power to operate, they are also
suffering from a build up of the taint, just as a man who channels does.
~
E
page19~
        This theory also draws on the information cited by many authors that 
the Forsaken were sealed after the Dark One was, sealed closer to the real 
world, and thereby the ever weakening seals.
        Another theory as to the nature of how the seals work is the belief
that the seals somehow draw on the One Power.  Entertaining this notion, I
can theorise that the taint on Saidin plays a large part into the reason of
~
E
page18~
that the Dark One has managed to use the non-evil (I hesitate to use 'good')
parts of the Forsaken as a buffer to the seals.  This answers the question of
both the nature of the seals - drawing on the evil of the Dark One to
maintain their purpose - and the question of why they are weakening - because
the Dark One perhaps has somehow managed to 'starve' the seals of the evil
that keeps them continueing their purpose.  
~
E
page17~
perhaps the seals must draw on the evil that is the Dark One, and also his
minions, the Forsaken.  But then, why are the seals weakening?  
        I propose the belief that the Dark One is pure evil, the essence of 
evil.  Also, I propose that the Forsaken, although evil and deep in the 
Shadow, are not as evil as the Dark One, nor the essence of evil that the 
Dark One is.  Using this as the basis for my theory, consider the possibility
~
E
page16~
        Point 4 is more a statement of the seals' function, however, looking
deeper into this statement, it is a possibility that their function is part
of their nature.  Or, more succinctly, their function and nature are closely
linked.  Examine, for a moment, the purpose of the seals:  To keep the Dark
One and the Forsaken within the Bore, to seal it.  Could it be that the 
nature of the seals draws on their purpose?  To continue their purpose, 
~
E
page15~
        Logically, point 1 should not be the reason they work as they do.  If
that were so, simply because they are cuendillar, we would be able to use any
cuendillar artifacts we have as seals.  Points 2 and 3 conflict, and thus
will be glazed over in this part of the discussion; they bear no significance
in the nature of how the seals work.  This leaves points 4 and 5 as possible
answers to the nature of how the seals work.
~
E
page14~
        2.  They are unbreakable.
        3.  They are weakening.
        4.  They are the focal points that hold the Dark One within his
            prison, along with the Forsaken.
        5.  They were placed by male Aes Sedai.
~
E
page13~
        That is my theory on the nature of the seals themselves, as physical
entities, and one reason as to why they may be weakening.  However, what of
the question of the nature of how the seals work?
        Consider what we know of the seals already:
        1.  They are made of cuendillar.
~
E
page12~
completion of the process.  This makes me wonder whether Aes Sedai of our time
could perhaps complete the cuendillarisation process, and thus strengthen the
seals on the Dark One's prison.  Perhaps this will be rediscovered before 
Tarmon Gai'don.  I believe, though, that the seals will play a large part in
the Dark One's resealment into his prison, regardless.  Perhaps knew seals
will be made, successfully.
~
E
page11~
of imperfect cuendillarisation of the seals, as mentioned above.
        However, since we do not know how cuendillar was actually made, this
theory is simply that, a theory.  Perhaps if we knew more, we might be able
to work out the reason for why the seals weaken as they do.  If my theory
was correct, however, it may be that the cuendillarisation process was only
part way completed, and thus over time the seals have weakened due to lack of

E
page10~
Sedai, in advance, and thus had no part in it, or b) the female Aes Sedai of
the time took no part in male Aes Sedai's strike because they did not
countenance it.  This would indicate that, based on my theory of 
cuendillarisation of common materials, the male Aes Sedai cuendillarised the
seals that would be used as focal points for the Dark One's prison alone,
without the aid of female Aes Sedai.  This seems to lend weight to the theory
~
E
page9~
simply be a once off occurrence?  Perhaps it was!
        Consider some key things we know of the Age of Legends: the greatest 
feats of the One Power were accomplished by men and women working together; 
the sealing of the Bore was accomplished by only male Aes Sedai.  Given these
two factors, we can logically assume that the female Aes Sedai of the time
were either a) not informed of the action that would be taken by the male Aes
~
E
page8~
that exist today.  Perhaps, through the One Power, normal everyday ores and
materials can be 'cuendillarised', a term I will use to represent this belief.
        Now, considering this, it is probable that the seals, when
cuendillarised, were done so imperfectly, which would explain their weakening
in recent times.  However, this raises the question of why other cuendillar
objects also do not weaken.  Surely imperfect cuendillarisation could not

E
page7~
cuendillar was indeed shapeable, how was such shapeing achieved?  The obvious
answer is through the One Power.  However, such attempts made by myself proved
unsuccessful.  This simply could be a lack of knowledge, of course, but I
have another theory.  Perhaps cuendillar was not actually made and then
shaped.  Perhaps, instead, objects were made, and then formed into cuendillar.
This would seem far more logical, given the variety of objects of cuendillar
~
E
page6~
            or at least bear no change.
        4.  Cuendillar was shapeable, somehow, during the Age of Legends,
            since there are many artifacts surviving today which bear various
            shapes.
        Given the above points, I draw the reader's attention to point 4.  If

        1.  It is made through the One Power.
        2.  It is unbreakable.
        3.  Attempts to break cuendillar only seem to make it stronger, though
            that comment in itself is slightly incorrect given the statement
            of point 2.  Something already unbreakable should not be made
            stronger, or even weaker, but should logically remain the same,

know of the substance, apart from that it was made through the One Power, is
unbreakable, and is very rare in today's society?  Perhaps it is in our
understanding of the very nature of cuendillar which lies our key to learning
of the nature of the seals.  Thus, I have endeavoured to study cuendillar, 
the findings of which follow:

propose various theories concerning the nature of the seals, the nature of
what makes them work, and how they work.
        It is well known - or should be - that the seals are made of 
cuendillar, a substance made with the One Power that is unbreakable.  The 
making of cuendillar is of course lost to us, along with so much else, but
is our understanding of cuendillar?  By this, I mean, how much do we honestly

The Dark One's counterstroke caused the taint on Saidin, and led to every
male Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends going mad, beginning the Time of Madness
and the Breaking of the World.  However, in all of the mentionings made by
various scholars concerning the seals, none ever intimated how they worked,
or more definitively, the nature of what makes them work, or indeed the
very nature of the seals themselves.  It is here, in these pages, that I will

The Nature of the Seals on the Dark One's Prison

A Theory by Siomaydra Demieynn
        During the course of my studies, I came across several entries in
books mentioning the seals that seal the Dark One within his prison.  As most
know, the seals were used as focal points to reseal the Dark One in prison,
along with the Forsaken, by Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.

and it was caused by male channelers going mad.  Hence, the only rational 
course open to us is to gentle these channelers, thus saving the lives of

Periodically, a man declares himself the Dragon Reborn, attracting

Three thousand years ago, during the Age of Legends, male and female

of the most powerful channelers of the time, whom we now call the Forsaken.

The Almoth Plain lies on the Aryth Ocean, between the nations of Arad
Doman and Tarabon, who have squabbled over claim to the region for 300
years. The region is not a united country, and has no central
government. Each of the independent towns and villages is governed by
a mayor and a Village Council.

Falme, on the tip of the Toman Head peninsula, is the largest
population center in the region, and it is little more than a large,

houses are roofed with slate.

Men wear full-sleeved shirts, baggy trousers, and knee-length vests.
Women wear long dresses. Both wear long sheepskin coats with the
fleece turned in. Clothes are usually decorated with brightly-coloured
spirals embroidered on the chest.

Altara lies on the Sea of Storms, bordered by Illian to the east,
Murandy to the northeast, Ghealdan to the northwest, and Amadicia to
the west. It is not a particularly powerful nation. The ruler has
little power, and many of the Noble Houses have no qualms about
ignoring or defying their ruler. Squabbles between the noble houses
for power can be fairly bloody.
~
E
page2~
Altara has a reputation for being a violent, unsavoury place,
particularly in its capital of Ebou Dar. Altarans are a fierce people,
and both men and women will duel over the slightest insult.
Horse-racing is a popular entertainment, with boys acting as the
jockeys.
~
E
page3~
Altarans are of average height, with a medium skin tone. Most have
dark hair and dark eyes. Women wear their hair to their shoulders, or
even shorter. They wear pale dresses with deep, narrow necklines.
Their skirts are gathered up to the knee on one side to display
colourful petticoats. Married women wear a marriage dagger at their
throats, and the colour and gem settings of the dagger is a code that
indicates marital status and information about their children.
~
E
page4~
Men wear square-cut beards and long mustaches. They wear long,
colourful vests, with no shirt, or a pale, wide-sleeved shirt.
Noblemen wear small silk coats as capes slung across their shoulders.
Otherwise, men and women wear the same styles whether they are noble
or commoner, the clothing of nobles being made from finer cloth and
more elaborately embroidered.
~
E
page5~
Ebou Dar is the largest city in Altara, and home to the Tarasin
Palace. The Rahad Quarter is avoided by all who value their lives and
their money. Inns in the Rahad Quarter are marked only by blue doors.
Fishing is probably the most common occupation in the city.

are outlawed in Amadicia. Any found are turned over to the King's army
or the Children of the Light. The fear of being branded a witch is so
great there is no word for Wisdom in this country and any woman who
practices the healing arts does so carefully. Because of this, male
hedge doctors are quite common.

                            THE NATION OF ANDOR

Andor lies in the center of the known world, bounded on the west by
the Mountains of Mist, on the east by Cairhien, on the south by
Ghealdan and Murandy, and on the north by wilderness. A class system
exists in Andor, with the nobility dominant, but all citizens are
treated fairly by that nobility.
~
E
page2~
Queens have ruled Andor for centuries. The Queen's brother is Prince
Regent and Captain-General of her armies. A Governor of the Queen
administrates the larger towns. Villages are governed by a Mayor and a
Village Council, and a Wisdom and a Women's Circle. The Queen's Guard
keeps the peace in Caemlyn and throughout the countryside and larger
towns are walled and patrolled by a Town Watch.
~
E
page3~
The Andoran Queens are among the few rulers to openly admit to keeping
Aes Sedai advisors. It is traditional for the Daughter-Heir to train
with the Aes Sedai, and her brother to train with the Warders, at Tar
Valon. Not all Andorans approve of these associations and traditions.

Most Andorans are dark-haired and dark-eyed people of medium height
with a medium skin tone. Blondes and light-eyed people are rare,
though the Andoran nobility is known for its red hair and blue eyes.
~
E
page4~
Andoran men wear trousers, shirts and coats, the women wear long
dresses, and both wear cloaks in cold weather. Class distinctions are
displayed through differences in the quality of cut and cloth. Most of
the smaller villages have a way of distinguishing a mature woman, such
as a braid or a bonnet.
~
E
page5~
Metals mined in the Mountains of Mist are Andor's most important
products, though tabac and wool are also important industries. The
vast majority of Andorans consider such things as Trollocs and Fades
to be nothing more than fantastic legends. People outside of Andor
believe that horrific creatures wander the Mountains of Mist.

The Inner City and the palace of Caemlyn were built by Ogier, though
the city has expanded outside the original walls, an area called the
New City.
~
E
page6~
Baerlon's population swells seasonally when miners and smelters come
down from their shanty towns in the Mountains of Mist.  Whitebridge and
Four Kings both make the majority of their income from merchants and 
traders, as both are on major thoroughfares. Whitebridge has the only 
bridge crossing the Arinelle south of Maradon in Saldaea.
~
E
page7~
The Two Rivers area, made up of the villages of Emond's Field, Taren
Ferry, Deven Ride and Watch Hill, lies to the far west. Technically
considered part of Andor, the Two Rivers has not seen a tax collector
or Queen's Guard in seven generations, and few of its residents
consider themselves Andoran.

                         THE NATION OF ARAD DOMAN

Arad Doman lies to the northwest, on the Aryth Ocean. Saldaea is to
its northeast, and Almoth Plain to the south. Tarabon and Arad Doman
have squabbled over the possession of the Almoth Plain region for
three hundred years.
~
E
page2~
Most Domani are tall and willowy, with dark hair and copper-coloured
skin. The men wear their hair shoulder-length, and sport long, thin
mustaches and close- trimmed beards. They wear long leather vests,
earrings, and frequently a choker or bracelet made of precious metals.
~
E
page3~
The women wear clinging dresses made of thin cloth, tied with a narrow
belt. The use of cosmetics and artificial beauty marks is common.
Domani women are infamous the world over for their beauty and
seductiveness. They use flirtation to gain any advantage they can in
business and politics, and have made an art out of flirtation and
~
E
page4~
seduction, even categorizing types of kisses and touches.

The nobility wear bracelets marked with the symbols of their Houses. A
fair number of Domani are merchants, trading in fur and timber. The
Domani eat with red-lacquered chopsticks called sursa. Food dishes are
vegetables and meats in sharp, sweet sauces. Bandar Eban is well-known
for its fine library.

One of the Borderlands, Arafel is bordered by Kandor on its west,
Shienar on its east, wilderness to the south, and the foul Blight to
the north.  The Arafellin have strange ideas about honour and death.
At least some Arafellin are pale-skinned with dark eyes.  The Arafellin
wear silver bells in their hair. Men wear their hair in two long braids
with silver bells tied at the ends.

                          THE NATION OF CAIRHIEN

The Spine of the World mountain range forms Cairhien's eastern border,
and the nation is equidistant between the northern and southern
portions of the continent. The mountains of Kinslayer's Dagger border
Cairhien to the north.

Much of the country is hilly land, and the Cairhien terrace those
hills for building and farming purposes. Many noble houses support
vineyards on their terraced estates. The village Tremonsien grows
barley and oats.
~
E
page2~
Cairhien's culture is sharply divided along class lines. The upper
classes care little about the lower. Cairhienin display a formal
facade, though members of the lower classes are much more relaxed with
each other. The Noble Houses vie amongst each other for power, and the
country's ruler is the head of the most powerful House, whether male
or female.
~
E
page3~
Daes Dae'mar, the Game of Houses, is a national obsession. The
nobility jockey constantly for power and position, using commoners as
pawns or assassins. The commoners seek any information that might be
sold to the nobility. While the Game of Houses is played among the
nobility of almost all southern nations, it is taken to extremes in
Cairhien.
~
E
page4~
The Cairhien are a very short people, with dark hair and dark eyes.  The
upper classes wear dark clothing marked with coloured stripes on the chest
to denote rank. Noblemen wear bell-shaped or flat velvet caps, noblewomen
wear their hair piled high, and skirts several feet wide. Both wear pale
lacy ruffles at their cuffs. In contrast, many of the lower classes dress
as flamboyantly as Tinkers. Respectable members of the middle class usually
~
E
page5~
emulate the somber dress of the nobles, but use cheaper cuts and materials.

Cairhien was once the only nation esteemed by the Aiel, who gave the
Cairhienin Avendoraldera, a sapling of the Tree of Life, over four
hundred years ago. Then twenty years ago, King Laman chopped it down
to build a throne, starting the Aiel War. The War ravaged Cairhien,
~
E
page6~
and many farms and towns were destroyed. The country no longer
produces enough food to support the refugees that still crowd the
capital, and must import grain from Tear and Andor. Interruption in
those imports would likely result in riots.
~
E
page7~
Ogier from Stedding Shangtai are often hired to do masonry work in the
capital. Though few Ogier like working for the Cairhienin because of
their demanding and non-artistic natures, the Cairhienin accept the
Ogier, and they are sought- after guests among the nobility.
~
E
page8~
Visiting Aes Sedai are also desired guests for the Nobles, though the
majority of Cairhienin view them and their use of the Power with some
trepidation.

                             THE NATION OF ILLIAN

Illian lies on the Sea of Storms. Altara borders it on the west, and
Murandy to the north. The Plains of Maredo separate Illian from Tear
to the east. The two have a tense relationship that occasionally
erupts into armed conflict. The climate is hot and damp, and rains are
heavy in the "cooler" season. The capital city is built on a marsh,
and has as many canals as it does streets.
~
E
page2~
Illian's government is complex. It is ruled by a King, the Council of
Nine (Nobles) and the Assemblage (commoners). The politicians are so
busy squabbling amongst themselves that they rarely interfere with the
daily lives of citizens.
~
E
page3~
Common men often sport beards that leave their upper lips bear, and
the women wear wide hats tied under the chin with colourful scarves.
Fishing and shipping are common occupations along Illian's extensive
coastline. It is traditional for business people to share profits with
employees as a work incentive. As in many hot countries, life moves at
a slower pace than to the north.
~
E
page4~
Illian is famed as the sponsor of the Hunt for the Horn of Valere. The
Hunt was last called four hundred years ago, and is still a popular
subject of song and story. Before the Hunt begins, the Hunters gather
in the city of Illian for the Blessing, as well as days of festivals.
A more frequent festival is the annual Feast of Teven. Contests and
prizes for gleemen are part of the celebration.
~
E
page5~
Aes Sedai are feared and despised by most in Illian, and few will
handle Tar Valon marks, though there is no law against trading with
Aes Sedai. Some women Illianers think that Aes Sedai aren't so bad as
rumoured.

to the south is only wilderness, ruins and isolated communities.
~

Kandor and its people have not been extensively documented in the
novels to date. However, a few things are known. Most Kandori men wear
earrings, and forked beards. Merchants wear chains of precious metals
looped across the chests of their coats.

The merchants of Kandor are formed into guilds, and they travel across

                         THE FORMER NATION OF MALKIER

Until its fall in 953, Malkier was the oldest modern nation, and one of
the few to survive the War of a Hundred years. It occupied an area 
bordered by the Mountains of Dhoom to the north, and Shienar and Arafel 
to the south.
~
E
page2~
Prior to its destruction, it was a noble land battling to keep the
forces of the Dark at bay. Jealousy and strife in the royal family led
to a weakening of its armies, and Malkier was unable to defend itself
from the Trolloc hordes that took advantage of this weakness. The
survivors of the invasion fled south, most taking up residence in
other Borderlands, and Malkier fell to the Blight.
~
E
page3~
Traditional titles for the king included Lord of the Seven Towers, and
Lord of the Lakes, a reference to Malkier's fabled thousand lakes.
Each of its kings and queens took an oath to fight against the Shadow,
and the king carried a sword which never grew dull. When a king died
without issue, the Great Lords of the land cast rods upon the Crowning
Stone to select the new king.

                         THE NATION-STATE OF MAYENE

Mayene is a small city-state on a peninsula at the far southeast of
the world, on the Sea of Storms. A bordering peninsula to the west is
occupied by Tear, to the southwest is the Sea Folk island of
Cindaking, and to the north is an area known as the Drowned Lands, and
beyond that, the Spine of the World.
~
E
page2~
Tear has been seeking to annex Mayene for many centuries, but the
state defends itself by playing Daes Dae'mar. Despite the support of
the Sea Folk, it could never dare to openly anger Tear. Tear sees it
as an economic rival, as the oil found in its secret oilfish shoals
competes with Tear's olive oil exports.
~
E
page3~
The ruling line of Mayene claims it is descended from Artur Hawking
himself. Mayene's guard is known as the Winged Guards. Mayeners of
both genders are accustomed to speaking their minds openly, in
romantic or other matters. Little else is known of Mayene at this
point.

To the north of Murandy is Andor, to the south, Illian. Altara lies to
the southwest, and Ghealdan to the west. Fine wine and delicate lace
are two of Murandy's most famous exports.
~
E
page2~
Murandy does not think of itself as a nation. Citizens' primary
allegiance is to a particular town or Noble family. Both commoners and
Nobles frequently ignore the dictates of their monarch. The only impetus
keeping it anything of a nation at all, is fear of being absorbed by 
Illian, or Andor, with which it has a tense relationship at best.
~

Murandian men wear curled mustaches and goatees, high-crowned hats,

heads.

Saldaea is one of the Borderlands, lying far to the northwest. Its
eastern neighbour is Kandor, and south lies the Almoth Plain. The
Ogier-built capital city is known for its high towers, from which one
can see the Blight. To the west is the Aryth Ocean. Timber, furs and
ice peppers are its major products.
~

Saldaeans are a strong-willed people, with somewhat complicated

sculpture statue fountain warders wolf~
Before you is a carefully sculpted statue, seamlessly worked
in silver, bronze and steel. The image made by it is two men,
both warders,  and a dark grey wolf, standing on a large rock
in the middle of a small pool. One man is taller and slimmer
than the other, his hair having fallen in his face, a slim sword
at his hip, and the other is more muscular, with longer hair
and an axe in his hand. The wolf between the two is a dark
grey, save its four paws, which are silver. Sparkling blue
water surrounds the trio, hidden amongst the trees in the
garden. At the base of the sculpture is a small plaque.

From the center of the fountain rises a massive granite statue, it's

look of triumph marks his features as he draws his last breath, knowing

The Warder's Creed is carved deeply into the granite rim of the fountain.
