The long slender blade looks expertly made, much like those of 
tempered by the master smiths of Tear. One difference is obvious however,
the blade is as dark and black as the Dark Ones heart and the finest cut of
the superb edge can fester and kill within moments. Seasoned with the soul of
a human captive this blade is one to be reckoned with in the hands of the Eyeless.

pen~
The large wooden pen seems to be made of the thorned branches of a 
blackberry. Its only gate standing ajar. From within can be heard 
pitiful sobs of the weak and wretched, too sick or injured to even
attempt to crawl out of the enclosure. Some cry out in vain for the 
Lights salvation while others lie still knowing their fate. As you 
watch a large goat-faced trolloc lumbers through the entrance and 
drags out another human. No resistance met the trolloc takes him
back to his greedy peers at the cookfire.

Small raised points on what appears to be a remnant of the skull seems
to confirm their origins. The hybrid spawn of trolloc and human are

quite hot. The discolouration should not have occured so rapidly. The

Small holes in the base of the wrist suggest that something was implanted

be a fang of silver among the black. The three pronged trident of
the Ko'bal is scratched across the large hilt, making this a 
trolloc sword. A sword whos wounds will fester and kill as surely
