TOWER OF THE MORNING
To use this form, keeps your legs apart with your
knees bent, and ensure that your feet are in a 
straight line at distance, so if the back knee is
set down it is near the heel of the front foot.
The toes should be angled inwards, and the sword
held at guard.  Step back and pull your sword in
towards your chest, then sweep it up to parry a 
downward slash.  Open your stance slight and turn
the body as you deliver a downward diagonal slash
across the base of your enemies neck.

introduction~
Combat, like any other day to day activity, will eventually
become a routine.  This, I stress, is very important:  DO 
NOT let that happen.  Every time you kill, it must be as the
first time, or you will become like that which we fight 
against more than anything, the Darkness.  Take no pleasure
in killing, and always pity your foe.  After all, even the
lowliest of shadowspawn, the trolloc, obeys it's dark master
only because it was created to do so.  Nevertheless, you
must never waver, you must always face even the most 
fiersome of beasts in order to protect your Aes Sedai.  In
this book I will descibe to you many different tecniques
used with a sword, and the following book I write will be
designed to teach more specialized methods of fighting, such
as with two swords, one in each hand, or against multiple
opponents, all fought simultaneously.  On that note, enjoy
this book, but do not enjoy the subject matter.
~
E
bundlingstraw~
BUNDLING STRAW
This is an excellent form for beginners, as it is both a defense
and a counterattack.  It is not that hard to execute once you have
learned the basics of balance, how to hold a sword, and how to
hold a good stance that works for you.  Well, before I ramble on
overly much, here is a description of the form.
FORM DESCRIPTION-  Hold your sword parallel to your body, point up, and then
move it across your body, to parry an attack.  Immediately after
you have parried, slash downwards at your opponents stomach and
legs, moving the sword in the opposite direction as before.
~
E
waterfall~
WATERFALL ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE
This is a purely defensive sword tecnique, used to
defend yourself from an attack from behind.  Without
further ado, here is a description of the form.
FORM DESCRIPTION- With your arms raised above your
head, place the sword flat against your back.  This,
in all likelihood, will be a successful defense 
against slashing attacks from the rear.
~
E
sunrises~
THE SUN RISES
This form can be used for either attack or defense,
depending upon the circumstances in which you are
using it.  To attack, slash upwards at the chest of an 
unarmored opponent with the tip of your blade.  Note,
however, that your opponent must be unarmored.  The
odds specify that if you try this against, say a
Child of the Light, your blade will simply bounce
harmlessly off of his plate armor.
To use it as a defense, do the same and use it against
low attacks.  In ideal conditions you will not allow
it to throw you out of position, and it will in turn
send your opponents sword high, allowing for a quick 
low attack, such as River Undercuts the Bank. 
~
E
thornbush~
LIZARD IN THE THORNBUSH
This is a very simple sword form, in theory, but
in practice is much more complicated, because it
has to be done very quickly and precisely.  A
lunging thrust to the throat of your enemy, followed
by a quick slash across his torso, is all you are
required to do with this form.  It sounds easy,
but you must do it quickly or leave yourself open.
However, if you are dextrous enough, this is a 
very useful tecnique when facing several opponents,
as it allows you to take one of them out of the
equation, and very fast.
~
E
heronspreads~
HERON SPREADS HIS WINGS
This is another attack tecnique, and a very
aptly named one at that.  Firstly, both arms
are spread out and up, like a heron spreading
it's wings, the blade slashes upward from 
your opponents groin to his throat.  Remember,
thought, to quickly bring your defense back 
into order, or you will be wide open and
extrememly vulnerable.
~
E
stonesfalling~
STONES FALLING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
This is a two slash attack.  First you must slash
your opponents temple, back-handedly, and second
you will bring the sword up, continuiing in the
same direction as the original slash, mind you,
and then circle around to slash at the base of
the enemies neck.
~
E
swallowtakes~
THE SWALLOW TAKES FLIGHT
This sword form can be used in one of two ways.  You
can either use it to defend against one attack, then
counterattack, or use it to defend against one attack,
then against yet another.  To defend, hold the sword
vertically while turning your body away from the 
attack.  After this, you can either counterattack, or
defend again.  To counterattack, follow with a rising
backhand slash to the side your enemies head or neck.
If you wish to defend again, parry while holding the
sword diagonally down, and step away from the attack.
~
E
threeprongs~
LIGHTNING OF THE THREE PRONGS
This is three, tightly controlled, lightning fast
thrusts to the head of your opponent.  Be careful
in how you do this, or you may pull yourself out
of position.  It takes a great deal of practice
to master the forms which prerequisitely require
a great deal of speed.  First thrust at the left
of your opponents head, then the right, then at
the center.
~
E
breeze~
LEAF ON THE BREEZE
Spin halfway around from the waist up, keeping your
feet firmly planted on the ground, and perform three
quick parries, followed by spinning back and making
a short slash to your opponents upper-body. 
~
E
wateredsilk~
WATERED SILK
If you should ever, for a reason beyond the understanding
of this simple swordsman, find yourself crouching during
a fight, this is a form which might be able to get you out
of a tight situation.  A slash across the abdomen, followed
by a strong thrust to the heart, and your opponent is 
either dead or possibly on the defensive, giving you a 
chance to stand up and organize a strategy.  Note, you must
hold the sword parallel to the ground as you thrust at
your opponents heart.

Actual advancement at this level is at GL discretion.  Instructors also need to talk to the MoI and demonstrate a willingness and ability to teach.
It should be noted that this ranking is attainable solely as a reflection of the degree of IC training you have chosen to acquire.  It is not required that you complete any of the Instructor/Veteran form lessons unless you are looking for the rank.  The ranks are not intended to be used as an OOC or IC excuse to lord it over any other Gaidin, and harsh disciplinary action will be taken if such actions occur.

Parting The Silk: Attack: Bring your weapon in a horizontal
slash from left to right, across the upper chest of your
opponent. Follow up by stepping forward and lashing your weapon
down from their right shoulder to opposite hip.

Arc of The Moon: Defense and Counter: Bring your weapon across in
a high horizontal arc designed to knock aside an incoming
downward or diagonal slash. Respond by lashing your blade from
left to right, across your opponent's throat.

Whirlwind on the Mountain: Attack: Step forward, bringing
your weapon in a vertical slash, down across your opponent's
right arm in an attempt to severely damage the motion of the
limb. Quickly step to your right, following up with a horizontal
slash at armpit level, from right to left.

Black Pebbles on Snow: Defence and counter: Block an incoming
thrust or diagonal attack by batting it up and away from its
intended target. Bring your blade low and slashing in a
horizontal arc across their gut, if right handed, left if left.
When completing the slash, your weapon should be beginning to arc
back upwards to block your opponent's response.

Lion on the Hill: Defence and counter: Designed to block a
thrust to the chest or stomach, sidestep to the right if right
handed, left if left handed, bringing your weapon across your
body to knock the attack down and askew. Counter by bringing your
weapon backhandedly across your opponent's stomach.

The Falcon Stoops: Attack: With left foot forward and blade at
ready position, take a step forward with your right foot,
slashing from your opponent's left shoulder to right hip, a quick
slash that sacrifices strength and force for speed. Immediately
after this feint, step back to give your blade room to play,
before stepping forward again and driving your weapon in a
thrusting attack at your opponent's sternum.

~
E
level2~
Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose: Defence and Counter: Block an
incoming thrusting attack at chest or stomach by parrying the
attack wide to your right if so handed, left if so handed.

the soft part under your opponent's chin.

Soft Rain at Sunset: Defence and Counter: Block an incoming
thrust to the chest or stomach by batting the attack to the right
if right handed, left if left, then quickly step forward, lifting
your blade and bringing it down in a controlled but hard stroke
aimed to split the skull of your opponent from crown to teeth.

The Rose Unfolds: Unsheathing Defence: Used as an immediate
defence when someone is attacking with steel, draw your weapon
and with a single controlled sweep, bring it across in front of
you from left to right, blade held vertically and ready to knock
aside any incoming attacks. If your opponent is left handed, add
a reverse stroke after the first motion is completed, bringing
your weapon back from right to left.

Wind Blows Over The Wall: Attack: Feint a slash at your
opponent's left hip, a short horizontal stroke from left to
right. Follow up by stepping forward and to the right, bringing
your weapon above your opponent's, assuming they have gone for
the feint and then thrust for their larynx.

Wind and Rain: Disarming maneuver: Feint for your opponent's
throat or face, forcing them to commit to the defence, before
lashing your weapon hard across the bycept of their sword arm.

Moon Rises Over the Lakes: Defence and counter: Designed to
block an incoming thrust at chest or stomach, sidestep hard and
turn your body more towards the thrusting opponent, bringing your
weapon in a hard, controlled but very quick slash across the
tender skin of their flank, below the ribs and above the hip.

the chest, step to the right if you are right handed, to the left
if left handed, then bring your weapon across your body to knock
the incoming attack up and away from its mark.

hilt held at waist level, tip slightly off parallel to the
ground, pointing down. With left foot advanced, step forward hard
with your right and snap your wrists violently upward as you
close with your opponent, the tip of your weapon rising rapidly
to rip your opponent open from their abdomen to their chest in a
hard, rising slash.

Stones Falling From The Mountain: Attack: With left foot leading,
blade in two hands, step forward towards your opponent, bringing
your weapon down hard at the crown of their skull, a virtical
slash designed to split their head open from crown to collarbone.

Dove Takes Flight: defence and counter: Designed to defend
against a broad high slash or thrust at the face or throat,
quickly duck, step forward and thrust with your weapon up at
either below the juncture of your opponent's rib cage or at the
chest.

left foot forward, and right back, hilt held at waist, tip at

pillar policy ooc~
Policy concerning NPC Tower Guards:

1.  Protocol needs to be followed to prevent IC and OOC confusion.
2.  Failure to follow protocol will not be tolerated.  Illaria and Antan reserve the right to null any RP involving Tower Guard NPCs that does not adhere to protocol.
3.  Protocol is as follows:
Command protocol
1.  The Amyrlin Seat (read amyrlin)
2.  The Keeper / Hall of the Tower (read keeper or read hall)
3.  The Tower Guard Captain (read captain)
4.  Miscellaneous (read miscellaneous)
Report protocol
1.  Mailing (read mailing)
2.  IC and OOC propriety (read propriety)
~
E
amyrlin~
The Amyrlin has absolute command of the Tower Guards.  If she talks, they listen, and obey absolutely.  Therefore, if a post is made by Elaida or The Amyrlin Seat on a board, giving details of a guard assignment to a prisoner or what have you, and setting forth the rules for visitation... those rules and details are law.  No exceptions will be made to them for anyone.
~
E
hall keeper~
Their word is likewise law, but they can be countermanded by the Amyrlin.  Otherwise, the same rules apply to them as to her, as far as postings about the Tower Guards go.

~
E
captain~
He can be ordered about only by the Amyrlin, the Keeper, or the Hall.  If he gives an order, the Tower Guards will obey.  All the orders from the Keeper or Amyrlin go through him, so he knows ICly about all of them.  He will receive reports if there is any IC event in which Tower Guards are emoted as NPCs, and if he does not receive a report, the RP is subject to nullification, without a hearing from the Council.
~
E
miscellaneous~
If a prisoner is assigned Tower Guards to guard him or her, the prisoner is responsible for emoting them realistically, and for making sure that they follow the orders given them by the Tower Guard Captain, Amyrlin, Hall, or Keeper.  If the orders are not followed, it is the prisoner's fault unless the guards are ICly killed or otherwise incapacitated to prevent them from doing so.
If an Aes Sedai is assigned a contingent of Tower Guards to aid her in some mission, she is responsible for emoting them in keeping with their IC orders, again unless something happens to them to prevent the execution of their orders.
If someone of sufficient rank to change the orders of the Tower Guards is present, they may assume command of the Guards in either of the above situations and emote them themselves.
Most importantly - if you don't know what would be appropriate in a given situation... ASK A TOWER GUILDLEADER!!!!!!
~
E
mailing~
If something happens while you have a Tower Guard assigned to you as an NPC, you are responsible for mailing the Tower Guard Captain to let him know about it, in the form of IC reports from the guard or guards.  If you want to -get- some Tower Guards for some IC project, you mail him as well.
~
E
propriety~
If you are trusted with the RP of an NPC Tower Guard, you will use the privilege appropriately, both OOCly and ICly.  No abuse of this sort of trust will be tolerated.

\c00Hey folks.
Ok, I've taken the time to clean up these boards a bit and to
remove most of the posts from the previous gls who ran these
guilds. I'm going to repost this so that everyone can read it in
one sitting and  are assured that it's completely current.
1) Respect to the Masters: The MOI and MOT are two very
challenging jobs for morts to take on. Please treat these two
with respect and courtesy and try not to get on their back about
problems. If there is something wrong, please let them know, talk
it out with them in a civil manner so that it can be resolved
favorably for all parties involved. The two Masters of the
Warders run this guild, I'm just here to officiate things and to
make sure that everything runs smoothly.
2) Trainees and Instructors: to all trainees, remember that you
are trainees, that you are initiates into this craft of fighting.
Your instructors have years, most likely decades of experience
more than any trainee will ever have. Please take that to heart
when you are sparring with your instructors. In no way should an
instructor lose a spar unless he or she means to do so. All the
instructors here are excellent rpers and have been carefully
chosen for their positions and I trust that they will not abuse
that authority. I just ask that you, the trainees, please try to
keep in mind that you are such and refrain from thinking that you
can stomp on your teachers. I'm sure you might be frustrated
enough sometimes, but it's just logical.
3) Ic Consequences: Please keep in mind, always, that whatever
you say and do icly, you have to take responsibility for. Please
do not, as an example, go up to an Aes Sedai and call her a
witch, it just doesn't go over very well and you should expect to
have to deal with the consequences of such an action. I merely
mean this as an example and it goes for all the guildees here,
even when relating to the mud as a whole.
4) Multiple TW Alts: You may create more than one Tower Warder
Alt, this is perfectly fine with me, however, keep in mind, that
you will have to reseek the tower as if you had never been here.
No favoritism will be shown to you merely because you already
have a TW alt. Backgrounds will still need to be submitted to me
and approved and sponsors acquired.
5) Non-guilded folk in the Tower: Visitors are allowed
unaccompanied in the Tower Lobby  and in the Tower Gardens. They
are not allowed access to the basement levels at all, they may go
into the living  areas accompanied by someone of at least Aes
Sedai rank or those Graduated from Warder training. 
Anyone going to the third floor, where the library and the  hall
of the tower, along with the Amyrlin's and Keeper's   offices,
must be either guilded to the Aes Sedai or have   Aes Sedai
escort and Warder escort (if not a warder)
6) OoC DEbonding: This is merely an issue of respect. Please, if
a Warder or an Aes Sedai, your bondmate, asks that oocly they be
debonded from you, remember that this is perfectly acceptable. We
are here to have fun and to play a game, not to create problems
and hard feelings amongst anyone. It would be nice if people
could work out their problems but sometimes issues are
unreconcilable and this step deemed necessary.
7) Major Events: If you or anyone you know, is planning on having
a major event either in, or involving the White Tower, please
mail both Cassin and Illaria on the matter so that we aren't left
clueless. This is merely a courtesy issue, we aren't going to
tell you that you can't have your event, but we would like the
details so that if any questions are asked of us, we know how to
respond.
8) Tower guardsman: Please see the rules posted in both
Guildareas for the rules concerning Tower Guards.


Continued. Type read rules2 to get the last bit.
~
E
rules2~
\c00
9) The Shadow and your bondmates: Please, out of respect for your
bondmate, if you are a member of the shadow before bonding, or
become a member of the shadow while bonded, please let your
bondmate know this before either you bond, or when you choose to
take this step. It is merely common courtesy to do so, mainly
because involvement in the shadow, if you are bonded, does not
only have consequences to your own char, but the char of your
bondmate.
10) Men in the tower: Novices are not to -ever- be in the warder
barracks, in   any room of it, unless accompanied by an Aes Sedai
and for more reason than a social visit. They are not to be 
alone with us in private areas, or living chambers,   and never
alone with us behind closed doors. Consequently, we are   not
allowed in the Novice living areas, unless there is   an Aes
Sedai present. Novices can go into the practice  yards, but if
they behave inappropriately there, they   can expect punishment.
Novices are free to associate  with us in any public area,
no closed  doors, so long as it does not interfere with their
lessons.
Accepted are a bit more free, and will not be punished 
for being in the warder practice yards. Accepted may go   into
the public areas within the warder barracks, such as   the warder
mess, the library, and the smithy. (No, not  the baths.) We are
allowed in the public areas of the   Accepted living quarters,
including the accepted garden,   and the wash. Accepted are not
allowed into the private  rooms of men, nor are men allowed into
their rooms.   Again, no closed doors, having a man of the tower
help move an Accepted's furniture is acceptable, if the door is
open.
Comments or whatever else, mail me or Illaria.
Cassin
