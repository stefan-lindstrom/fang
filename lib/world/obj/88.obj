be human. It curves and twists in ways no human should be able to in its mad
dance. Flat gray in color, it seems as if it will break apart in a strong
breeze, but for all of that it would survive a drop from even the highest height.

parchment rules farm asha'man~
1.  Saidin must be used in performing all tasks and chores.

2.  Subordinate Asha'man shall always salute their superiors properly,
    with right fist to chest.

3.  Only Dedicated and Asha'man may leave the farm.  All subordinate
    ranks must be properly escorted.

4.  Recruits may only seize Saidin under the supervision of a Dedicated
    or Asha'man.

5.  Asha'man of all ranks are required to attend Morning Directives, where
    roll will be called and the Lord Dragon's orders will be read.  Failure
    to be present without the M'Hael's express permission will result in
    dire consequences.  Absentees will be treated as deserters.

tree traitor's asha'man~
The Traitor's Tree looms darkly here, set off in a clearing by itself.  The
ground beneath is bare of grass or greenery, stark and ominous like the owner
of this hallowed ground.  Heads hang from the stiff branches, heads of Asha'man
who have forsaken their brothers and their cause.  As you look on, you get the
impression that this tree bears its sinister purpose with a dark pride.
