* Note: all lines between records which start with '*' are comments and

* This file is where the messages go for spells.
*
* All records must start with 'M' in the first column (for 'Message').
* The next line must contain the spell number (defined in spells.h),
* then the messages (one per line):
*
* Death-message (caster, target_cant_chann, target_can_chann_!same_sex,target_can_chann_same_sex,
*                onlookers(same with can/cant channel))

* Hit-message   (caster, target_cant_chann, target_can_chann_!same_sex,target_can_chann_same_sex,
* All messages must be contained in one line.  They will be sent through
* act(), meaning that all standard act() codes apply, and each message will
* automatically be wrapped to 79 columns when they are printed.  '#' can
* be substituted for a message if none should be printed.  Note however
* that, unlike the socials file, all twelve lines must be present for each
* record, regardless of any '#' fields which may be contained in it.
*
* The stupid layout of act, makes it hard to do good messages for onlookers
* either you have to exclude the caster, or the target. For now, the caster
* wont be a part of the message if it's a damage spell, i.e. has a target.
* the  victim will be excluded if it's a creative spell. See below for 
* examples
