~-~-~-~-~ The really boring story about Dragons Fang MUD ~-~-~-~-~

Disclaimer: Really, we weren't planning on opening a mud at first.
            This was just a game that got further as we ran along.
            So don't kill anyone if you think it sux =)

Originally, there were three Swedish guys, Erik Soderberg, Stefan Lindstrom
and Fredrik Lannergren, who somewhere in the autumn of '95 thought of 
having a look at the Circle code and see just how difficult it was to
program it. 

Not that hard, it later turned out. After three months the basic outline for
a WoT style MUD saw the first light. But they weren't content with that, not
by far. They began to think that maybe, just maybe, the mud could become a
real one, with people playing on it and other people helping out.

And the story continues that way, gradually growing in complexity and size
until it has become what it is now. There is no end, and won't be either,
until someone accidentally types rm -rf / at the site.
