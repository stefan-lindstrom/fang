The True Power
  Bestowed only by the blessing of the Dark One, this tremendous
source of power, is given only to Shai'tan's most trusted servants.
Being a weapon which cuts both ways, this power is drawn directly
from the Great Lord, rather than Saidin or Saidir. Its advantages
allow the wielder to use this dark energy independent of the One
Power, still being able to channel the horrific blessing even if
the wielder is severed from Saidin or Saidir. Besides being
extremely lethal, the True Power extracts a price from the
wielder as well, driving him or her to madness and death, much as
the taint on Saidin. The Saa, black dots that appear in one's
eyes, is the only known physical indicator of oncoming insanity.
