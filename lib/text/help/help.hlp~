"WARD HUMAN"

&nUsage: weave 'ward human'
Duration: Instant
Basic mana cost: 500
Cost in trains: 6
Minimum levels: Air: 0  Earth: 0  Fire: 0  Spirit: 20  Water: 0
Effect:
This weave wards the rooms adjacent to yours, so that you will detect the
approach of any people nearby. If someone passes through the ward, you will get
the message "Something triggered your ward!" If the weave fails, you will not
get a message, nor will the mana cost be affected - it will look as if the weave
worked, only it didn't :)

#0
TRIP
&nTrip is an attack similar to bash or stun. The idea is to kick the legs
from under your opponent - causing them to fall on their butt. :)
The better your % in trip, the more chance of victory. However, there
are some animals that can't be tripped, and a failed trip lands -you-
on your backside instead.

As with almost any combat skill, after using trip, you cannot use it again
for a few rounds of combat.

PARRY DUCK SHIELDBLOCK DODGE

These skills are all automatic defense skills that take effect when attacked.
Depending on your skill, there is a chance that a \c01[Hit]\c00 will become a

BREAKSHIELD

Breakshield is a command available to all channeler and wilder class players.
Simply type 'breakshield' while shielded and you'll smash through - that is,
if you're strong enough. :) There is also a 'breakshield' spell/skill
available for channelers and wilders. It performs no differently to the command
breakshield, and costs 8 trains, so don't get it :)

IC
Any given character can either be IC or OOC at any given time. Type:
&rTOGGLE IC&n to switch to In Character mode. Now, you will be In Character
where you are on the MUD (you cannot claim to be Out of Character if someone
wishes to Roleplay with you in the room you are in). All your channeling is
considered to be IC - and if you overchannel, you burn out. Your taint, if
you are a male channeler, may increase with various results.

You can always switch to In Character mode simply by typing this command;
nothing can prevent you from Roleplaying whenever you feel like it.
&rTOGGLE IC&n again to switch to Out of Character mode. Now, you will be considered
to be Out of Character wherever you are. You may still burn out, and, of
course, channeling is still IC. On the other hand, you cannot see what
In Character people are saying or doing while in this mode.

OOC
Usage: ooc <message>

  OOC is the Out Of Character channel. All comments here are to remain as
such. Channels can be turned off and turned on again by typing TOGGLE OOC 
respectively.

#0
PIKER

Term used to describe those who are logging off the MUD.
Usually, there is no excuse for 'piking' - if they are
leaving for any reason, it is piking. Leaving for the most
trivial of reasons, such as work, food, or sleep, are the
most ridiculous cases - cases in which you should yell
"Piker!!" on every channel you can.

In extreme cases, one may use 'piker' to describe someone
that has not been on the MUD in a considerable amount of
time. These are the most obvious cases, but there are many
other types of piker that can only be learned over time.
#0
afw
  The AFW flag (Away From Window) is handy to use to show others
that you are not reachable. You can customise your AFW flag by typing :
  &rTOGGLE AFW <message>&n
For example, if my name is Kazhi and I wish to be AFW, I can give a
reason for being AFW. I would just type:
   &rTOGGLE AFW Kazhi is AFW Doing homework.&n
If you then telled Kazhi while he was AFK, the following messaage
would be displayed:
     Kazhi is AFW Doing homework.
     &rYou tell Kazhi,"Hiya!"&n
AFW can be turned off by typing TOGGLE AFW again.

chess
There is a game of chess in the game, which two players can use for their
amusement. The valid syntax and expected order of things is:
chess ask <opponent>    This makes you ask opponent if he wants to play chess.
chess accept <opponent>   This makes you accept a request to play. Now the game is on.
chess show      This shows the current board to you.
chess move <pos1> <pos2>    This makes you move a piece on pos1 to pos2.
...
...
chess resign        Makes you quit the game.

There are a few other things you can do, such as "chess move shortcastle" for
a short castling move, and "chess move longcastle" to make a long castling move.
The basics are in, such as not allowing movement that leaves your king in
a threatened position, and basic chess piece moves.
The one who asks is always white player, and the one who accepts is always black player.

You can also "chess pass" if you want to skip your turn.
If you want to watch someone elses game, type "chess watch <player>" to see the board.

DISGUISE GUILDDISGUISE
These commands allow you to disguise yourself.

Usages:
* "disguise <name>" will disguise you into someone else, 
   allowing you to set a new description, title and so on.
* "guilddisguise <guild name/num> <rank num> <subrank>"
   will add your disguised identity into a guild.

Some comments:
1) You can't guilddisguise into more than 1 exclusive 
   guild.
2) You can see all guilds' ranks using the "ranks <guild>"
   command.
3) Your darkfriend indentity will "pass" through the
   guilddisguising.
4) To undesguise use "disguise off".
#0
! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"

Examples:

  > tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.

  > ^rasmusse^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

  > ^you^you doing^
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

GUILD-SYSTEM
 
Our new guild system is quite extensive, and it has
many features. Those features allow better running
of the guilds, an overall flexibility and many        
tools to enhance the guild experience and RP.

First thing you should do is type "allguilds" to
see our guild list. You can then check the info on
each guild by typing "guildinfo <guild name/num>"
(like "guildinfo Aiel"). You can start seeking a
guild by typing "seekguild <guild name/num>", but
remember, you can only seek and be a part of 1
exclusive guild. This means you can join multiple
guilds, as long as only one of them is exclusive 
and your background "supports" it. In "guildinfo"
you'll also find other important information, like
who are the Guildleaders of a guild, a full
description of the guild, and the requirements
needed to be a part of the guild.
There are also "clubs" in the game to be used
for various functions not connected to your char's
IC life. Type "clubs" to see a list of them.
 
Once in a guild, you could use a lot of guild
feautures:                                  

* Guild channel: The guild channel name can be
found in "guildinfo", and you can use it like any
other channel (For example: "tt Hello guys."). You
can toggle it on/off using "toggle <channel name>"
and you can toggle the channel tag by using
"toggle tag-<channel name>" (For example:
"toggle tag-tt"). Channel tags are useful when
you have more than one guild channel on.
Notice that the gdt command still works.
It will "point" to your guild's channel if you're 
a GL, to your exclusive guild if you're not a GL 
and are a part of an exclusive guild, and to a
random guild you are a part of otherwise.

* Guild gossip: Most guilds have a guild gossip,
and you can find its name in "guildinfo". Type
the guild gossip name and read the latest plots
and gossip in the guild.

* Guild help: Use the "ghelp" command to see a    
list of all the guild help entries and read them.
"ghelp <guild name/id>" will show you a list of
all the ghelp entries in one of your guilds (For
example: "ghelp Aiel"), and "ghelp <guild> <entry>"
is used to read a specific entry (For example:
"ghelp Aiel Guild-Policy"). Check out the guild
help entries for guild policies and various info
important for the guildies to know.

* Guild recall: Use "recall <guild name/num>" to
recall to the guild's main room.

* Guild bank accounts: Using the gdeposit and 
gwithdraw commands.

These are only minor examples. Check out the 
help entries below for more information on all
the cool features :)

ADT AMT BDT CLUBTALK CTELL DT GDT MDT TT WT
All these commands have to do with "channels", groups of people communicating.

ADT is for people within a certain Ajah

ALIAS ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

ANSI COLOR

Usage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

See also: COLORSETTING
#0
APPLY

Usage: Apply (herbname) [target]

If you have a herb that you want to use, for example when you or someone else is 
low on hitpoints, you use this command.
If you don't type any other argument than the herb's name, it is presumed that 
you wish to apply the herb on yourself.
When applying the herb, it vanishes.
#0

ASSIST

Usage: ASSIST <person in need>

If Quifael is being beaten senseless by a warg and you feel brave enough

person you're assisting is fighting.

Usage: question <message>
       auction <message>

soon as you have had your name authorized. 

Examples:
auction short sword -- minimum bid 100k
question Hmm, how do I convert trains to practices?

These channels can be switched on or off with the TOGGLE command.
#0
BACKSTAB

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level.
The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab.  You can always backstab sleeping people.

Example: >backstab Otto

BASH

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned.  To bash someone
is to attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear. If you miss you lose
your balance and fall.

A bash makes you unable to bash again for 2-5 rounds of violence, depending on
how well your succeed (or fail :P)

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5 * damage.

BTELL BDISPLAY BSHOW BDELETE BREPLY

Tells are a good thing, but sometimes they are lost. When the receiver is 
fighting, or mailing/writing for instance. To deal with this problem, tells
received in these situations are buffered. Up to 20 tells can be buffered
at one time. If you have tells in your buffer a (B) will occur at your 
prompt. Use bdisplay to see how many tells you have, and from  whom. 

Ex: 
 > (B) bdispl
Tell [ 0]: from Atriau
Tell [ 1]: from Sorilea

etc...

To read a certain buffered tell, use bshow. 

Usage: bshow <number>
Ex: 
> (B) bshow 1
Sorilea told you: Hi, wassup?

To reply to a buffered tell, use breply. 

Usage: breply <number> <your reply>

Ex:
> (B) breply 1 Nothing much, and you?
You tell Sorilea 'Nothing much, and you?'

Last, to delete a buffered tell, use bdelete:

Usage: bdelete <number>

Ex: 
> (B) bdelete 1

etc..) you can use this command for an easy travel there. 

See also: SPEEDWALK
#0
CEMOTE

Usage: cemote <same sex>|<opposite sex>|<nonchans>

This is a special variant of emote that only channelers can use.
It's intended use is to emote channeling, hence the name.
Since people see things differently depending on their gender and
ability to channel, the emote has to be split three ways:
* One for channelers of the same sex
* One for channelers of the opposite sex
* One for people who cannot channel.
The separator between those three parts is a tilde (|).

The first part is what channelers of the same sex see when the actor is
cemoting. That works just like an ordinary emote, with name first.
The two others however, are echoed "as is" without any name, since 
people who can't see the flows can't know who's responsible for what
happens due to them...Let's take an example:

cemote smiles as he sets Reorx beard on fire with Fire and Spirit|Your
skin itches as Reorx beard suddenly catches fire! Foul play!|All of a
sudden, Reorx beard self ignites!

Channelers of the same sex then see:
\c02Fredrik smiles as he sets Reorx beard on fire with Fire and Spirit\c00
and channelers of the opposite sex see:
\c02Your skin itches as Reorx beard suddenly catches fire!Foul play!\c00
and all the rest see:
\c02All of a sudden, Reorx beard self ignites!\c00

Play with it to see what you can use it for, it's not that apparent at
first glance.

CRAFT

This command is only available to those who have the Craft skill.

By typing this, you enter a menu in which you can create items of
your own choosing. You select what to change by typing the number
before the ).

Here's a brief explanation of each possible choice:
\c011\c00) Keywords. Keywords are what the game looks for when you type get
drop, wield,etc...Set this to something that is typical for this item.
The keywords are to be separated by a whitespace, so multiword keywords
don't work
For example: A two-handed sword should have keywords "blade sword two-hand"

\c012\c00) Short description. That is what is shown when you manipulate
the item. For instance "Otto wields a two-handed sword." Here "a
two-handed sword" is the short description.

\c013\c00) Description is what you see when item is listed in the room contents.
Example: A two-handed sword, slightly rusty form disuse, lies here.

\c014\c00) Type. Select what kind of item you want to create. A list of
all possible choices will appear for you to choose from.

\c015\c00) Wear flags. This lets you choose where the item is supposedly
worn. You can choose several different locations, and a list of all
possible choices is shown. \c01Note:\c00 Always keep the \c02TAKE\c00 flag,
or noone will ever be able to pick it up if you drop it.

\c016\c00) Affection when worn: Here you can determine what nice affections
the item should give to you when it's worn. The more affections you choose,
the higher the total cost to craft this item. You can have 6 affections 
maximum, and each must be unique.
The \c02costs\c00 for these affections are: 
500 per step for a base stat such as Strength, Charisma, Constitution and so forth, 
400 per step for hitroll and damroll,
50 per step for AC and Abs, 
10 per step for mana, move and hitpoints.
You can never have the item to cost more than \c025000\c00 coins total.

\c017\c00) The title of this one depends on the type of object you've
chosen.
Don't forget to set the stats here either, or your item may well be useless.
Here you set such things as how long a light source has to burn, damage
of weapons, abs and ac of armor and so forth.
Note that the item costs more the higher stats you have here.
For instance, weapon damage cost is 100*number of damage dice*size of
damage dice, and so forth.
\c018\c00) Exit and create object. If you're satisfied with the object,
type this to pay the cost, get the item and return to the normal game.
\c019\c00) Exit without creating object. If you changed your mind and
don't want to create the object, type this number.

DICE

This is a fairly complex command that is used for selecting person to play with, set
the amount to be diced about, and finally to roll the dice.
The way it is performed is the following:

Dice <playername>

This selects the player you want to play with. The person has to be in the room.
If someone wants to dice with you and has typed this, you respond by typing

Dice <asking player's name>

Then you have confirmed that you two want to play dice.
After that, you have to set an amount to play about. This is done with the 
following command:

Dice <amount>

This makes one player set the amount he wants to play dice about. If you
accept his bet, you type the same. Otherwise, just walk away. *grin*
Then you play, by just typing

Dice

This rolls the dice and shows the results. The loser then automatically
loses the amount agreed upon, and the money is transferred to the winner.
After this, you can either decide to play again, by typing

Dice <amount>

which repeats the betting and dicing procedure, or by typing

Dice off

The last command stops the playing.

"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)

you can be found by someone using the "locate" skill. If located, your name
will not be displayed, but it won't be long before the person notices someone

Generally, most actions will un-hide you, although there are exceptions, mainly
informative commands like who, score and so forth. As a rule of thumb, if the
command sounds like it involves movement, you will unhide.
Once you have made a successful attempt at hiding, a (h) will appear in front
of your prompt.
Example:

  > hide
  Ok.
  > (h) (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

MAINTAIN

When maintaining a weave, each tick, the MUD will go through all the weaves
and when encountering one of yours, an ammount of mana will be deducted for 
the maintaining. In exchange, the duration of the weave will not lessen that
tick. 

The ammount of mana deducted each tick will be displayed to you, but can be 
calculated like this. (base-mana+mana_add)/duration.

If you go to sleep, quit the game, release the One/True power or if you
get killed ALL your maintained weaves will unravel. 

A tied weave will have a set duration. No additional mana will be deducted, 
but once the duration is ended, the weave will unravel. 

Tie is a command that'll allow you to tie off a maintained weave. 
Unknot will untie a tied weave, and you'll start to maintain it instead.
Unravel will 'destroy' a weave, whether it's tied or maintained. (Maintained 
weaves will be harder to unravel though.) If you try to unravel a weave that
you yourself has woven, you will automagically succeed. 

Syntax:
  tie 'armor' kilmor 
     Will tie the armor weave you've woven earlier on Kilmor
  unknot 'infravision'
     Will unknot the weave infravision, and since no target is given, it'll

SAVE

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary

but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.
#0
SAY OSAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT '

Usage: osay | shout <string>
       tell | whisper | ask <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either osay, tell, whisper or shout.

If you frequent MUDs, you are probably used to using 'say' to talk.
Here at Dragon's Fang, however, the standard way to talk is with
'Osay' (&WO&nut of character &Wsay&n). Say is reserved for roleplay.

Examples:

&n  > osay Hey, does anyone know how to get to Emond's Field?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use , as shorthand for Osay, or ' for say.

&n  > , hello there

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health more
quickly.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep.
You can awaken yourself with the WAKE command. The SLEEP command can also be
used with furniture , as in "sleep bed" (a more general description of the

only those in the same guild) an increase in the flow you teach. 
After you've taught, you have to wait a while until you can teach again,
and a student can only be taught 15 times.

TIE

If you have already woven a weave, and are maintaining it, you might 
wish to tie it of, in order to save mana. This is what tie allows you
to do. 
Remeber though, you can ONLY Tie weaves you yourself has woven.

Syntax: 
        tie 'weave' <target|room>

If no target is given, Tie will assume you wish to tie the particular
weave on yourself.

Examples:
       tie 'armor'
    Will try to locate, and tie an armor-weave on you.  

       tie `shield' lanfear
    Will try to locate a shield=weave on lanfear, that you are maintaining, 
    and if found, tie it off. 

       tie 'Dome of Air' room
    Will try to locate a Dome of Air in the room you're in and tie it off.
#0
TIEWEAVE

Tieweave works almost exactly like weave, with one main difference. Weave
will maintain weaves, thus costing you mana each tick for all the weaves
you're maintaining, while tieweave will tie your weave off, thus giving your 
weave a limited existance. Weaving none-tiable weaves with tieweave works very
well, i.e. they're more or less transparent. 

Syntax: 
        tieweave `weave` <target> <mana_add>

Examples:
        tieweave 'armor'
        tieweave 'shield' Mazrim

See also: WEAVE, MAINTAIN, TIE, UNKNOT, UNRAVEL
#0
TIME

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll

particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#0
TINFO

Usage: tinfo <object>

Will display info about a Ter'angreal (given that object indeed is a 
Ter'angreal), such as which weave will be woven, at what lvl, mana add,

when using the Ter'angreal. 

Note: There's a 3% chance of burning out if failing!

See also: USE TTEST
#0

TOGGLE

Usage: toggle
       toggle <toggle>
       toggle afk|afw <optional message>

Most of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e. they are
saved when you quit. The exception to this is AFK and AFW messages.

TOGGLE followed by a toggle name will toggle that toggle.

Afk and afw may have an optional message that will be sent to people trying 
to TELL you. If not set, the standard messages will be shown.

UNRAVEL

Unravel will try to 'destroy' a weave woven on a char (including yourself).
If you are the weaver, you will automagicall succeed to Unravel the weave, 
and at no mana-cost at all. If another player has woven the weave you want
to unravel, the difficulty will be different depending on if the weave is 
maintained, the mana_add the weaver has put into the weave, the Power the
weave is woven with (I.e harder to unravel a weave woven with Saidin, if
you yourself is wielding Saidar).

Although, unravel as tied off weave, woven with the same power as you
yourself wield, you will always have a chance between 10-100% of success. 
And your mana will never go below 50).

If the weave is maintained, it will cost double amount of mana, and reduce
the chans of succes with half, to unravel. 

If the weave is woven with the 'wrong' Power, it will once again reduce the 
chans of success with 50%. 

So, trying to unravel a maintained weave, woven with the 'wrong' Power
will cost yuo double as much mana as a tied of weave, and your chans
of success will be between 2-25%.

If target is omitted, unravel will autotarget on you. 

Syntax:
   unravel 'weave' <target|room>

Examples:
   unravel 'wrap' 
 Will try to unravel the first wrap-weave found on yourself.

   unravel 'shield' Mazrim
 Will try to unravel the first shield-weave found on Mazrim

   unravel 'Dome of Air' room
 Will try to unravel the dome of air-weave in your present location.

UPTIME

Usage: uptime

This command simple tells you how long the mud has been running since the 
last reboot/crash.
#0
USE

Usage: use <argument(s)>

Using a Ter'angreal is done in two steps:

1) make sure you're holding the Ter'angreal. 
2) use the USE command together with arguments the Ter'angreal requires. 

For instance, a Ter'angreal containing a Travel weave, will need a
roomname as argument, either the new or the old syntax:

  (old)use Caemlyn 
  (new)use 'Caemlyn Pigeon Courier'

A Ter'angreal weaving offensive weaves, or weaves like heal, shield will
require a character name as argument. If the weave can be applied to yourself, 
no argument will be nescessary.

VALUE

Usage: value <item>

Before selling an item to a shop, you can ask the shopkeeper how much
he or she is willing to pay for it.
 
Example:

#0
WASH

Usage: wash

This command is rather handy, should you have the misfortune to
be dirt kicked in combat. If you have a nonempty water container in
your inventory, you use some water to wash the dirt from your eyes,
restoring your vision. You can't use this command in combat, duh :p

See also: DIRTKICK
#0
VISIBLE

Usage: visible

Use this command to break your weave of invisibility before it expires.
It also allows you to remove a Warder fancloth cloak, or come out of
hiding.

See also: INVISIBILITY

WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

For changing your position.  If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea
to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap.

You can also use the "sleep/rest/sit <object>" commands with furniture
around the MUD , as in "sit chair" , "rest sofa" or "sleep bed".
#0
WEAR

Usage: wear <item> [location]

If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing 
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

Examples:

  > wear boots
  > wear all.bronze
  > wear all
  > wear ring finger

WEATHER

Usage: weather

WEAVE CAST

Usage: weave 'weave name' 
       weave 'weave name' <mana add>
       weave 'weave name' <target>
       weave 'weave name' <target> <mana add>
       
This is the command to use spells, or "weaves" as they are called in
Dragons Fang Mud. In order to be able to use the weaves, you must have
learned Grasp, Release and the particular weave you want to use.
Once that is done, you type one of the above mentioned syntaxes,
depending on whether the weave needs a target mentioned or not. The 
<mana add> is how much (if any) -extra- mana you want to spend on the
weave to increase its performance. Exactly what that increase is for
the particular weave is described individually for each weave.
Remember, though, that the total mana used in a weave always is the 
"Basic Mana cost" mentioned in the help entry for the weave PLUS the
<mana add>. 
The mana added is oftmost mentioned in the specific weave help entries
as "add".

about classes, type: HELP CLASSES.

You can also chose from what part of our realm you wish to be
and to get a list of those parts, type: HELP RACES.

CABILITIES

  To define your characters abilities, or lack of abilites
there are certain values that defines your Strength, 
Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
Moves, Mana and Hitpoints(HP).

  Strength     - With a high strength, your character can  carry more
                 equipment, and give more damage in battle.
                      
  Constitution - With a high constitution your character   will gain
                 more Hitpoints every time you gain a level.

  Dexterity    - With a high dexterity, your character will be more
                 agile, i.e will have a higher chance to   avoid being
                 hit by an enemy.

  Intelligence - With a high intelligence, your character have a higher
                 chance to get more practice, which are used to learn skills.
                 Learning will also be easier for the intelligent character.

  Wisdom       - With a high wisdom, your character will have a higher chance
                 to gain 'trains' (See HELP POWER). 
                 
                      
  Charisma     - With high charisma, your character will gain lower prices
                 in shops, .i.e the perfect ability for the greedy. :)

  Moves        - Moves are used to move around the realm. Every move in a direcrtion\
                 will cost you moves. When your moves are 0, you'll have to rest before
                 continuing your travels.
                      
  Mana         - Mana is used for weaving the One Power. The more Mana, more powerful
                 weaves your character will be able to use.
     
  Hitpoints    - This is the amount of beating up your character will be able to take
                 before he/she dies. The more Hitpoints, the tougher, hard-hitting mobs
                 he/she will be able to fight

  To increase one of the abilities, just type the ability name, and the value you wish it
to have. I.e to get Strength 25, just type Strength 25. If you wish to lower your abilities
to gain more trains, just type (for example) Strength 5, which will give you some extra
trains.

  The cost for increasing a ability is raising with raised ability as this:


   0 - 18 -> 1 train/step
   19-25 -> 2 trains/step  
   26-39 -> 3 trains/step 

  To raise your Moves, Hitpoints or Mana, type the ability and the level you wish to have, 
for instance: Mana 110 will raise your mana from to 110.  

  You can, as with the other abilities lower your level. Mana/Moves/Hitpoints ALL costs 1 
train/10 steps, despite what your level you already have.

CPOWERS

  If you're a channeler/wisdom OR have the Spark inborn you will
have characteristics describing your strength in the Five Powers
(i.e Air, Water, Spirit, Fire and Earth). You will also be able
to spend the trains you gain as you advance in levels to increase your
strength.

  Your strength in the Five Powers will determine what
weaves your character can weave. I.e Level doesn't matter in this case.
#0
CCLASSES

With the CLASS-command you can change the class of
of your character. Just type CLASS <class-name>. The
following classes are available:

  Adventurer - An average class. Mostly a fighting-class,
               but also some knowledge about healing herbs,
               and some woodsman-skills
                  
  Soldier    - A fighting-class. Lot's of knowledge about
               different weapons, and other fighting-skills and
               not so very much more.

  Craftsman  - Knows how to work with your hands, like repearing
               stuff, and tooling it (re-stringing). Some knowledge
               about fighting, but not much.

  Thief      - Knows a lot about hiding, sneaking, stealing and to
               recognize other thieves (i.e finding their hiding-spots
               and similar). Knows some basic fighting skills too, and
               most important of all, knows how to backstab! :)

  Wisdom     - The average willage-wisdom. Lot's of knowledge about
               herbs and other healing-skills. Most often NOT a channeler
               only a person devoting his/her life as a healer, and
               as a master of herb-lore. Of course a wisdom has some knowledge\
               of fighting too.
           
  Wilder     - A person able to channel, but a person that differs from the
               channeler-class as one that has tought her/him-self to channel
               avoiding the 3/4-chance to die doing so. A wilder don't know as
               many weaves as the channeler does, although the wilders weaves
               are often more powerful that those of a channeler. Can learn about
               the same fighting-skills that an adventurer, although later in life\
               and at a higher cost.

  Channeler  - A person that have been tought have to channel, i.e  someone has
               guided the character through the critical parts of learning.
               A channeler knows more weaves than the wilder, although often
               not as powerful ones. Like the wilder, the channeler can learn
               most of the fighting-skills that an adventurer can, but later in
               life, and at a higher cost.

CRACES

  Persons from different parts of the realm, has different
characteristics. As an example, a person from Shienar
might be (in average) stronger than a person from Illian.
But the Illianer might be smarter than the Shienaran.


  In Dragons Fang we've made those differences as modificatuions,
i.e. with a +3 modifier for strength, you start out with 
strength 14 instead of strength 11. So, you'll save a few
points trying to increase your strength to max. (Max will always
be 30, despite your bonuses. Another thing with races is, with the
HOME-command, yoy'll be transfered to your hometown, i.e a Shienaran
will be tranfered to Fal Dara, and a Andorian will be sent to Caemlyn.

Below are a list of 'races' and their bonuses:

primary_talent

A Primary Inborn Talent is a special ability that has been approved 
for your RP by the Storymaster. Usually, gaining such a Talent is 
as simple as sending him or her a tell, and explaining what Talent 
you want. If there's a reason why that Talent isn't acceptable, 
you will typically be told what it is, and offered suggestions 
on something else to try instead. Primary Inborn Talents can be either 
Channeling or Non-Channeling in nature; there are more Channeling-oriented 
Talents because there are more unusual things that can be done with the 
Power than there are things which can be done without it. You may have 
one Primary Inborn Talent at a time.

For further help, see: help talent_board, help secondary_talent, 
help talentlist, and help special_skills.

secondary_talent

A Secondary Inborn Talent is a special ability that has been approved for 
your RP by the Storymaster. To be set with one, you must apply to the
Storymaster, and submit a log of RP as is detailed in HELP TALENT_BOARD. 
Upon satisfactory completion of the instructions found therein, you will be 
set with the requested Talent, or, should the Storymaster raise an objection 
relating to the balance of the MUD or some other such matter, offered the 
opportunity to choose something else and be set with that.

For further help, see: help talent_board, help primary_talent, help talentlist, 
and help special_skills.

special_skills

A Special Skill is just what its name says - a special skill. More particularly, 
it is a skill which is only obtainable through RP with someone who already 
possesses the skill, and with the Storymaster's approval. Some Special Skills 
are also mirrored by code skills and weaves; these code abilities can be learned 
only if the Special Skill is set by the Storymaster - without a setting, the 
code ability will not function. The majority of cases can be settled by a simple 
tell to the Storymaster, but if there is an unusual circumstance, verification 
of the skill may be requested, in the form of a log of RP, the agreement of the 
teacher of the skill, or a request from a Guildleader. &RNOTE: If you die ICly, 
you will undergo a removal of any special skills which are not part of the 
standard curriculum in whatever guild you are guilded. For instance, if you are 
an Asha'man and were taught how to Travel, you would retain that special skill. 
If you were an Asha'man who was taught balefire, you would not.&n

Talent_board

Any channeling character may approach the Storymaster and request that a 
particular Inborn Talent from the help inborn helpfile should be set onto 
himself or herself. At the present time, only one inborn Talent may be selected 
in this manner. This single inborn Talent represents the character's outstanding 
area of expertise with the One Power, be it Healing, constructing Wardings or 
Illusions, or what have you. There is a procedure by which one may gain 
additional Talents, however, though these Talents are secondary in nature and 
will not justify roleplaying the same degree of skill. The procedure shall be as 
follows:

1. A Talent Board, composed of two guildleaders (drawn randomly from the Asha'man, 
Aes Sedai (Rebel and Tower), Darkfriend, Kin, and Seanchan guilds) and of two 
morts (also randomly selected from the same guilds, with each guild having one 
potential representative appointed by its guildleader) will be convened by the 
Storymaster on a fairly regular basis, perhaps every two months or so.

2. Those individuals seeking to gain a secondary or tertiary Talent must send the 
Storymaster at least one cleaned log of RP that they feel is representative of 
their ability to RP in the field in which they wish to gain the Talent (that is, 
don't send a swordplay spar if you want to be set up with Cloud Dancing). The 
Storymaster will remove the applicants' names from the logs, replacing them with 
an alias, and then submit the logs to the Talent Board for review. Thus, the 
procedure is double-blind - the judges don't know who they're judging, and the 
applicants don't know who is judging them.

3. The sitting Talent Board will score the applicants' logged RP on a scale of one 
to ten, in the following categories: Clarity (ease of understanding what is being 
done), Creativity (how unique and innovative it is), Bookishness (whether it could 
actually be done in the books, judging by what is known about the rules that govern 
channeling), Aesthetics (how it looks), and Judge's Discretion (how the judge 
-feels- about the RP). They will send the Storymaster their scores, and the total 
score for each applicant will be averaged.

4. Those applicants who score at least an average of 7.5 will be awarded the Talent 
they've requested. A lower score will result in the rejection of the request. Note: 
This criterion is applicable -only- to a secondary Talent grant. For a third Talent, 
the required average will jump considerably, to an average score of 8.75.

The Storymaster also retains the power to veto any and all awardings made by the 
Talent Board, if he or she feels that such an action is needful for the purposes 
of ensuring balance in the MUD's RP.

The choice of the Talent requested, however, is up to the applicant. If someone 
wishes to signify an extreme degree of specialization in a particular Talent, it is 
also permissible to choose a secondary Talent that matches the first - for example, 
someone with Affinity for Healing as a Primary Inborn Talent is free to choose 
Affinity for Healing as a secondary Talent, if he or she so desires. Possession of 
multiple Talents in the same field signifies high specialization in that area, and 
correspondingly high natural ability.

Finally, it must be stressed that this Talent Board does NOT function as a contest. 
Each applicant is judged and scored solely in respect to his or her RP ability, and 
for the sole purpose of determining if he or she can be deemed knowledgeable enough 
to roleplay an unusually powerful character. The results will be kept confidential. 
An applicant's score will be given out -only- to the applicant. Failure to gain a 
requested Talent does not disqualify an applicant from later attempts to do so. 
There is a MAXIMUM Talent Cap of three Talents. There will be no exceptions. Do not 
even ask.

and help special_skills.

questing
  In hopes of assisting smaller roleplay plots on the mud, rather than
skipping right to the major stuff then stopping after the massive event, the
following has been implemented.

1) If you wish to run an event, contact your  Guildleader or a Storyteller.
In the case of the latter, it is their job to execute events for your
enjoyment and if you suggest an event to them, they will seriously consider
the idea and run it, or explain why they wouldn't and help you come up with
a better idea or plot.

2) You must have more than three individuals involved in the event. Mail
the names along with the idea to the Storyteller you've chosen to run the
event.

3) Outline what you would like the Storyteller to do in the event.
  What role did you want the Storyteller to play?
  How much authority do you want the Storyteller to have oocly?
  Do you want the Storyteller to run the event, so that you are as surprised
as your companions at the outcome of the rp? Or would you rather have
full control of the event and put the Storyteller in a role of conflict
with your own or a subordinate position to your character for the rp.


  The Storytellers are here to assist in your roleplaying experience.
They are required to run events for your pleasure, but this does not mean
that they will not take quest requests. Please help the Storytellers, come up
with events that will make you have fun at Dragon's Fang.

gossips and rumors
Syntax: gossip 

  This skill, given only to the Entertainers allows you to post up ic
rumors that others may have heard or observed. While the Entertainers are
the ones with access to the skill, everyone should be encouraged to
utilize their abilities in posting these rumors. Say for example, you want
to have something spread throughout the city. You're willing to perform a
shady job, or you're looking to hire some folks on for some project you've
thought of running. Maybe even you're looking for information as too a
death of a friend and you spread that you've got gold to spend and an
attentive ear to use if anyone has the information you are seeking.
  This system is great for rp so please, utilize your local Entertainer
and get them to spread a rumor for you. 

  One last note. If you cannot find an entertainer to give a rumor too, mail them and if they deem it appropriate, it'll get posted.

rp_tooledeq

Advanced Topics:

   There are many aspects of Roleplay to become a part of, and once
you feel comfortable with simply expressing yourself through words,
you can create a more in-depth environment around yourself. There are
several ways to do this, we've only touched on a few here.

A. Tooled Equipment

   To create a more complete character, many players decide to get the
equipment that they wear tooled into something more appropriate and IC
for their character. They go about this in an IC way, finding a
craftsman skilled in whatever they need to have altered. Once finding
a craftsman, the player usually RP's that they've torn a hem, or that
they want something new to wear. The craftsman is almost always more
than willing to roleplay this out, this is the concept for their
character after all. In the Roleplay, you can send tells to the
craftsman on how you want your tooled equipment to look like, it
usually coincides very closely with your description. For instance, if
you've put that you're wearing a silken blue gown in your description,
you might want to have the equipment you are wearing on your body
tooled into a luxurious, silken blue gown that hugs the curves. Or
something like that. You can add color to the equipment this way too.
A suggestion though, try to keep the descriptions for the new
equipment to one line so it does not wrap, it looks cleaner that way.
This is only a suggestion, some people like long item names, this is
only the opinion of the writer of this document.

rp_npcs

B.Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

   Often Npcs enhance your rp. Incorporating them into your own emotes
can be not only entertaining, but a lot more realistic. If you're
playing a soldier in the Whitecloaks', unless that soldier has been
given leave from his post or he's snuck out of camp while off-duty, he
will not be alone. Other rpers should respect the NPCs being emoted
and treat them as they would treat the PC (Player Character) itself.
On the same token however, the rper with command over the few
Whitecloaks' with him, should be responsible as well. Do not abuse
the privilege given to you and go about, horribly slaying the
citizenry. Again, a common sense issue.
#0
rp_relatives

C. Relatives

   Another way to create a more in-depth environment is to work out
other players to be relatives of yours. It is a lot of fun and creates
a ton of interesting Roleplay. You should be careful though to work
out the history of your characters together so that you can incorporate
each other into your backgrounds appropriately. Come up with
interesting little snippets of things that have happened in the past,
everyone has a story or two about a relative... right? Create a
relationship that you both agree on. Do you guys hate each other? Are
you the best of friends? Does your younger sibling annoy you? Do you
hate your father? Those types of things make roleplaying with the other
player much more interesting. Just make sure that you work all this
out beforehand, it's not nice to spring something new on your relative.
#0
rp_rooms

D. Rooms/Houses

   Having a general room an inn is nice for awhile, but, some
characters like to expand upon that and actually have personalized
rooms and/or houses. Most Guilds offer a room for your character at
some stage, and you can simply send in a description that is
personalized to your character. Having a personalized space for your
character can tell your roleplay partners much about yourself,
especially with what is located in the description with items and
things. It is also a place where you can tell other Characters ICly
that they can find you, or leave you notes. This way, you can set up
interesting scenario's with someone, even if you rarely see them on at
the same time, you can roleplay via mail. If you wish to add something
more elaborate than a room, simply contact the Head Builder and the
Weaver with your request and a description of what are intending and
they will respond to you promptly.
#0
rp_jobs

E. Jobs

   A very good way to create both more Roleplay for your Character, as
well as substance, is to get a job IC'ly. Finding a noble, or a
merchant, or someone who needs a sword for hire is a good way to
establish yourself in circles about the mud. Just be careful to not
limit yourself to only RP'ing with that one person. It can be extremely
boring if they're not around much. Keeping yourself as open as possible
allows you to Roleplay with whomever comes your way. For instance, if
you get a job as a servant Noble, you're not serving 24/7, you are
allowed to have days off, or even be on errands for your Lord or Lady.
Use your imagination, it's free!

rp_etiquette

Tips and Advice:

A. Roleplay Etiquette and Advice

   There are many rules of thumb, mostly unspoken ones, that
roleplayers generally follow. They will be elaborated on below, but
one warning, this is not a roleplay bible. This document is only as
informed as the person who writes it. Regardless, to the etiquette
and enough of my blathering.

1) Actions in an Emote: Although it is possible to execute more than
one action per emote, it would be advisable not to do this overmuch.
Think about the people you're rping with, put yourselves in their
shoes. If someone types out an eight line emote, which describes his
character having leaped multiple tall buildings at a single bound,
killed the Dark One and swam across the Aryth ocean, they're probably
not going to be looked upon favorably by their peers. This does not
mean that you should do numerous one line emotes which accomplish the
same task, it means, give your rp  partners an opportunity to respond
to your emote before you continue on in your rp. A general rule
to gauge such is allow everyone you are rping with to emote, before
you emote once more. You do not need to follow this rule in every
occasion. Say for example, you're having a conversation with someone
and whoever else is in the room, isn't doing anything to involve
his/herself in your rp, ignore them until they do involve themselves.
Just use common sense and courtesy when rping.

2) Closed Emotes or Actions: One of the major pet peeves for any
experienced rper, is someone who executes a closed emote.

  "George walks up to you and breaks your nose with a vicious blow to
   your face. Laughing, he leans over your prone body and spits in
   your face. 'Take that Darkfriend', he sneers derisively."

   This is a perfect example of a closed emote. You do not know if you
can break the guy's nose. You're taking away your opponent's ability
to respond to your action. Here's an improvement and what George should
do.

  "George growls deep in his chest, those chilly blue eyes flashing
   dangerously, before he steps nearer you, his balled fist whistling
   forward in an attempt to shatter your nose and send you sprawling
   to the ground."

   Leave your actions open for a response by your opponent. Sure, on
occasion, you're going to be faced with some goofball who thinks he
can avoid your blows, sidestep projectile weapons with ease, smoke
three Blademasters without breaking a sweat. Ignoring these people
would be advisable. Try and explain to them that they should respect
your wishes in rp and that their action is inappropriate for the scene
and if they don't listen, avoid them for a time until they learn how
to rp properly.

3) Supermen : There are few things more irritating on a rp game, than
someone, as mentioned above, who thinks he/she can blithely ignore your
actions or can simply set them aside without disturbing a hair. Please
avoid doing this. If someone executes a realistic action, respond with
a realistic action of your own. If someone steps up to you and tries
to lop your head off with his sword, respond by meeting the attack,
rather than leaping back ten feet so that the blow whistles through
the air where your body was four seconds ago and then leaping forward
through that space again and exploiting some weakness. Always keep in
mind that people are constantly moving. Because we aren't using true
VR technology for our game, we must rely upon our individual typing
speeds. As 1 and 2 touched on previously, be respectful of your fellow
rpers, respect their actions and respond to them accordingly and
realistically, not foolishly.

4) Realism: This is not so much necessary to know of before you begin
rping, but it will gain you more rp because you're 'with it' when you
rp. There are several types of realism we can address,  such as realism
by giving your character a personality that is not perfect, realism by
acknowledging the fact that it takes time to get anywhere, realism by
knowing your character is not Hercules and can not lift an entire
building. I know it is a difficult concept to think of 'realistic' RP
in a game based off of a book created by  some author, but, we're
assuming that most of the laws of our world are similar there (ie.
gravity does exist, a person is only so strong, a horse can only
travel so fast). When RP concerns magic such as the One Power, then
it is 'realistic' according to the laws that Robert Jordan made up
through writing his books (ie. male channelers can not grasp Saidar,
female channelers can not sense the spark in male channelers or see
them holding Saidin, not everyone is skilled in healing like the Kin
or the Yellow Ajah, and more).

   The personality of your character and realism. It is not wise to
rp a character who is drop dead gorgeous or handsome, with money coming
out of their ears, the intelligence to rival the best scholars, and
knowledge and cunning to defeat a Forsaken. Please roleplay your
character with flaws. We all have our shortcomings and our problems.
One of those old human truisms, no one's perfect, should be held to
like gospel when you're rping. If you're gorgeous, be not particularly
the brightest bulb in the box. If you're utterly smart, be an uncouth
bastard who doesn't have an incredibly high ability in social
interaction with others. If you're a scholar and know things no one
else does, like about the Forsaken or have some sort of secret dredged
up from some forgotten library, be arrogant and recluse. If you're
Mr. Moneybags, be condescending and superior in your power.

   At this point, some may say, well my character is just not like any
of that and that is probably true. Illustrated above is a guideline to
remember when one is thinking about making a character. You may be rich
but have spent the majority of your life learning humility from having
worked along side your common man. This is all possible, but you need
to remember that without a powerful influence coming into your
character's life to change their attitude, usually when they're outstanding 
at one thing, they'll have a horrible draw back in another.

   Balance is the name of the game. Be balanced and realistic with your
characters and not only will people enjoy rping with you and therefore
give you more rp, you will have more fun. Contrary to popular belief,
it's rather entertaining rping a flawed character.

   I'll digress a moment to speak of Rand. He's largely an untrusting
boy thrust into the shoes of a man who once ruled the majority of the
world and who, for 500 years, was acknowledged the preeminent power in
the Age of Legends. This has a profound effect on Rand. Not only does
he fall into the unwise trap of being arrogant in his power and
knowledge, he's stubborn and unyielding, unwilling to listen to other
points of view. He will need to pay the price for his folly and that
will create rp for his player and for those around him. Really, book
characters are just examples for people to follow or take knowledge
from. If you look at the various  personalities outlined in the novels,
it's a rare thing to find  someone who is perfectly balanced
perfection. Remember that when you rp and try it, it's quite
interesting to act out.

rp_where

B. Where to find Roleplay

   Finding constant rp on any Mud, can be somewhat difficult. Some may
merely be idling or talking with friends or killing mobs (the non
player character mobiles in the game), but for those who wish to find
RP, there are a few tactics you can employ.

1) The majority of the rp that occurs on Fang, centers, at the moment
anyway, around the Andoran city of Caemlyn. The social center of
Caemlyn is the Oval Plaza, down, north and west from where you enter
from character creation. This Plaza often has RP occurring in it, from
merely idle IC chatter with others, to conflicts between the various
guilds that populate our game. If you wish to find rp, this is one of
the places you would want to start looking.

2) The various guilds have guild areas where the majority of their rp
occurs. For example, in the Rebel camp, the vast amount of RP that
occurs in the Rebel Sedai and Warders, is in Salidar, a small town in
Altara where they have made their stronghold. The White Tower, who
believe themselves to be the true Aes Sedai and the true movers and
shakers of the world's events, has a great deal of their RP occur in
Tar Valon. This is not to say that these are the only places one may rp
with Aes Sedai and Warders. In fact, many of these travel to Caemlyn
and the other populated cities we have built, to find different RP.
Thus these diverse groups, manage to intermingle with the mud as a
whole, both ICly and OOCly.

3) Caemlyn has quite a few hot spots of RP. The common rooms of the
various inns (such as the Half Moon Inn or the Golden Bowl), the
courtyards, the palace, the Andoran Manor are just a few spots to
mention. All one needs to do is seek out people in these populated
areas, connect with other characters ICly and OOCly, and move on from
there.

rp_setup

C. How to set up Roleplay

   Setting up rp can be one of the most beneficial things you'll ever
learn on a mud. Finding people or setting up events through OOC
methods, often will net you a great deal of RP in both the areas of
expanding your experiences with the various guilds and giving your
character more depth, moings to talk about, in short, events and people
and IC happenings that occur, help to fill out the personality that
you've outlined in character generation.

1) Using Storytellers and Guildleaders: The Guildleaders (GLs) of
Dragon's Fang have all been selected for their abilities with creating
rp, being patient with people new to the game, solving disputes with
their guildees and with the people on the mud as a whole and finally,
for their common sense and down-to-earth attitudes. Sure, sometimes
you'll encounter the occasional bad apple, we can't all be perfect, but
for the most part, the Guildleaders and Storytellers (STs) we have on
Fang, are there for the express purpose of assisting you in having a
better rping experience. The GLs are people you can go to when you need
help setting up  RP. Lets say for the sake of argument, that you're
getting bored with the repetition, the same old, same old RP scene and
you want to find something new. Your GL is your contact. Go to them
with a suggestion for an event they can run or a scene they can set
up for you. Immortals aren't just immortals because they have the
skills above, they're there to use their skills. Ask them to help you
put something together and spark RP in your particular guild.

   Beyond the various GLs though, are your Storytellers. These people
are immed because they've proven to the Storyguide, the head of the
department, that they know how to RP, know how to set up a quick,
relaxing scene of RP,ultimately, know how to craft long-running plot, a
series of interconnected events which allows for the creation of
RP for a significant amount of time. Again, just like the GLs, the STs
are there to help you make your time on Fang enjoyable. However, if you
aren't enjoying the string of scenes a Storyteller offers, because you
either just don't like it or it doesn't really suit you, you are more
than welcome to ask for something specifically for you and your
friends.

   If there's something you especially want, tell us. Don't be shy
about it. The GLs and STs work closely together, in an attempt to bring
you a fun RPing environment, but you can help us by telling us and
suggesting to us, events, scenes and plots, that will be enjoyed by
all.

2) The Town Crier: The town Crier has been set up in various locations
throughout the Mud, in hopes that his database of IC stories will be
used and read by everyone playing Dragon's Fang. He holds the entire
history of the Mud, the RP that has occurred on Fang for the past four
odd years and that hasn't been illustrated in the novels already. If
you think something else should be added. Maybe you've RPed in an event
that you think the Storytellers and especially the rest of the Mud,
should know about. Tell the Storyguide, because  ultimately, its his
responsibility to keep the Crier up-to-date. It can be an excellent way
of having your RP showcased and at the same time, giving RP to others
as well.

3) The Mail System: The mail system, is both IC and OOC in nature. It
can help a great deal in setting up RP. There will be additions to it
in the very near future, which will allow for more diversity and
flexibility in this system, but for now, please use it to set up times
to RP with your friends or people you think you would RP with. Lets say
that you're a Child of the Light and you've spotted an Aiel that you
think needs a beat down. Send him/her off a mail about setting up a
time to RP and your wish to have a scene with them. This doesn't mean
you need to plan out the RP, just that it helps the flow of
commmunication and helps you find more and more RP, which after all, is
the goal.

   The mail system can also be an IC form of communication. Perhaps
you're a soldier, writing a report for your Captain or a Noblewoman,
writing to your husband at war, or maybe you're sending encrypted
correspondence to a fellow player of Daes Dae'mar.  Whatever the
particular situation, you can utilize the mail system for this purpose
as well and ultimately, communication.

rp_basic


Beginning Roleplay including Terms/Terminology:

A. What is IC versus OOC? What is RP?

   Let's start by first defining the terms. IC is short for 'In
Character', OOC is short for 'Out of Character', and RP is shorthand for
'Roleplay'. To go IC in Dragon's Fang, it is a simple toggle command in
which you type 'goic'. To go OOC, you type 'goooc'. When a person
roleplay's, they are expected to always be IC, OOC is for when you are
just talking or leveling your character to make them more powerful
codewise. Being IC means that you are ready for any roleplay that might
just show up your way, regardless of the consequences.

   For those of you who do not know what roleplay is exactly, the best
way I can describe it is acting. A Character is created, by you the
player. All aspects of the Character is thought up, the background
history, looks, merits/flaws and more. When the player goes IC, they
place themselves into the Character and act as that Character would in
the situations that are presented to them in the Wheel of Time World,
using Emotes and Poses. This leads us to our next topic...
#0
rp_emotebasic

B. What is an Emote?

   An emote itself is how one expresses oneself in roleplay on a mud. It
is not uncommon for this command to be supplemented by a pose command
which does similar to emote, only allows you to describe an action
without emote's limitations. An example if your character's name was
George:

** You typed: emote pours a glass of deep red wine into a gold-chased
goblet, swirling the rich alcoholic-laced liquid with a gentle finger.

** Your audience would see:
George pours a glass of deep red wine into a gold-chased goblet,
swirling the rich alcoholic-laced liquid with a gentle finger.

   Essentially, when you type out an emote, if you substitute the word
emote for the name of your character, that is what the others in the
room with you, will see. The same goes for pose, only the name of your
character doesn't show up in the action unless you type it out manually.
An example of pose is:

** You typed: pose Relaxing into a plush, cushioned chair, George lifts
his feet up to rest upon the mahogany coffee table before him, his eyes
closing to half-slits as his deep blue eyes languidly regard the room at
large.

** Your audience would see:
Relaxing into a plush, cushioned chair, George lifts his feet up to rest
upon the mahogany coffee table before him, his eyes closing to
half-slits as his deep blue eyes languidly regard the room at large.

   So beyond the basic mechanics of how to emote, it is an action that
your character performs. They are broadcast to the room that you are
located in, no further, unless there are some special commands given to
a particular guild, to allow for that.

   To describe how one roleplays, it would probably be easiest to tell
you to simply flip open a book and read a few pages of character
interaction. None of us are writers of repute and thus our emotes are
largely going to be inferior than what you see in a novel. This also
doesn't mean you should simply copy what you see, but an emote is
generally something you would find in a novel, especially in the ways
they are written.

   Descriptiveness in emotes is absolutely key. Don't pump out one
liners and wait the minute or two for your rp partner to eloquently
describe, in four lines, what his/her own character is doing. Again,
remember respect for your fellow rper. Put some effort, not only in
describing what others would see coming from your character in facial
features, body language and voice inflection, but do as well as you can
do with grammar and spelling, so that it isn't a pain for anyone to rp
with you. Some may think this harsh and for some, English is definitely
not your primary language. That is totally understandable and you are
certainly not going to be ridiculed for misplacing a tense or an
adjective. Do the best you can, that's all one can ask another to do.

rp_emoteinclude 

C. What should an Emote include

   An Emote should include as much as possible to describe the situation
as clearly as possible to your audience (the people you are roleplaying
with, or simply just others who are watching). I've thought up a few
things that would be extremely nice to have included in an emote, those
include:

1) Where your Character is located in the area.
   Describe where your character is standing so others would know. If
you're near someone, leaning against a tree, then they would probably
like to know that. You can emote specifics, such as,

  "George walks into the area, he pauses next to the tall building in
   the distance as he looks around searching for someone."

Or, you can place yourself relative to another person, such as,

  "George walks into the area, he pauses just behind and slightly to the
   right of Jill as he looks around, searching for someone."

   You can be more descriptive than this easily, this is merely an
example of putting location into an emote.

2) Movements your Character is doing.
   Another really nice thing to include in an emote is what exactly your
character is doing. Your character can be doing anything at any time,
simple things included. A brush of a pant leg to get some dirt off,
hands running through hair, hands balled into fists with the knuckles
white from the tension, walking towards someone with a hand resting on a
sword hilt, kicking dirt off your boots, etc. It can really include
anything. For example, let's continue the emote we started above with
location.

  "George walks into the area, he pauses just behind and slightly to the
   right of Jill as he looks around, searching for someone. He brings up
   a calloused hand to run through his hair as his eyes move from one
   person in the area to the next."

   Of course, the portion of 'as he looks around' and 'walks into the
area', are also movements, I simply added more movements to the emote.
Just a small note here, an emote does not have to just be one sentence.
You don't have to have this huge run-on sentence to describe everything
you want to describe. More than one sentence is allowed in an emote, as
well as easier to understand because it is usually more clear.

3) Facial expressions and what your Character is feeling.
   A common mistake for beginning Roleplayers is to type out emotions in
an emote in an attempt to have the character's feelings come across. I
admit, it is often very difficult to walk the fine line of trying to
come across as feeling this way in a character versus simply and
sometimes inadvertently just telling your audience. You should remember
though, that in reality, unless someone is psychic, they can't really
tell what your emotions are except through signs. We can do that in
Roleplay though, describe the signs of what your character is feeling.
Good signs can be anything from facial expressions, physical actions, a
look in the eye, to even simply words. Let's look at two examples of the
dos and don'ts.

Don't:
  "George walks into the area, he pauses just behind and slightly to the
   right of Jill as he looks around, searching for someone. He brings up
   a calloused hand to run through his hair as his eyes move from one
   person in the area to the next. He wonders if anyone has seen his
   brother, he hasn't seen him in weeks and is worried for him."

   Can you see the mistakes in that last Sentence? For one, no one can
read his mind, and for another, unless someone is psychic, they can't
tell (or shouldn't be able to tell) that George is worried. A good
correction of this would be:

Do:
  "George walks into the area, he pauses just behind and slightly to the
   right of Jill as he looks around, searching for someone. He brings up
   a calloused hand to run through his hair as his eyes move from one
   person in the area to the next. With a worried expression crossing
   his face he sighs and then turns to Jill, asking, "Have you seen my
   brother? His name is Bob."

   With this correction, you get the same feeling coming across, yet
IC'ly a person can tell with the signs, as well as words, instead of
reading the person's mind.

4) What you are saying and to whom.
   The reason for Roleplaying is to interact with others, right? One of
the best ways to interact is through speech. So, most emotes contain
someone saying something to another. Another Tip I can give is to make
sure you put specific names if there is more than one other person in
the room. If you type the emote with a question of 'asks you', then the
three other people in the room aren't quite clear on exactly who you are
speaking to. Look at the corrected emote above. George turned to Jill
and asked her a question.

   You can also add tones and any inflections or even an accent when
speaking to someone. It's quite fun and adds some variety to your
character. An example could be:

  "With a worried expression crossing his face, George sighs and then
   turns to Jill. He asks with a sharply clipped accent, "Be you seeing
   muh Broth'r? He be named Bob."

   Of course, this example is merely that, an example. There are much
better emotes than this above, and I'm sure you'll experience them in
some RP.

5) Anything amiss.
   Another good thing to include in an emote is if anything is different
than the 'norm'. The norm being your description, or if you're any
different than the last time you roleplayed with that person. If you got
your hair cut and haven't had time to change your description, that'd be
a good thing to add. If you got hurt in a fight and are limping, or have
this huge bandage that causes your arm to be pinned to your chest would
both be excellent things to add as well. The rule is, whatever you want
someone to see or notice about you, you should put something in a pose
or emote that they can icly view.

D. What do you do when you first enter a room/area?

   One of the first things you should do before even emoting when you
enter a room/area is to look at the doings and people's descriptions (if
you haven't already read them recently). A doing is a command on
Dragon's Fang that is used to add a dialog behind a person's name that
tells everyone in the room what this person is doing at this point,
where they are at, and anything else the player wants to let others
know. To create a doing, all one would type is:

** doing leaning against a tree, smoking a pipe.

When a person looked in the room, they would see:

** George is leaning against a tree, smoking a pipe.

Notice that I deliberately left out the is when typing in the doing
statement. The program on the game automatically adds it for you.

   When reading the doings of people in the room, you should try to
establish where everyone is located. If you can't do this by reading
doings' and listening to one emote, then sending the person a tell,
asking them is also a way to find out. Once figuring out where everyone
is situated, try to get a semi-decent understanding of what's going on,
and if anything dramatic isgoing on at the moment.

   Once you have an impression of where people are located and
approximately what they're doing (this shouldn't take more than a minute
or two), the next step is to emote your entrance using the guidelines
above and have fun!

Starting Out - Character Creation:

   When you're just starting out, there are several major factors you
should keep in mind when creating a character. These factors include
the who, what, where, why and how questions. These are only a few
questions one can come up with when thinking about a new Character:
Who are you? What is your personality? What do you want to be able to
do? Where are you from? Why are you the way you are? How do you do the
things you do?

A.  What to keep in mind when thinking up a Character

1)  Who are you?
   So, who are you? What is your name? What do you want to look like?
Do you have family and friends? Where are they now? Do you have a
horse? A dog? You can come up with many, many things to answer when
thinking up answers to the Who am I question. I would suggest getting
only as detailed as you feel comfortable, because you'll have to
remember all these details later in order to Roleplay your character.

2)  Where is the Character From?
   This question is another rather obvious one. Answer it, then
try to expand on it. Where did you grow up? Did you move? Did you
have friends left behind? Did you know the area well? What morals
were instilled into your character because of where you grew up?

   These are just a few more questions you can answer to develop
your Character more.

3)  What type of Character do you want?
   This is a rather important question. Do you want your character to
be a fighter? A thinker? A lover? A thief? A wimp? A lord? lady? This
will help you in building your background if you know what type you
want to be.

4)  What type of Personality do you want your Character to have?
   Personality is rather important for any Character, especially if you
want to have 'depth'. Human beings are complex creatures, this means
you don't just have to always display one emotion. Your character could
be very short tempered and easy to peeve off, but, quickly satiated by
a honeycake.. Your Character could be really shy, or really flirty, or
flirty when they don't like someone and shy when they do. Or, your
Character could have an immense hatred for blondes, or for some obscure
reason be so soft-hearted they want to help any injured animal they
cross. Try to think up little quirks your Character has, it makes
things more interesting for both you and your Roleplay partners.

    Remember though, that whatever you think up here, you should think
up a reason why your Character is this way.. did something bad happen?
Nothing bad ever happened so your Character is trusting? A blonde broke
your heart? Only blondes broke your heart? Your father was a blonde and
beat you when you were younger? There's always something interesting to
put into a background to explain the reasons why.

5)  What Merits or Flaws does your Character have?
   This goes hand in hand with personality. Your Character could be
kind hearted, or cold hearted, or really easy to anger, or just plain
apathetic. The more developed your character is, the more interested
and multi-faceted they will be to Roleplay. Other types of merits and
flaws could be the physical and mental. Does your character only have
one eye? How did that happen? Does your Character have a limp? How? Is
your Character really strong? Do they work out? Lift heavy objects
daily? Is your Character really weak? Is your Character mentally
unstable and prone to go off at the slightest noise, or burst out
crying? There are many, many things you can think of. Be creative, you
have the freedom to do so.

6)  What do you want your Character to look like?
   What did your parents look like? Do you take after them? Your
grandparents? Is your Character tall, short, wide, skinny, weak, pale,
dark.. what?

rp_background


B.  Creating a Good Background

   In creating a good background, including everything from the
questions above is a major plus. If you have given your Character a
merit, explain how. If your Character knows how to do something,
explain when and where they learned, how long it took to learn, and
who taught them. The more detailed the better. Explaining where you
are from, things about your family, things about the place you grew up
at, little stories from your past that made you the way you are today
(personality)... all this makes up your background, and answering the
Who, What, Why, When, Where, How is a good way to make sure you cover
your bases.

rp_description

C.  Creating a Good Description

   One of the most important things about rping on a game such as ours,
is a good, solid workable description. You may then ask, "What's a
good, solid, workable description?" A proper description is one that
eloquently describes your character's form. In the description, you
should outline what kinds of clothing are being worn; what is visible
through the clothing; what parts of your character's body is bare
skin; what peculiar objects, if any, your character is carrying; any
distinctive markings such as scars, tattoos, or any other deformities
or outstanding qualities one might see at a glance. Basically, what
you're doing is taking a  snapshot of your character and describing
that snapshot. Do not put any actions in the description, remember that 
snapshot is a still-image photo and that you're not moving, smiling
or grinning like a fool or otherwise in a good or bad mood. You can
describe the moods common to your character, their general disposition,
but remember that anything specific should appear in your emotes,
rather than in your description. Here are some examples to help you
along, both from the Wheel of Time universe and from modern day
society.

Example 1:   Long red tresses frame a plain face, a strong chin and
two deep-set emerald green eyes, perhaps the only features one might
call beautiful or even handsome. A scar runs from his left ear, down to
his chin, a long, almost angry slash as if some clawed thing had raked
him in the night. His 6-2, perhaps 200 pound form is garbed in shirt
and jeans of a uniform blue, the fabric rather faded as it clings to
his muscled body. A very worn leather flight jacket has been pulled
across his broad shoulders, left open to reveal a small silver chain
which hangs down on to his chest, oft fingered by one of his calloused
hands. All in all, he has an air of seclusion about him, introspective
if you will, drawn into himself.

Example 2:   Eyes like deep brown unreadable stones, stare out of a
hardened, chiselled face with firm chin, broad mouth, high cheek bones
and shoulder length brown hair that is brushed back from his face, but
whose strands from time to time, fall into his eyes and obscure vision.
His roughly six foot tall frame, is well-muscled and clad in finely
woven wool tunic and breeches of a deep green, a roaring lion
emblazoned upon the left of his tunic, a rose wrapped sword upon the
right. A cloak of equally fine wool, is slung across his shoulder, the
fabric in the same dark hew as his other clothing. His hands are all
that is bare except his face, the thick fingers and palms covered in
thick callouses created by the wielding of a sword, a ring of high
quality gold, encircling his right ring finger. Despite his hard and
unyielding appearance, a light shines in his eyes, a rediscovered joy
that is ever-present beneath his outwardly cold bearing.

Example 3:   Prim is this small figure, barely reaching 5' 2". A
slender form draped in a silken dress of the softest blue. Her hair, a
dark brown is pulled back almost extremely, into a proficient bun,
sometimes a ponytail at the base of her neck, and other times into a
long braid... but always back, away from her face and eyes. Her
features are angular, her cheekbones high and looking back from her
ever so pale blue eyes, a hawks look. Her angular face, small, pointy
nose and sharp eyes give her the distinct similarity to a hawk or
predatory bird. She often walks softly, purposefully, and almost every
single one of her actions carefully planned out, even folding her hands
before her. She has a look of extreme intelligence, and a streak of
gray can be seen on her left temple, near her bangs. Her face is
smooth, pale as porcelain and completely ageless.

The following is a document containing all the important factors
about channeling that one may wish to keep in mind, while
roleplaying. Please note that these are book referenced facts and
have been simply compiled, in hopes that they will be read,
thought of and considered when one roleplays a character of this
nature.

Help proposal1: A summary of the Five Flows.
Help proposal2: An analysis of Saidin and Saidar, how they contrast.
Help proposal3: Comparing male and female strengths.
Help proposal4: Analysis of weaving.
Help proposal5: The dangers of the One Power.


Conclusion: While the Power is something that only Robert Jordan
knows the ins and outs of, we can make many educated guesses in
hopes of roleplaying it properly. Above all these concepts and
rules though, is the need for common sense. If you, the player,
keep in mind the fact that you are not god, but a mortal with
merits and flaws, abilities and drawbacks, you will be able to rp
a very successful Channeler. It is always entertaining to play a
character who can kill anyone, do anything, but it will simply
lead to problems in a multi-user environment.

The Five flows: Air, Water, Earth, Spirit and Fire are all
components of the One Power.

  Air: The most often used flow and one of the simplest. It is a
flow designed to manipulate tangible objects, by using the ever-
present air around us, hardening it into walls, wrapping it
around objects or people, creating platforms to walk upon,
whatever the case may be, Air on its own, is simply the
manipulation of the plain oxygen and Nitrogen mix we live and
breathe.

  Water: Unlike Air, this flow is not simply at hand at all
times. It is drawn from the moisture-laden air and from the
clouds in the sky or from bodies of nearby water but unlike Air,
it is not always surrounding us and easily accessible. For
example, if one wished to use Water and Fire to create a
lightning bolt or storm, one must set the conditions for using
the Water element by moving clouds into the proper position and
then weaving the lightning, using the cloud's water content as
the catalyst for the electricity. Otherwise, Water like Air,
Spirit and Fire, is a flow predominantly used in healing.

  Spirit: This is perhaps the most unusual and complex element of
the One Power. Largely used for weaves of creation or for the
mind, this flow allows the Channeler to create illusions, use
Compulsion, change the shape and state of animate and inanimate
objects, to create something out of nothing. Examples of
predominantly Spirit-woven weaves are dreaming traps, light-woven
invisibility, Shielding, severing and Aes Sedai bonding.

  Fire: Much like Air and Water, this flow is around us at all
times. It is presumed, though not confirmed by any known source,
that simply applying the laws of physics will explain much of how
these flows work together. For example, if you increase the pace
of atoms in air, you create heat. If you do this at a rapid
enough rate, you will create a tangible weave of fire. Therefore,
using Air and Fire, you are able to not only set the conditions
for a fireball, but are able to use the air to shape the fire and
direct it to its intended target. Otherwise, this component of
the One Power, is simple, much like air and Water.

  Earth: Like fire, this flow is simply elements of the ground we
stand upon or bits of the air, drawn out to form hardened pieces
of rock or dirt. It is shown to us in The Great Hunt, from
Egwene's vague description of her Ore-finding talent, that Earth
is perhaps more complex than fire, Air or Water, in that it
allows one to delve into the earth and search for elements lying
therein, such as metals in her case. How this would be done, is
simply speculation, but perhaps this is an example of the more
magical, fictional, side of the One Power, rather than the
previously illustrated scientific part.

  Having described the simple elements of the One Power in their
component parts, the next step is to determine how they work
together. Singly, the flows will do little but their obvious
purpose, like for example, using simple flows of Air as a wrap to
halt the motion of an object or to lift it, or otherwise
manipulate it. Working in tangent however, is an entirely
different story. Weaves woven of Air, Water and Spirit for
example, has been the traditional method of Aes Sedai healing.
Using Spirit and combining that with Air and Water, you set the
conditions for the weave to heal by how you weave it and then you
simply allow it to run its intended course.

Saidin and Saidar: The two halves of the One Power are as
different as men and women, a direct corilation in fact. Saidin
is a male characterized power, a strong, unyielding, war-like
force that needs to be directed, not listened to. It is a weapon
of destruction or healing, but a weapon all the same,. Like
Saidar however, Saidin is still a sweet, intoxicating power. For
all of its war-like struggle for freedom from its holder, once
guided, Saidin is a powerful tool for good or evil. A quote from
the novels concerning holding Saidin: "That fight that told a man
he was alive." This is exactly what Saidin is. When going into
the Void, one pushes all emotion aside, in exchange for calmness
and serenity. Only then, is one able to dominate and control
Saidin and force it to submit to the will of the wielder. When
that person manages to control Saidin, they feel everything
sharper, smells, sight, hearing, taste, everything is amplified
quite significantly. Yet, there is a difference. Wrapped in the
void, one can not simply feel these enhancements and truly
understand them. It is best described as if everything was
clearer, yet as if you were riding in the back of someone else's
mind, an intimate observer but only an observer, feeling it
second hand, not the immediacy of total contact.
  Saidar, on the other hand, is quite different. Saidar is an
embracing of power, an opening up, an envelopping, immercing, in
the strength that is the female half of the True Source. Holding
Saidar is a submission to a sweet, glorious and addictive
superior power. Once submitting to this power, the wielder is in
total command of Saidar, yee, the threat of overdrawing the
Source is even moreso than wielders of Saidin. The sweet,
intoxicating, glory of Saidar can be so overwhelming if drawn in
vast amounts, that only an extreme will of iron, combined with
long years of wielding Saidar, can prevent the woman from simply
drawing the essence into her and burning herself out. This is why
Aes Sedai train their charges so agonizingly slow, for increasing
the pace of their training, also increases the chance of simply
cutting oneself off from the very glorious power they are trying
to draw more of.

Comparing male and female strengths: this has ever been a
contencious issue whenever male channelers contact wfemale ones.
Male channelers are almost invariably stronger than female
channelers on a one-on-one level. Whether simply blessed with the
ability to grasp more sheer volume of the One Power or whether
this is a characteristic difference between Saidin and Saidar, is
unknown, yet it is clearly stated that unless a very powerful
woman contacts a weaker male, the male will be stronger than the
woman. For example, women sent to shield Rand or many of the
other stronger false Dragons, would have been in the more
powerful ranks of the Aes Sedai. yet it is clearly written that
six of these Aes Sedai are not a match for one such False Dragon.
Having said that, your average male channeler who is perhaps less
than half the strength of Rand or Logain or any of the stronger
Forsaken, would only be able to handle two or three of these Aes
Sedai at the very most and most likely with a tremendous amount
of risk involved in the undertaking. 
  However, men cannot link together with other men unless they
have women to support the link. this has always been the
counterbalancing factor when  conflicts between male and female
channelers arise. Women are able to link together, to a daunting
number of thirteen, while men, unless they have a female to link
with, cannot link with a single other man. Thus, when women
approach men to gentle them or capture them, a link of such
numbers or at least something more than six or seven Aes Sedai,
is required to be assured of the capture and in overpowering the
man.

Weaving: While much of this area of channeling lies in the realm
of fiction and assumed action, there are parts of the mechanics
of weaving, described in various places throughout the novels.
The main point that is brought up time and time again is one's
ability in a particular flow, amplifying the effectiveness of the
woven weave. For example, Elayne in book four, while journeying
to Tanchico, has an opportunity to observe a Windfinder at work
on the Seafolk vessel she is using to travel from Tear to
Tarabon. While Elayne could in theory, perform the weaves that
the Windfinder executed with such skill, she stated that she
could not possibly be able to affect a tenth of the weather the
Windfinder was able to. Elayne is perhaps one of the top ten
female Channelers living in the current world in terms of
potential and raw power, while the Windfinder was a great deal
weaker than the Daughter-heir. 
  This situation yields much information in
regards to the mechanics of channeling. Mainly, if a Channeler is
shown how to weave something and is given practice with weaving
the displayed weave, they not only become more adept in the
weave, their strength in the particular flow also increases.
While this may seem like the channeler may simply keep practicing
and becoming a super Channeler, this is not the case. Perhaps the
analogy of a muscle would be appropriate to describe this
concept. If one does not use their muscles, they atrophy and
weaken and shrink, to the point where one cannot perform tasks
one used to be able to do with ease. However, if one uses their
muscles often, exercises them, tests them and stretches them to
the limit, one becomes stronger until they have reached their
physiological limit.
  So it is with Weaving and perhaps, gives insight into why the
older Aes sedai and Wise Ones, are often a great deal more adept
in the arts of channeling, than the younger channelers, save of
course, the notable exceptions outlined in the books.
  One last point on Weaving. It is often stated that a channeler
is shaped by who he or she is taught by. For example, if a woman
is shown the fireball weave by her Aes sedai teacher, and said
teacher flings out her arm to release the fireball, that is
ingrained into how the weave is woven for the student. The
student will have to make the arm gesture to complete the weave
or otherwise, it will not run its proper course.
  This also shows why the Age of Legends produced so many
talented Channelers, with many diverse and complicated skills.
They were able to teach their students how to channel and what to
channel, without also passing on the flaws of the teacher to the
pupil.

Dangers of Channeling: Channeling is a very dangerous, very risky
process without any sort of formal training. Even Rand al'Thor,
the absolute cream of the crop where the One Power is concerned,
is lost and left floundering in regards to Saidin, until he is
able to cut Asmodean off from the Dark One and force the former
Forsaken to show him the pitfalls of the True Source. Before this
point, he ran the risk, every time he grasped Saidin, if he could
grasp it in the first place, of losing control of the battle with
Saidin and simply drawing too much power to handle without having
it burn his mind away. 
  What one must keep in mind in roleplay is simply this. Your
character must have formal training in the One Power before he or
she can do much beyond lighting a candle. Even if this
hypothetical character attempted to light the candle, half the
time they would fail to reach the One Power and the rest of the
time, they would not be able to focus the Power enough to perform
the designed task. Not only does one not know how to wield the
One Power without training, they simply do not know how to reach
it and if they were able to reach it, they are more apt to
destroy themselves than do anything useful.

SKIM SKIMMING
Very similar to Gating, this technique of travelling is slower
but it allows one to move from point A, to point B, without
having to know your starting point intimately. Fashioning a gate
that carries you into a void, you use a platform to carry you to
your destination, which takes moments or seconds, depending on
where you are travelling in the world. When you reach your
destination, another Gateway will open, allowing you to exit the
void, and appear at the intended target.

OBSCENE

Obscene is a channel for only the strong-minded. If you want to hear
your ears burn, have your eyes pop, or just plain be offensive,
turn it on. It starts off for all new players, and if you prefer
the cleaner side of things, it is suggested you keep it off. Most
things are fair game on the channel, and below is a definition of
what is not. With the existence of this, remind yourself again
that the other channels, including GDT, TT, and all guild channels
are to stay clean.

Usage:     Obscene <message>
Toggling:  noobscene

Yes, this channel's definition is one without policy. Yet in the
spirit of not seriously offending anyone, some ground rules need
to be laid. Note that this channel is very much a privilage; you
can curse and cuss on it all you want, but if anyone truly derives
anger or hurt from it, it is gone. Simply stating, do not bring
heavy flames to the channel. It is fine if they stay somewhat
controlled, but when a mortal or an immortal's name is being thrown
around and accused, that has crossed the line. We all like to flame
from time to time when ticked off, but if you really have a problem
with someone, there are other ways to handle it. Secondly, and
finally, do not have sex on the channel. Do not write paragraphs,
lines, quotes, or anything else having to do with the act. You can
allude to it, you can brag about yourself (not that anyone will
believe you), but do not start making examples of it. That should
stay private. Otherwise, have fun with the channel, and remember
that you can always turn it off.

"AES SEDAI"

   3000 years ago when the Breaking of the World shattered the known
lands and scattered peoples, the channelers of that time, called 
Aes Sedai (the Servants of All in the Old Tongue) came to be
all that stood between success and failure for the light against
the Shadow. 
   In the act of freeing the lands from the Shadow's impending
domination, the male Aes Sedai received a crippling blow from the
Dark One to their abilities, every last one of them eventually driven
to madness through their very link to the source of their power;
thus when we speak of Aes Sedai since we refer to women who can
channel the female half of the True Source, from which the Aes Sedai's
power is drawn in the form of the One Power. This can be a fearsome weapon
in their hands, though the strength of the abilities varies from 
one person to the other.
  The title of the Aes Sedai is bestowed by either the Rebel
Tower, a group who felt that the White Tower's policies were
unjust, and by the White Tower, who has trained women to channel
for generations. 
  Blamed for the Breaking of the World despite what they did to
stop the Shadow, they are not trusted by the general population
and yet few rulers go without an Aes Sedai advisor. Their
knowledge is unparalleled but for what use they put that
knowledge is unclear to all but their own kind.

ENHANCE

  Seeking to improve their importance and prestige across the
lands, Craftsmen managed to develop a method of improving the
armor of a warrior. Using a technique known only to themselves,
they return pieces of armor to the customer improved many times
over.
  Beware that some metals or special substances of which armor is
made, cannot be improved by these skilled smiths.
The Enhance skill is a guildskill, known only to Aiel Blacksmiths
and the Traveling People (Tinkers). It is used on a weapon to
increase its damage roll, or on armor to improve its absorbance
and AC.

WOLFNAME

   The wolfkin refer to each other not by their human names, but
with a name chosen that is special to each.
   You can only choose that name once in a lifetime; if it needs
to be changed for some reason, only an Immortal can set that for
you, so choose it carefully!
   Before his name among the wolfkin has been chosen, that person's
projected thoughts and emotions will be barely more than whispers
in the night - sooner or later he has to lay claim to a name.
   The command is "\c03wolfname <name>\c00".

TOOL
  In times past, there have been periods when the great smiths of
the lands have not been sought out to perform their trade.
Seeking to find another method of drawing customers, the
Craftsmen drew together for a great council and
after that meeting was completed, many new inventions had been
made.
  Chiefly among these new ways of earning coin, was the skill
of Tooling. Using new alloys and other secrets known only by 
these smiths, they were able to change the appearence of almost
any object, save that most mysterious of alloys, Heartstone. 
  Finding someone to perform this task is rare but if you stumble
across a smith with talent, prepare to hand over a fee for the
service.

CAEMLYN ANDOR DIRECTIONS LOST


Caemlyn was built to be as IC as possible, and while not all
of its descriptions are IC (yet), the layout is. Each gate is
in its proper place; there are 5 outer gates and two gates to
the Inner City. The Oval Plaze is at the foot of the Andoran
Royal Palace, and each road which is supposed to be in Caemlyn
according to the books thus far, is. 
 
This makes Caemlyn a wonderful place in which to roleplay.
It can also make Caemlyn extremely confusing. Anyone who has
ever studied the maps of Caemlyn from the Wheel of Time books
knows that Caemlyn is very oddly-shaped, with several distinct
"neighborhoods" of twisting, maze-ish streets. Thankfully,
here on Dragon's Fang, Caemlyn is scaled down to a reasonable
size. So, the streets are slightly less like mazes than they
appear to be in the books. But they are not all straight and
simple, and the helpfiles are designed to help anyone find
their way around the city.  
 
Each street in Caemlyn has its own helpfile. Study them as
you walk through Caemlyn. Each helpfile gives directions to
the oval plaza and describes where that street is in relation
to other streets. Here is a list of Caemlyn's streets, in
alphabetical order:

KEYWORDS "KEY WORDS"

The old algorithm for finding rooms was kinda stupid. You could only send in 
one keyword at the time. With the new code, you can send in a list of 
keywords, where each keyword must be a substring of the rooms name, in 
order for a match to occur, for instance:

lia will match Illian, Liams, liandrin, etc...
Illian Sewer Entrance, will only match rooms which contain these three words
in it's title, or substrings of, for instance: 
The First Room of the Illian Sewer Entrance 

will match, as will:

The Second Sewer Entrance of Illian. 

Ordering of keywords doesn't matter. 
Numbers can still be used todenote orders, for instance.
2.Illian Road

Will match with the second room having Illian and Road as substrings of
it's name. 

To use this new feature with SPEEDWALK or CART, just supply your list of 
keywords, for instance:

cart Centre Caemlyn
speedwalk Caemly Pigeo Courier

To use it with Gate, supply your list enclosed in '', for instance:

weave 'gate' 'Chosen Gathering Area'

Gate will still work with the old syntax, as longas you only have one 
keyowrd, for instance:

weave 'gate' Caemlyn

TRAINS PRACTICES
Trains are gained with levels. They can be used to gain skills and weaves at a 
skills trainer or to raise stats at a stats trainer.
Trainers can be found at various places throughout the MUD. However, the most
frequently used trainers are w, sw of the of the oval.

Practices are also gained with each level and are used to practice skills and
weaves once they are gained. Trains and practices can be interchanged using
the tutor and achieve commands at the skills trainer.

HUNGER THIRST EAT DRINK NOHUNGER

If you stick around long enough you will get hungry and thirsty. Being hungry
causes your hit points, mana and movements to regenerate at a slower rate. To
alleviate this you need to eat and drink occasionally. In order to eat you 
must have a food item in your inventory and to drink you must either be in the 
same room as a fountain (fountain, stream, pool, etc.) or have a water 
container in your inventory. Food and water containers can be bought from the 
peddler in the oval. 
Hunger and thirst are not fatal, however, and for those of you who wish to
rid yourselves of those annoying messages there is a nohunger toggle. To
use it simply type nohunger


Usage: eat [food name]
        drink [container name/fountain name]
        nohunger

BUY LIST

Occasionally it is necessary for you to buy items. This is quite easy to do.
When in the same room as a shopkeeper mob, simply type list to see a list of
all the items for sale and their prices. Once you know what you wish to buy
you may proceed in many different ways.


usage: buy #3 (Buys the third item on the list)
       buy item_name (Buys the first item on the list with a specific name)
       buy 4.item_name (Buys the fourth item on the list with a specific 
       name)
       buy 3 item/item number (Buys 3 of the item. Much less spammy than 
       buying the item three times)

GAIN PRACTICE

You will doubtless wish to gain and practice skills and weaves during the
game. To do this you will need to be at a skills trainer, the most frequently
used of which can be found w, sw of the oval. While at the skills trainer you
may type gain to see a list of the skills and weaves that you are able to
gain. Once you decide on a skill you want, simply type gain skillname to gain
it. After you've gained it you will need to practice it. To do that type 
practice skillname. Typing practice at any time will show you a list of skills
that you have gained.

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -20 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:


  \c03AC \c07 Roughly equivalent to\c00
-----------------------------------------------------------
  10  Naked person
   0  Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields")
 -20  Armored battle tank

ACRONYMS

        Here are some of the acronyms you are likely to encounter
during your stay in the Dragon's Fang.

\c02OOC:\c00    Out Of Character. Since Dragon's Fang is a Role Playing Mud,
        when you talk to someone you are supposed to be whoever your
        character is, unless you are OOC - in other words, when you
        are OOC it is you, the player sitting in front of the screen
        doing the talking and not the character you are playing.
\c03IC :\c00    In Character. Whenever you are not OOC, you are IC, which means
        that the character you are playing is doing the talking. This
        is the mode you will be assumed to be in, unless otherwise
        specified.
\c01RP :\c00    Role Playing. Whatever you do while you are IC is RPing. The
        Dragon's Fang is a role playing Mud, which means characters
        there like and interact as if they belonged to the fantasy world
        that the Mud uses as a setting.
\c07AFK:\c00    Away From Keyboard. An Internet term rather than a Mud one,
 this
        just means that when you are AFK you are no longer sitting in
        front of your computer, but are somewhere else at the time.
        Please let other people know you are AFK (in your title, or
        using the AFK command) so that they don't talk to you while you
        aren't there to respond.
\c06Newbie:\c00 Whoever is new to the lands of the Dragon's Fang. You will
        also be carrying the [Poor Newbie] title on the left of your names
        in the who list until you make it to the 5th level of experience.

A'DAM

  Device created by the Seanchan.  It is a ter'angreal:  a collar and
bracelet linked together by a leash, all of silver.  A woman who can be
taught to channel wear the bracelet and control the woman born with the
spark and wears the collar.  It creates a link between the two women.  
When complete, the Sul'dam know what the Damane is doing with the Power.
The Damane can not channel without the Sul'dam permission or she will get
sick. The more Power she will draw without permission, the sicker she will
become.
  Both women are aware of the other's feeling, like anger, fear
and, sadness, although the Sul'dam can control what feelings are shared
through the leash.  The Sul'dam can make the Damane feel things through
the a'dam, like pain or pleasure. The Damane can not touch any weapon, nor
anything she think of as a weapon, or she will get sick.  The Damane can  
not move the bracelet of the a'dam when no Sul'dam wears it.  The farther 
she will try to move it, the sicker she will become, until unconsciousness.
  When a Damane and a Sul'dam are joined, whatever the Sul'dam feels, the  
Damane feels ten times over, even to death.  It is why a Damane may never  
strike at her Sul'dam, but she must protect her even more than herself.    
If the leash of the a'dam is broken when a Damane and a Sul'dam wear the   
a'dam, they die.  If a man who can channel touches the a'dam, both women   
suffer, as if shocked, from the touch.  If a man who channels wears the    
a'dam, he will die and so will the sul'dam if any, the listeners in the    
Raven Tower use the A'dam as a questioning tactic, and torture.  A'dams    
do not work on women that can not channel.

A'dam are restricted to the Seanchan guild. The only means of obtaining one
is to join the guild, or have a speical conference with the GL.

AFK
The AFK flag (Away From Keyboard) is handy to use to show others
that you are not reachable. You can customise your AFK flag by typing :
  &rTOGGLE AFK <message>&n
For example, if my name is Nynaeve and I wish to be AFK, I can give a
reason for being AFK. I would just type:
   &rTOGGLE AFK Nynaeve is AFK to thump someone with a stick.&n
If you then telled Nynaeve while she was AFK, the following messaage
would be displayed:
     Nynaeve is AFK to thump someone with a stick.
     &rYou tell Nynaeve,"owww"&n
AFK can be turned off by typing TOGGLE AFK again.

"AIEL"

        Far to the east of the mainlands, beyond the concealing line of the
Spine of the World, dwell a race of people known as the Aiel. The land,
called the Waste by some and the Three-fold Land by its inhabitants,
has beaten these people into the most hardy race in the world. They
live in constant peril of the wild desert environment, surviving by means
of their spears and relentless fight training. Because of their harsh
lifestyle, many have come to call them savages, believing them
bloodthirsty killers of any who dare trespass on their land. They
are considered primitive and barbaric. Yet to those who truly know their
society, these savages are much more civilized. They consider the average
man soft, his woman weak, and his lifestyle greedy and wasteful. Thus
were born the terms wetlander and, for his lands, wetlands.
        An Aiel is typically no shorter than 177cm (5'10"), the men almost
universally at least 190cm (6'3") and reaching heights even beyond
215cm (7'). All Aiel have darkly tanned skin due to constant exposure
of desert sun and wind, and their hair is a range from platinum blonde
to blazing red. The clothing of an Aiel is brown, green, or grey algode
and leathers. Metal is scarce for armor and tends to be avoided to aid
in movement and speed. Jewelry is also only worn by few, rings never
used. Each Aiel is well clothed against the elements, with a cadin'sor of
boots, pants, and coat or a blouse, skirt, and shawl for the more peaceful
women. Hair styles are also unique to the Aiel, the hair trimmed short save
a long, thin tail in the back.  All Aiel are slim and quick, though their
 lifespan
is considered relatively short.
        The society itself is set up in 12 Clans, each with their own
 individual
septs. It is based on farming, hunting, and fighting. The brunt of the
 population
spends its time within the camps, called Holds.  The women take care of the
home and the young.  The men can often be herders of the ewes, goats, and
cattle, farmers of the zemai, or workers like potters, jewelers, miners,
 metalsmiths,
and blacksmiths.  The women often keep the home and Hold, or serve the sept
as Wise Ones.  Society, however, depends on fighting.  It is the livelyhood of
the Aiel and the very base structure of all septs.  Men act as the chiefs of
 the
people, while women run the Holds themselves.  The Wise Ones are the healers
of the septs and also the 'meddling' politicians that always dip their hands in
a Chief's business. Some would say they are the true leaders of the septs.
        All Aiel are taught to fight, given their first spear at age 5 and
 their first
real training by age 10. It typically takes between 6-10 years to graduate into
 a
fighting Society and become a full-fledged Spear. This training is for men and
women alike, something somewhat unique to the world.  Fighting, what the Aiel
call the Dance, is driven exclusively by a code of honor called Ji'e'toh.  The
weapons typical to an Aiel are either three short spears or a single long one,
the length up to personal taste though a female's is usually a foot shorter.
 The
blade is about a foot long of double sided metal, and the Aiel wields it both
like a lance and a bo staff.  The Aiel will also use a long knife almost the
 length
of a short sword, a horn bow that is small yet as effective as a longbow, and a
small hide shield called a buckler strapped to an arm that the Aiel may also
 use
as a weapon.  All Aiel are trained in both weapons and martial arts, making
 them
formidible opponents when experienced.
        There comes a time in an Aiel's life to decide whether or not to lay
 down
the spear and move on.  This happens mostly to the women, who may choose to
start a family or become a Wise One.  The Wise Ones are unique to the society,
and more respected than the Chiefs themselves.  Only women are allowed to
channel the One Power, by Ji'e'toh, and all women channelers become Wise Ones.
Men who can channel always pick up their honor and trek into the Blight to try
and kill the Dark One.  They never return.  Men who choose to lay down the
spear take up farming or craftwork.  Yet even by no longer actively fighting,
 all
Aiel know how to defend themselves.
        Historically, Dancing takes place only when the septs or Clans
themselves go to war.  When Clans war consistently with each other, this is
called a Blood Feud.  Battles are usually fought over the use of the waterwells
scarce to the land.  However, now  the leader of the Aiel prophesized to
appear, and prophesized to break the Nation, has arrived, and 11 of the Clans
have put aside their differences to rally behind this Car'a'carn, Rand al'Thor.
The 12th, the Shaido, has broken away to the Dragonmount and camp there
now, plotting the demise of both Rand and the other Aiel.  The Spears and
Wise Ones have come west beyond the Spine and into the wetlands.  What
happens there is up to them.

AIELSAYINGS

The Aiel are known to have strange sayings among their people, words which
confuse the average wetlander. It has become apparent that the Aiel all know
how to speak in Old Tongue, as often their sayings include these words.
Here are some of the most common of sayings:

  Typical Greeting: "I see you, Aiel/wetlander. My name is Sorilea, Wise One
                     of the Jarra Chareen. See me."

  Typical Farewells: "May you find Shade this day."
                     "Water and Shade."
                     "Sleep well to Wake again."

  Honoring: "My water is yours."

  Peace of Rhuidean: "The peace of Rhuidean be on you. Who comes to Chaendaer
                      may return to their holds in peace. There shall be no
                      blood on the ground."
 
  Asking To Enter Hold: CC - "I ask leave to enter your hold, roofmistress."
                        others - "Roofmistress, I ask leave to come beneath
 your roof."
    The Reply: sept - "You have my leave. Beneath my roof there is water and
                      shade for you. The * Sept is always welcome."
               lone(beggar) - "You have my leave to step beneath my roof. Water
 and
                              shade will be found for you."

  Aiel Oath: Aiel 1 - "Till Shade is Gone
		       Till Water is Gone
		       Into the Shadow with teeth bared
		       Screaming defiance with the last breath
                       To spit in Sightblinder's eye
		       On the Last Day."
	     Aiel 2 - "By my honor and the Light
		       My life will be a dagger for Sightblinder's heart."
	     Aiel 1 - "Till the Last Day, to Shayol Ghul itself."

  Greeting Wolfkin: "I see you, Seia'cair."

AIELREQS

  To be guilded you must fulfill these requirements:
   * Be level 20 or above.
   * Not be a male channeler.
   * Have a Clan chosen and a description set.
   * Have a history/story. The guilding process is IC and related to the
     idea that you were separated somehow from the Nation and are returning.
     Histories should have something to do with your being away.
   * One sponser from any Aiel already guilded.

AIELCLAN

  The Aiel are divided into twelve clans, eleven of which have accepted
Rand al'Thor as He Who Comes with the Dawn. These clans are:\c06
   Chareen
   Codarra
   Daryne
   Goshien
   Miogama
   Nakai
   Reyn
   Shaarad
   Shaido
   Shiande

\c00
  The \c01Shaido\c00 are the only clan that has not accepted Rand al'Thor
as He Who Comes with the Dawn, and they have rebelled, claiming their
own Clan Chief, Couladin, as He Who Comes with the Dawn. They have
attacked the rest of the Aiel, and discarded Ji'e'toh (see\c07 JI'E'TOH\c00).
For that they have been outcast, and those Aiel who succumb to the
Bleakness and run away to join the Shaido (see \c07HELP AIELRANKS\c00) are
 named
the \c05Mera'din.\c00

AIELSOCIETIES
  Most of the Aiel, but not all, join a warrior society. All of these
societies, except for the Maidens of the Spear, are exclusively male.
The \c06Maidens of the Spear\c00 have as their special mission the protection
of He Who Comes with the Dawn, and never marry, dedicating their lives
to the spear. The societies are:

  \c06Seia Doon\c00        - The Black Eyes make some of the best sentries,
 both day
                             and night, and best eyes for seeing objects or
 people a
                             long distance away. When they fight, the dance
 tends to 
                             be silent and ruthless.
  \c06Far Aldazar Din\c00  - The Brothers of the Eagle are the loners of the
 Nation,
                             much preferring a day alone to a game of Flip.
 They tend
			     to be quieter and more distanced from others, but also
			     know more about the animals and areas of the lands. They
			     are some of the best hunters.
  \c06Rahien Sorei\c00     - The Dawn Runners are the messengers of the Nation.
			     They have the highest endurance and can even run
			     from Caemlyn back home to the Three-fold Land
			     without stopping.
  \c06Sovin Nai\c00        - Instead of the Spear, the Knife Hands prefer
 closer
			     combat. They make good side attackers and ambushers,
			     best able to get in close before the enemy realizes
			     it. They also manage to have the best rough tongues,
			     though Maidens come close for these insults. Finally,
			     they have always made the best bodyguards.
  \c06Hama N'dore\c00      - The Mountain Dancers know the terrain and how to
 adapt
			     best to it. They are some of the most proficient
			     climbers and can always find a trail to or around
			     an obstacle. Sure of foot, they make good middle
			     attackers in a formation to contain the enemy.
  \c06Cor Darei\c00        - The Night Spears are just as their name sounds.
 They
			     function very well at night. They make wonderful
			     night scouts or sentries, and are some of the best
			     at ambushing and sneaking around.
  \c06Aethan Dor\c00       - The Red Shields are considered the Police force of
			     the Nation. They often patrol and always bring up
			     legalities of Ji'e'toh or whatever is pertinent to the
			     conversation. They make very good City Patrol representatives,
			     and are always good to have as friends.
  \c06Shae'en M'Taal\c00   - Often the brunt of jokes, the Stone Dogs are
 notorious
			     for being dimwitted and thick-skulled. They make up
			     the rear guard of an attack - the base of any formation.
			     They also refuse to flee from any fight, not because of
			     speed, but because of brute strength, endurance.. and a
			     little bit of dull thoughts.
  \c06Sha'mad Conde\c00    - By far the swiftest both of foot and tongue, the
			     Thunder Walkers make good first attackers, usually in
			     a surprise flanking maneuver or dead on blitz, because
			     they can get in and out quickly. However, they do not
			     last long in endurance tests.
  \c06Tain Shari\c00       - By far the most stringent with Ji'e'toh, the True 
Bloods
			     know it better than anyone. They feel that following this Honor
			     as strictly as possible is the most important thing of daily living.
  \c06Duadhe Mahdi'in\c00  - The Water Seekers are good scouts and escorts.
 They know
			     the land they travel, especially where to find the right
			     spots for rest sites; places close to food and water.
  \c02Far Dareis Mai\c00   - Maidens of the Spear is the only Society a woman
 may
			     join. However, she would not want to join any other.
			     This Society is filled with camaraderie and good times,
			     though almost all of this is hidden from the others in
			     the Nation. Aside from the True Bloods, the Maidens take
			     Honor most seriously. To a Maiden, you are wed to the Spear,
			     not any man. Maidens make great scouts, though among them,
			     there is much diversity of talent.
  \c14Siswai Aman\c00      - The Spears of the Dragon is not an actual Society,
 but
			     it is what the Aiel who wear headbands with the Aes Sedai
			     symbol have named themselves. Other Aiel refuse to acknowledge
			     it, preferring to think of the Aiel in question as still part
			     of his older Society. Not a single Maiden will join, as they
			     already hold the Car'a'carn's honor, something the Siswai
			     hunger for. A Siswai'aman is someone who has grown to be
			     feverent in wanting to honor Rand al'Thor.
  \c11Mera'din\c00         - Not a Society either, this is what an Aiel is
 known as when
			     he or she loses or quits a Society. Many such Brotherless have
 			     now joined the Shaido because their Societies refused to let
			     them go as honorable Aiel.

The societies, as do all Aiel, follow the code of Ji'e'toh, and none
kill without raising their black veils.

AJAH
The Aes Sedai Ajahs
===================
        There are seven Ajahs among the Aes Sedai, which are similar to 
societies, designated by colour.  All Aes Sedai but the Amyrlin Seat belong
to one, and each follows a specific philosophy of th euse of the One Power, 
and the purposes of Aes Sedai.  The definitions of these Ajahs is as follows:
     The \c01Red\c00 Ajah -- bends its energies to finding men who can channel,
                     and to gentling them (cutting them off from the One
                     Power forever).  They see this as the only way to
                     prevent another Breaking of the World.  Reds usually
                     dislike or hate men and hence do not bond Warders.
     The \c10Brown\c00 Ajah -- forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself 
to
                     seeking knowledge, lost artifacts and books.  They
                     try to rediscover the knowledge lost during the
                     Breaking, the Trolloc Wars and other catastrophes
                     of the world.  Browns are usually quite dreamy and
                     tend to suffer from a short attention span.  They
                     believe in bonding only one Warder at a time.
     The \c07White\c00 Ajah -- eschews the world and the value of worldly
                     knowledge, devoting itself to questions of truth and  
                     philosophy.  Whites tend to be cold, calm, logical,    
                     aloof and stoic.  They bond only one Warder at a time.  
    The \c02Green\c00 Ajah -- holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai'don (the Last 
                     Battle).  Often called the Battle Ajah, the Green  
                     Ajah fought alongside armies during the Trolloc  
                     Wars.  They tend to bond many Warders for extra
 protection.
     The \c14Grey\c00 Ajah -- devotes itself to mediation, seeking harmony and
                     consensus among all things. They tend to negotiate
                     between nations and the White Tower, and they bond
                     only one Warder at a time.
     The \c03Yellow\c00 Ajah -- are Healers.  Yellows bend their energies to
 the
                     study of Healing, and tend to be the best among all
                     Aes Sedai.  They constantly try to find new ways to
                     Heal things, and bond only one Warder at a time.
     The\c04 Blue\c00 Ajah -- involves itself with causes and justice.  Blue
                     sisters are sometimes single-minded, and will often    
                     meddle in the affairs of nations.  They bond only one 
                     Warder at a time.
Among the Tower Aes Sedai there are currently no Blue sisters, as
all of them fled to Salidar when Siuan Sanche was deposed and Stilled.
Among the Salidar Aes Sedai there are currently no Red sisters, as none
fled with the rebels.

BTELL BDISPLAY BSHOW BDELETE BREPLY

Tells are a good thing, but sometimes they are lost. When the receiver is 
fighting, or mailing/writing for instance. To deal with this problem, tells
received in these situations are buffered. Up to 20 tells can be buffered
at one time. If you have tells in your buffer a (B) will appear at your 
prompt. Use bdisplay to see how many tells you have, and who they're from.

Ex: 
 > (B) bdispl
Tell [ 0]: from Atriau
Tell [ 1]: from Sorilea

etc...

To read a certain buffered tell, use bshow. 

Usage: bshow <number>
Ex: 
> (B) bshow 1
Sorilea told you: Hi, wassup?

To reply to a buffered tell, use breply. 

Usage: breply <number> <your reply>

Ex:
> (B) breply 1 Nothing much, and you?
You tell Sorilea 'Nothing much, and you?'

Last, to delete a buffered tell, use bdelete:

Usage: bdelete <number>

Ex: 
> (B) bdelete 1

BTOWER BT ASHA'MAN AM

Asha'man, the name given to followers of the Dragon Reborn, 
men who have come to what is now being called the Black Tower 
in order to learn how to channel. Some have dreamed of channeling 
despite all the dire risks, while others remain only because passing 
the test for the ability to learn has itself started them on the road 
to channeling, and they now must learn to control it before it kills 
them. They train not only in using the One Power, but also in the use 
of the sword and in fighting with hands and feet. Unlike Aes Sedai, who 
go to great lengths to make sure that those they train are not allowed 
to move dangerously fast, the Asha'man are pushed hard from the beginning, 
most especially in learning to use the Power's violent aspect. It is 
expected that a certain number of Asha'man will die or be burned out 
attempting to learn.  Bred to be honed weapons of destruction, the 
Asha'man are surely a force to be reckoned with. 

\c03All Asha'man seekers please read:\c06  AMSEEK1\c00
\c03All non-Asha'man seekers please read:\c06 BTSEEK1\c00

AMSEEK1

The first step in molding a character into an Asha'man seeker is to 
first determine what type of channeler you are.  Statistically the 
teachable channeler makes up just about ninety-nine percent of the male 
channeling populace and due to the fact that the RP is more complex for 
a Spark, it is suggested that anyone who is a beginner to RP as well as 
channeling, play a teachable.

\c05Teachable Channelers\c00 - These men have the innate ability to be 
taught how to grasp, and then how to channel. Without assistance, they 
will never come to know or use the powers bestowed upon them by the Creator.

\c05Spark Channelers\c00 - There are a very few who are born with the ability 
to touch the True Source whether they wish it or not, though even they 
require teaching to use their gift fully. These men are known as being 
born with the spark. While typically stronger in potential strength than 
others, their ability without training is minimal. Channeling without 
training is extremely dangerous to your health and causes many side 
effects. Under no circumstances may you role-play a seeker born with 
the spark or having been sparked, without the guildleader's permission. 
Requirements include an extensive knowledge of channeling mechanics as 
well as adequate role-play ability.

AMSEEK2

The next step is creating an appropriate background story. It should and 
will make up the brunt of your seeker application e-mail. A background is 
the story about the character's past and present. It can also include as 
much relevant information about your character as possible. Please be 
sure to include the answer to the following questions.  They serve only 
to guide, not to limit.

-  How old are you?
-  Where are you from?
-  What about your family and childhood?
-  Do/did you have a job?
-  What are your feelings about other groups and why?
-  What do you believe in?
-  What are your goals in life?
-  What are your views on Rand al'Thor?
  
\c03Please proceed to: \c06AMSEEK3\c00

AMSEEK3

After creating an appropriate background story for your character, the 
next step is to create a list of weaknesses and strengths your character 
possesses. This is in regards any quality or attribute of your character 
that defines him. For every strength you give your character, apply a 
weakness of the same intensity. Your character's background story might 
very well prove to be the inspiration of many of these characteristics. 
The end result should be a more realistic, complex, and balanced character 
than from what you started with. As many merits and flaws for your character 
as your imagination permits are welcome. 

\c03Please proceed to: \c06AMSEEK4\c00

AMSEEK4

Now that you have a background story and a list of flaws and strengths, 
we must define how it would be that your character might find himself 
recruited by the Black Tower. There are two types of recruitment 
strategies employed by the M'Hael and the Black Tower: The Lord 
Dragon's Amnesty and Active Recruiting. 

\c05Amnesty\c00 -  The Lord Dragon issued a general amnesty to all male 
channelers in Caemlyn, the capital of Andor, a city supervised by 
Rand al'Thor.  This amnesty, or pardon, purged all crimes a male 
channeler might have committed, and offers sanctuary to those whom 
would normally be fatally scrutinized by society. The only fact about 
the amnesty that is clear is that it reigns over Caemlyn. All else is 
shrouded in mystery.

\c05Active Recruiting\c00 - Active Recruiting is a strategy invented and 
implemented by Mazrim Taim. It involves parties of Asha'man approaching
villages of all shapes and sizes, all over the world, to recruit young 
men of a suitable age to fight for the Lord Dragon.  What this commitment 
truly entails is, however, unknown to the individual involved.

The reasons for both seeking the amnesty and joining up with an 
active recruitment session are very similar. Among them include 
but are not limited to: Pride, fame, poverty, curiosity, hope, 
desperation, and bravery.

ANGREAL SA'ANGREAL

  Angreals and Sa'angreals are items from the Age of Legends, with which
a channeler might use more of the One Power, than he/she could manage
unaided. A sa'angreal is more or less a 'beefed up' version of Angreals.
  The making of Angreals and San'greals have been lost since the Age of
Legends, along with most of those items as well.
  Some *greals will work only for men, others only for women, and
according to legends there might even be those who works as well both for
men as for women.
  *greals today are rare, and sought after by the Aes Sedai, who consider
ALL objects of the One Power to be rightful property of the White Tower,
so should you find one, keep it a secret, if you wish to keep it.
  As *greals works in the WoT-books, we have tried to make them similar
here on DF. This means, that a strong channeler will get much more
mana-increase, than a weak channeler. As example, we have the two
channelers Otto and Harald. Now, otto has mana at 300, while Harald is
very mighty with his 2000 mana.
  With the same Angreal, Otto might gain an 150 additional mana, while
Harald will gain an additional 1000. (Hope you see the pattern here ;))

TWARDERS

   The Warders belong to an elite group of fighters called the Gaidin,
in the Old Tongue meaning Brothers to Battle. Together with the Aes
Sedai, \c01bonded\c00 to them through a mystical process of the One
Power, they will die to protect their bondmate.
   Tradition had the Gaidin train their skills in the \c14White Tower\c00 in
Tar Valon. There in the yards the instructors would take young men who
came to be trained by them and teach the way of the sword to a great
extent - the result being the finest trained warriors anywhere. Lessons
will include the blade, but also alternative weapons, survival skills,
everything to assist the Warders in the lifetime of service to the Aes
Sedai against the Dark One, preparing for the Tarmon Gai'don, the Last
Battle.
   Recently, there was a coup in the White Tower; the Gaidin following
the breaking of the Tower were also split in two groups, a number of them
following the Rebel Aes Sedai to Salidar. The relation between them has
never been clear; indeed before the late events there hadn't been a
recorded incident of Warders fighting against Warders.
   A number of young noblemen trained by the Gaidin led by \c01Gawyn
 Trakand\c00,
the First Prince of the Sword of Andor has formed the \c01Younglings\c00; this
highly efficient division of the White Tower, still obedient and bound to
service to the Aes Sedai has often expressed its unwillingness to follow
orders by them, lacking trust for the Servants, but has yet to lose in
battle even when facing the Aiel - the combination of mounted combat
tactics and the Gaidin training making them all but invincible.
   The \c14Bond\c00 forged between a Warder and his Aes Sedai gives him
abilities beyond those of the normal man. He can take far greater amounts
of physical damage than a normal man and survive, his wounds heal a lot
faster, he can sense Shadowspawn and some servants of the Dark One from a
distance, and he can feel what his bondmate can at all times, along with
her exact location in relation to him.
   When a Warder's Aes Sedai dies, he feels the exact time, and manner of
her death. His will to live dies with him; most Warders will die avenging
their bondmate's deaths, or will seek out impossible odds even they can't
face and live. It is said the Warder is dead inside then.

To join the Tower Warders, read the requirements on the Guild Req board
at the Recall point in Caemlyn.

ARMOUR

  No sane warrior goes to battle without some kind of protection. This
protection is symbolized as Armor Class (AC) and Absorption (Abs).
  AC determines whether you get hit or not, and you have 100 armour if
you're totally unprotected. The lower the AC, the better; you can have
as low an AC as -200, at which virtually none hits you.
  Absorption determines how much damage is taken by the armor before you
take damage yourself. You start with 0 Abs, and can get as high as 400.
This figure is the amount in -tenths of a point- damage, so if you have
100 Abs, your armor absorbs 10 points of damage.
There are also weaves available to channelers which enhance the AC and Abs.

BALEFIRE

History:  Balefire's nature requires constant attention, and rigid
guidelines in its usage -- hence this policy. To ensure it is used
properly, and an unbiased decision is made to protect all characters
present in the role-play, as well as maintaining realism, all usage of
balefire must pass through both the Council.  Balefire is only woven by
Rand somewhat actively. All Forsaken have the knowledge but are somewhat
still held by the unspoken agreement in the War of Power to withhold
balefire from the war. It is proven by Shai'tan's simple question to
Demandred, "Will you wield the balefire in my service, Demandred?" As it
states, most forsaken should -not- be using balefire under most
circumstances. 

Usage:  There are only a select few that have the knowledge to weave
balefire, and it  should remain that way for the most part.

Who:  Sammael, Demandred, Osan'gar, Aran'gar, Moridin, Semirhage,
Graendal, Cyndane, Moghedien, Morraine, Rand.

Immediate Authorization:  Any of the characters that wish to use balefire
in a role-play they are currently in must contact a Councilor that is
online at the time. The Councilor will be trusted for the most part to
make the right decision, and they are given the responsibility to give it
a yay or nay.  In the event that a Councilor is not on during this time,
to ensure the security this policy gives, and not to bog us with the
nulling of role-play, balefire may not be used. 

Checks & Balances:  For the Councilor who made the decision, it is his or
her's responsibility to mail to the DFCouncil list all information
regarding the request, and the reasons for his or her decision. To null
the role-play, an agreement of three of the four Councilors not involved
in the situation, one of the three having to be the Head Councilor. 

Exceptions:  As in every policy, there are always exceptions. All requests
are to be mailed to the Council Mailing List (dfcouncil@egroups.com),
and voted upon in a quorum.

BAND REDHAND BOTRH

       The story of the Band of the Red Hand has lived on since the time
of the Trolloc Wars. The legendary army was the last to fall in the final
defense of Manetheren and King Eamon himself, their defeat signifying the
collapse of that great nation.
       The name has been taken on by a new army. This new Band was formed
when Matrim Cauthon saved a group of soldiers who otherwise would have
died in a battle against the Shaido Aiel in Cairhien. Mat is now known as
one of the greatest tactical minds of this, or perhaps any other time, as
his planning reflects a style not seen since the Trolloc Wars, and the
Band has not suffered one defeat under his leadership.
       Another thing the Band's success has been attributed to is Mat's
incredible luck. He is ta'veren, and has been known to win almost without
fail at dice, or any game of chance.
       The Band is made up of 6 divisions: Infantry (or Swordsmen),
Pikemen, Cavalry, Crossbows, Medics and Scouts. The Band's main strength
is teamwork, both in combat and out. Although the Band is based mainly in
Salidar now, Mat has been known to call a move on a whim, and within a
very short time the camp is packed up and ready to move.
       As the original basis of the Band was a number of soldiers from
Cairhien and Tear, the Band now accepts recruits from all nationalities,
as long as they are willing to fight amongst a group considered sworn to
the Dragon.

BANDREQS
       The Band of the Red Hand guild is RP based at it's camp near
Salidar in Altara. All races, sexes and classes are welcomed, however the
Band is an army, and is not suited to Wilder or Channeler class. Those who
choose to RP channeling ability openly will be sent on to the appropriate
guild via RP (either Rebel Aes Sedai for females, or Asha'man for males).
       The Band is an RP guild, and all recruitments will be based on a
suitable level of roleplay with current guild members. New recruits must
be at level 20 at the time they join the guild.

BANDRANKS

       Here is a list and brief description of the Band's main ranks:

- Probation
   This is reserved for those who for one reason or another are in poor
   standing within the Band. Members receiving severe disciplinary action
   will be placed in this rank until their punishment is completed, before
   being restored to their previous rank. Whilst on probation, Band 
   members lose all previous rights and responsibilties.

- Recruit
   This is the entry-level rank for all new guild members. Upon becoming a
   Recruit, you will be handed a tabard bearing the symbol of the Band, so
   that other guild members will be able to easily identify those who may
   need training or guidance.
   Recruits also receive the Band's Banner, and standard issue boots.

- First Rank:
   Each of the 6 divisions of the Band has the same number of ranks, and
   many ranks share the same name across divisons. The First Rank of a
   division is where Recruits will be promoted to once they have
   completed their training and chosen their division.
                DIVISION                FIRST RANK
                ========                ==========
                Cavalry                 Horseman
                Swordsmen               Swordsman
                Pikemen                 Pikeman
                Crossbowmen             Crossbowman
                Medics                  Healer

   The Scouts are secretive about their rank structure, even within the
   band. As the Band's scouts are the best you are likely to find, they
   deserve your respect no matter their rank.

- Further ranks.
   The further promotional ranks for the divisions are mostly the same,   
   except for a few differences within the Medics. The ranks follow 
   this structure:
                STANDARD RANK           MEDICS
                =============           ======
                Veteren                 Medic
                Bannerman               Chirirgeon
                Fileleader              Field Doctor
                Captain                 Captain

- Commander
   There is only one Commander of each division.

- General
   This rank is highest within the guild, and is reserved for Matrim
   Cauthon.

       These are the main ranks you will encounter within the Band of the
Red Hand guild. There are a number of other ranks, but it should not be
difficult to see how these fit in.

There is also a number of subranks for the Band, some of which are:

- Redarm
   The Redarms are the Band's internal police, and Redarm duty is
   rotated through every member of the Band. This way, not many will make
   things difficult for the Redarms, since sooner or later, the favour may
   be returned.

- Instructor
   There will be Intructors within each division who's job it is to teach
   new First Rankers the way of their chosen profession, as well as 
   providing higher ranked soldeirs with ways of keeping in practice.

- Master of Recruits
   Essentially the Head Instructor for Recruits, it is their job to keep
   tabs on new recruits and their progress through the lessons.

      Again, you will encounter other subranks, but they should not be
difficult to understand.

BANDRP

This file explains the way the different ranks within the Band interact
with each other.

First and foremost, the Band is a unit.  Their strength is in working
together.  In general, and when there is no danger, all members of the
Band are equal.  No rank is to be pulled unless it is ESSENTIAL that
someone take charge.  If this circumstance arises, then Band members
default to following the orders of the highest ranked Band member there.
The Band member of highest rank will then be responsible for what happens.

UNDER _NO_ CIRCUMSTANCES IS A BAND MEMBER TO PULL RANK ON
SOMEONE ELSE FOR A FRIVOLITY!

This rule cannot be stressed enough.  Sending a lower ranked Band member to
get someone else for important business is necessary.  Sending them to get
your food or wash your clothes is NOT!  This goes for all situations.  If
you see this happening or are the victim of it, talk to Mat and he will
take care of it.  Persistent or major misuse of rank within the Band will
result in being placed on probation with a possible demotion.

The only wierd situation is someone who is on probation.  While on probation,
a Band member loses all rights and priviledges and must default to the
person of highest rank, regardless of what they were before.

Now that that's out of the way, here's how it goes rp-wise.

Lower ranked Band members should respect the higher ranked ones for their
experience and ability.  They should want to learn from the people of
higher rank.  Remember: they can teach you a lot about war, tactics, weapon
handling, and being a Band member.

Higher ranked Band members should take lower ones under wing and help them
out if possible.  Tell them of your experiences, teach them some of the
finer points of warfare and weapon handling.  Tell them what they are good
at and what they should work on.  But be a friend, not a parent.  You're all
in this together, and even the General goes out and has a fun night of
gambling with his men now and again.  ;)

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

BOND

Usage: BOND <playername>

This command bonds a person as your Warder, Wife, or Minion, permanently.
By doing this, you get access to the bond channels, BDT, AMT, or MDT, depending
on the type of Bond, as well as the command bondsense.

Bonding is a One Power weave of the five flows, one that was invented not in
the Age of Legends as most spells were, but in the resurrection of the strength
of the White Tower. It places a link between the two minds of the bonder and
bondee, not telekinesis (talking on the channels is OOC), but in sensing
emotion and location of the other directly bonded. It is possible for th
bonder to bond more than one person, though these bonded cannot feel each
 other,
only the bonder. More recently, the Asha'man have learned a form of the long
known Bonding of the Sedai. It does not work quite the same; the Sedai bond
gives their Warders increased stamina and eyesight and decreased sense of pain.
For the wives and the Asha'man, it is a duller bond that is only sensory. The
Forsaken are also able to bond, but theirs is strictly OOC to allow them to
speak to their minions.

Losing a Bond is usually violent. A way to safely remove a bond is possible but
only by those truly knowledgeable in bonding - currently only the Aes Sedai.
A snapped Bond happens either when one of the two dies, or when the bonder is
stilled. In this case, the bondee has it harder than the bonder. The bondee
will feel the whiplash like a huge snap in his head, and if he does not die
immediately, he will fall into deep depression and, most often, grow cold and
try to kill himself one way or another. The best way to curb this is to rebond
him to try and fill the void of the old bond. Similarly, the bonder will feel
depression, just not as strong, and can almost always live with the loss.

BUILDING BUILDER

Building is a simple process of using your imagination to create the cities,
wilderness, inns, and other areas that the players may explore. Although
time consuming and sometimes difficult when balancing equipment and mobs,
a Builder's job can be very rewarding when people move into it in order
to roleplay or just enjoy the things built within. Here at Dragon's Fang
a new builder is not required to already know how to build and utilize the
Online Creation, but it does help. Knowledge of the book series The Wheel
Of Time, however, is necessary.

\c09"Building sounds cool! How do I sign up?"\c00
The requirments for Builder include knowledge of the books, ability to be
online and meet deadlines, and good writing skill. If you wish to apply
for a Builder position, send a mail to the Headbuilder with the following
information:
1. Your name, age, and timezone
2. Any characters you play on Dragon's Fang
3. Amount of time you have mudded, here and elsewhere.
4. Any previous imm and builder experience.
5. Extent of book knowledge.
6. Areas you most like to build (ie: roads, wilderness, cities, oceans)
7. (\c01IMPORTANT\c00) Two WoT areas you are most interested in.
8. A sample of three room descriptions, completely your choice.

The Headbuilder is \c05Purdan\c00, and the application email is:
 fangbuilder@hotmail.com\c00

\c14NOTE:\c00 We are hiring as many temporary builders as we can, no experience
required, to help rebuild the world for the future opening of the new Dragon's
Fang. Although we cannot give real immortals to these temp builders, we greatly
appreciate their help and will give them both zone recognition and game
reimbursement for their time and effort. Zones that need builders include most
of the world, such as Emond's Field, Caemlyn and other Andoran regions, Fal
Moran, Shadar Logoth, Plain of Lances, Seafolk isles, Illian, and Braem Wood.
If you are interested, mail us!

"CHILDREN OF THE LIGHT" COTL WC WHITECLOAKS

The Children of the Light.


  A strict order, whose vows are for life, \c07The Children of the Light \c00
follow their interpretation of the Light, as written by Lothair
Mantelar, in his book, "The Way of the Light". Some people think
that they are too fanatical, too strict, too overbearing, (putting
it lightly), with their views. They do believe that they follow
the True Light, and all others, if not out and out darkfriends,
are not as pure, as Illuminated, so to speak, as they.

  Whereas some CotL are the fanatical, overbearing, vicious types,
there are some that believe truly in the calling that turned them
to the CotL, and while they still can be ruthless about their beliefs,
they take a while longer to turn to the violent methods.

There are two factions within the Children of the Light:
       \c07The Children, \c00and the \c01Inquisitors.\c00

\c07The Children \c00are the soldier types.
   The CotL have a strict chain of command, and orders are expected
to be carried out immediately, if not sooner. If there is some delay,
the under Child will be suspected of "straying from the Light."
Children refer to other CotL, who are ranked under them, as "Child".
Higher ranks are referred to by their ranks. A strict militaristic
group, the CotL are the soldiers of the Children of the Light, and
make up the majority of the members.

\c01The Inquisitors.\c00
   Officially, "The Hand of the Light", the inquisitors are the members
of the CotL as a whole, but somewhat seperate. The Hand of the Light,
(HotL), are the ones that have, more than anything, made the Children
a feared presence. They "question" suspected Darkfriends. They use
instruments of torture to bring the suspected Darkfriend to the Light,
"knowing" the answer before the Question is given.
   Most, if not all of them think that they are doing the True Work of
the Light, and are therefore superior to the soldiers of the Children.

\c06Guild requirements\c00

Level 20, no exceptions.
Must be a non channeler. No exceptions.
2 sponsors from already guilded members.
A working knowledge of the books is a bonus.

CLASS CLASSES
You can be one of seven classes at creation:

\c02Adventurer:\c00 A person of great skill when it comes to fighting abilities
            and wildlife survival, he is one of the sturdiest and most
            versatile classes on Dragon's Fang. Available early on to
            him are many fighting skills and equivalent.

\c02Soldier:\c00 A person used to living a fighting life, this is the class
            that has the most fighting skills available to him the earliest.
            He is very skilled in many martial arts (No, not Karate and such!)

\c02Craftsman:\c00 A person not that skilled at fighting, he/she is the only
            one skilled at retooling.

\c02Thief:\c00 Someone adept in the areas of the rogue: Stealing, sneaking,
            hiding and backstabbing in dark alleys ;), he is also very
            good at finding other thieves.

\c02Wisdom:\c00 A wisdom is normally a village wise woman with many skills
            in herblore, healing, judging differences among village
            members and governing the village as a whole. She is not at
            all adept in fighting, but has many other aces up her sleeve.

\c02Wilder:\c00 A person who has learned all by herself to channel, and if not
            helped he will most certainly die a painful death or burn
            himself out. One of the classes who at creation can wield the
            One Power at will.

\c02Channeler:\c00 A person who can be trained to use the One Power if
            he/she ever gets the proper education. Due to the power of
            the Channelers and the Wilders, they are given limited access
            to fighting skills to not overturn the balance of the mud.

CLUBS CLUBTALK

Clubs are small player run and owned clans with as much or as little IC basis
as the players themselves wish to give. A player is able to be accepted into
just one club at a time; to leave he must either be removed by the Leader of
the club, or have his club cleared by an immortal. Clubs currently are
available to anyone who wishes one - any immortal can set someone the Leader
of one - though you should have people to add if you do make one.

Though it is not possible to see who all is in your club, you can see who
online is in your club by typing \c09who -m\c00.

You can also speak to online members of your club using \c01clubtalk\c00.

COLORSETTING

   There are two ways to add colours to your output, description and objects:
\c01   a)\c00
   You simply type \c directly followed by any of these numbers:

        Normal text      Bold text    Backgrounds
        ===========      =========    ===========
Red         01              08            15
Green       02              09            16
Yellow      03              10            17
Blue        04              11            18
Magenta     05              12            19
Cyan        06              13            20
White       07              14            21
Dark gray   22              23            24

And -\c02don't\c00- forget to "close" the colors off afterwards!
Otherwise the colors will "bleed" into other text.
The closing-off symbol is for all codes \c directly followed by 00

\c01   b)\c00
   There is also another way to use colours , using the & symbol exactly 
like the \c sign (using &n to "close" it so that it won't "leak") :

COUNCIL
A Council of 3 imms has been formed to help uphold and
enforce the \c03Policy \c00(type '\c03policy\c00'), and to act as
a mediator between IC and OOC problems or issues.

Some examples that would fall into our category include, but are
not limited to, the following:

- *Any* issue that involves the \c03Policy \c00(type '\c03policy\c00'). This
  includes multiplaying, harrassment, and OOC stealing and tooling.

- IC conflicts such as determining the winner of a roleplay fight.

- OOC conflicts such as using OOC info or bug abuse.

There are numerous conflicts/issues/problems/arguments that
should be brought to our attention. Mail us with the issue and we
will question both sides before making a decision.

If you are unsure whether you should bring the issue to us, do
the safe thing and just do it; we are here to help.

Please send a tell or mail to any or all Council members with
your questions/conflicts/issues. Like I stated earlier, we are
here to help.

The current Councilors are: \c03Geoffrey, Valaire, Reiten\c00

DAES DAE'MAR GAME

Otherwise known as the Great Game of Houses or simply as the Great Game 
and in the Old Tongue, Daes Dae'mar.  It is the scheming, plots and 
manipulations for advantage by noble Houses.  Great value is given to 
subtlety, to aiming at one thing while seeming to aim at another, and 
to achieving ends with the least visible effort.
All nations play the Great Game, some more than others.  The Cairhien 
country plays the Game to its highest art form.  That is not to say 
there are not players of the Game that are just as good as those found 
in Cairhien, but rather as a group the Cairhienans play the best.  Even 
the servants in Cairhien play their own version of the Game.  Andorans 
are the reluctant players, playing the Game when it is necessary.  The 
Borderlands are at the opposite end of the spectrum, considering 
themselves above the Game and maintain that they do not play.  The key 
is to appear as if one is not playing a game.  To say and do things 
with hints to other things make Daes Dae'mar an art form, but to 
misinterpret those subtleties can mean death.
     Below are listed a few of the tools used in the Great Game.  It is 
by no means an exhaustive list.  You are limited only by your 
imagination.

\c12Rumors:\c00  Rumors are an important tool in the Great Game.  The 
problem with Rumors is that they tend to have a life of their own and 
you can lose control over them.  Of course, if you are using rumors to 
undermine the integrity of others then the more out of control the 
rumor becomes the better.  However, if your goal is to spread 
misinformation you may want more control over the rumor.  One way to do 
this is to hire people to spread rumors.  There are a few rules about 
rumors you need to understand.  One being that to be effective, the 
source of the rumor should never be revealed.  In fact, it could be 
quite dangerous to you if it were found out.  Sometimes, it is better 
to have house servants such as advisors or loyal guards be the one who 
pays off others for the spreading of rumors.  One of the best ways to 
spread rumors is through the gleemen or any person who tends to travel 
a lot.  If you know the spies of others make sure the rumors are passed 
along to them as well.

\c12Bribes:\c00  Bribes are an important part of the Great Game and 
they do not have to be just in terms of money.  You can bribe with 
anything.extraordinary weapons, women - including marriage proposals 
or their hands in marriage, which is fairly easy to do if the women are 
part of your house and you are a noble, positions, wine, or various 
other favors.  It is of course important never to call these bribes, 
but rather little presents of appreciation for a job well done.  
Semantics is so very critical to a good play of the Game.

\c12Codes:\c00  Nobles are supposed to excel at writing coded messages.  
For this to work, the party you are sending the message to has to know 
how to uncode it.  Although, Jordan never states it, probably each 
house has its own code that changes as it is found out by others.  That 
code would be taught to all the house members unless a house member 
were left out due to suspicion of spying or leaking information from 
the House.  In addition, it is also likely that people who are working 
closely together would develop some way to code messages among 
themselves.  Please note, that using codes is something only nobles do 
among other nobles not servants or guards (unless the guard is also a 
noble).  You have two options.  One options is to literally develop a 
code, which is best because it takes role play to sit down and work out 
a system you can use between the parties involved.  The other options 
is to simply put at the top of the letter: this letter is written in 
code known only by other nobles of house Damodred.  And to put that 
line between astrids.  The only problem is that if any one reads it, 
while they can't claim in character knowledge, they will have OOC 
knowledge.  Codes can be a lot of fun and are used way too little.  And 
thieves should be stealing more mail than they do, cause it is often 
worth more than any gold the person might be carrying.

\c12Spies and informants:\c00  These are essential to a good play of 
the Game.  In fact, they are essential even if you supposedly don't 
play the Game.  Spies and informants are secret, they never call 
themselves that, probably not even to you.  They gather information and 
pass it on.  They can be from your House, or from other Houses, or from 
any segment of society.  Sometimes, just advertising for guards will 
get you information as you interview each potential candidate.  The 
best informant is the one that doesn't know he/she is informing.  There 
are lots of ways to get information and they don't have to be on your 
payroll.  The danger is you usually don't know the reliability of the 
information you are getting, even the person giving it to you might not 
know how reliable it is.  There is always the possibility that no 
matter how loyal your informant is to you, that they might be getting 
fed misinformation.  While not all gleeman are informants per se, it is 
always useful to have a court bard in the house for entertainment among 
other things.

\c12Aes Sedai:\c00 The Aes Sedai are useful for information and 
protection.  Aes Sedai usually have their own system of eyes and ears 
and can be helpful with the information they have.  Aes Sedai can also 
offer you protection.  Many Nobles have hired Aes Sedai to join their 
courts, though often they do not realize they are adding themselves as 
strings to the game the Amyrlin plays.  However, they can be great 
assets.  For instance, if you are fortunate enough to get a Yellow 
Ajah, then you get the bonus of having someone who can heal you as 
well, and this can come in handy.

\c12Blackmail:\c00  Blackmail, making someone pay you to not reveal 
information is quite dangerous and a highly lucrative endeavor.  This 
one is often employed in the case of channeling, and the person pays 
for your silence.  You have to make sure you don't ask for more than 
the person can pay and you must not tell anyone.  If you violate either 
of these rules then the chances are very good that the person will try 
to kill you.  To make yourself more valuable and the money they are 
paying you seem worth it to them, you can always use whatever means you 
have to offer them some level of protection.  This is not necessary but 
it can lower the likelihood they will seek to terminate you.  And don't 
limit your blackmailing to mere coinage.be creative.

\c12Kidnapping and hostage taking:\c00  Often times, it is best to have 
someone else do the actual kidnapping for you and even better if the 
kidnapped person never knows of you or sees your face.  When it comes 
time for release, be the person who tries to rescue them.  Of course, 
there are a number of variations on this theme.  If you are one of 
those evil doers and you want to put the fear of the Dark One into your 
enemies then by all means let them know . Indeed flaunt your evil 
deeds before them all, the whole nation or world.  In fact, even if you 
didn't kidnap someone take credit for it, come forward and say you have 
them.  It will increase your prestige and you may even get the money or 
other items the actual kidnapper was hoping to obtain.

DDREQS

Life is a game. The object of the game is to stay on top of a
dangerous and ever changing world. This is done by many methods:  
bribery, cohersion, kidnapping, assassination, marriage, poisoning, and 
many other dirty tricks. The people who play this game either have 
shady ethics and ideals or do what it takes to win, caring little for 
who stands in their way. This is Daes Dae'mar, the Game of Houses.

Daes Dae'mar is a guild where you deal your hand and hope you
become the game master, not the pawn. The nobility varies greatly in 
power and status, but all hold a single goal: the wish to excel in 
politics and power. There are also the guards of the city or Houses, 
merchants, spies, even lowly stablehands, maids, and serving wenches. 
You can also dabble in the court system as a Magistrate or Thieftaker.  
If high adventure is your thing, you may even try your hand as a Hunter 
of the Horn.

All seekers must be at least LEVEL 20 and must send a background with a 
life story to DAES GL and must RP with other members of  the guild (who 
in turn MUST send an RP report to the Guildleader).  The number of 
sponsors necessary to be guilded changes with each seeker.  It depends 
on the RP and how you are rated by the guildmembers, the position you 
seek, and the House/Nation you are seeking. 

Channelers are allowed into the guild by petition and must submit a 
complete backgroud and IC training to the GL. In addition, the guild 
maintains a ratio of channelers to non-channelers.  It is very likely 
you will have to wait for an opening.  Filling of openings are NOT on a 
first come first serve bases.  The openings will be filled by the best 
Role Player among those waiting for guilding.  Playing a Channeler in 
Daes is a very delicate matter, and we wish to have people playing 
these characters to understand the IC conditions in which they play.  
Therefore we ask this extra measure be taken.

Daes Dae'mar is first and foremost a Roleplay guild, and we expect our 
players to excel in RP ability, not just code. The weapon of choice in 
Daes is subtlety and guile. Even the most lowly servant can influence 
the workings of nations. Do not let someone's station deceive you.  You 
never know who has influence upon who, or what their intentions are.

People wishing to play Nobles must post a detailed Character Background 
and have the sponsorship of the Head of the House they seek. The 
background should be very detailed and demonstrate that you have an 
understanding of the political climate of the house you are applying to 
as well as an understanding of being a noble.  The standards are quite 
high, do not be surprised if your initial background is rejected.  The
GL is always willing to work with potential seekers.  Players who have 
played a lower rank in the Daes guild tend to be the most successful 
petitioners because they have experience and understanding having 
played in the guild.

DAMANE
Literally, leashed-one.
  The girls born with the ability to channel are collared by the Sul'dam.
They are like dogs, controlled by a sul'dam with an a'dam (see HELP A'DAM).
They are used as weapons, using the One Power in battles.
  Depending on the talents of the Damanes, they can be trained to find
precious minerals for the Seanchan, to make a'dams, or any other tasks that
can be executed only with the One Power.  To be touched by a Damane is a
dishonor, except for the Sul'dams.  They are feared because of their power,
but beside from that, they are seen as less than human by the Seanchan.
The Damanes are the property of the Empress.  They can not do anything
without the Sul'dam's permission.  They possess nothing.  Damanes are
possessions. Most Damanes are not allowed names.

INNS TAVERNS

   Inns and taverns are placed in various places in all the lands, where
travellers can buy food and provisions or a place to spend the night.
Traditionally used as good role-playing spots, players can stay undisturbed
in private rooms, or join as groups in the common areas to hold meetings
or celebrations.

DARKFRIEND

  Darkfriend, Friends of the Dark, the Shadowsouled, Nightrunners, they have
been called by many names by many people, but they all mean the same thing:
Someone who has forsaken the light and pledged their soul and lives to
serve the Shadow. It is not easy for many people to understand why someone
would want to become a Darkfriend, but there are many possible explanations.
One possibility is that these people are seduced by promises of \c03wealth\c00,
\c02power\c00 and even \c06immortality\c00 for their service to the Dark One.
 Others are
perhaps castoffs from society, and seek revenge against those who scorned
them, or perhaps some are forced to serve the shadow against their will,
and eventually are mired so deep that they cannot escape. Yet despite the
methods that have brought about their oaths to the dark, we can suspect that
they have served well, for the Dark One has never been a lenient master.

There is little that is truly known about those who have pledged their lives
in service to the shadow, and much that is suspected. One thing that is
known, is that a darkfriend would rather die than betray their oaths, for it
is suspected that the Lord of the Grave has found some way to punish his
minions even beyond their own death. As for where darkfriends come from,
there has been much speculation, and little hard evidence. It seems that
anyone could be one of the Friends of the Dark, regardless of what country
they are from, or their social status, from king to beggar. Those people
who have admitted to being a darkfriend before they died, have come from
all lots in life, so it seems the Lord of the Grave will use anyone he can
to advance his goals.

            \c01<Requirements to become a Darkfriend>\c00

DFPOLICY

\c061)\c00    To join this guild you must be at least level 20.

\c062)\c00    Your Darkfriend character must have a story, background, and a
       description, in addition to some reason for joining the Dfguild.
       Basically the DF guild is a RP guild so you need to join for
       RP reasons.

\c063)\c00    To speak to other darkfriends use: dt <text>. Your message will
 be sent
       to all darkfriends who are logged onto the mud.
       NOTE: names will not be displayed with the message because
       dt is totally OOC.

\c064)\c00    If another character you know wants to become a darkfriend, and
 lets
       you know, inform the guildleader as soon
       as you can so they can be guilded.

\c065)\c00    If someone of a higher rank gives you an order, you must react to
 the
       order in a manner in keeping with your own standing with
       the Chosen, the Great Lord, the Hand of The Dark, and/or
       your relationship to the superiors of the person giving
       the orders.

\c066)\c00    If someone of a higher rank requests a report on your activities,
 you
       have the option of giving one, or not depending on the
       same circumstances listed in policy statement five.
       Likewise, you have the option in the degree of truth
       you give to your report, if you give one.

\c067)\c00    Your first responsibility and loyalty for your DF character
 shouldbe
       in keeping with the knowledge that disloyalty to the DFs
       can and usually does end with your character's death -
       but that it might not if you are shrewd enough.

\c068)\c00    Darkfriends can not automaticaly know what guild a person belongs
 to
       by their guild Equipment or other such clues, unless it is a really
       obvious affiliation such as Whitecloak battle armor, Gleeman patchwork
       cloak, and so forth. (Basically just use common sense)

\c069)\c00   You are allowed to join another guild (if you do not already
 belong
       to one) after you become a Darkfriend.

\c0610)\c00  If you are IC'ly known by a member to have betrayed the guild in
 some
       fashion, your Darkfriend character will almost certainly
       be killed in reprisal, unless someone powerful enough to
       save you comes to your aid.

\c0611)\c00  The only way to leave the guild is to be willing to ICly be a
 marked
       target for the rest of that character's IC existence.

\c0612)\c00  If you have an alt who is not in the Darkfriend guild, and use
       Darkfriend guild knowledge with that character, disciplinary action
       will be taken that is in keeping with the abuse of IC knowledge OOCly
       (for that is what you will have done).

\c0613)\c00  You will be expected to attend all Darkfriend guild meetings, and 
if
       you are unable to attend, please inform the guildleaders BEFORE the
       meeting.

\c0614)\c00  Darkfriend book characters will start with the level, rank,
 equipment,
       skills, weaves, money, and so forth that will be deemed appropriate
       by Shai'tan and Shaidar.

\c0616)\c00  Darkfriend book characters who are also a member of another guild 
can
       only be assigned by Shai'tan and Shaidar in conjunction with the
       other GL(s).

\c0617)\c00 If another character has proof that your character is a member of
       the Darkfriend guild, it will be an IC reason(in most cases) for them
       to try and kill your character, and it will also be a reason for
       other Dfs to kill you (again assuming that they gain IC knowledge
       that your character has been unmasked).

\c0618)\c00  Darkfriend guild members have the option of choosing Darkfriend
 guildeq
       or the guildeq of their regular guild (but only in such cases
       when the guildleader of their regular guild -also- allows this
       option). Guild skills will be restricted and given out on the
       basis of RP to the appriopriate ranks and -type- of ranks.

\c0619)\c00 Dreadlords may at no time teach skills to anyone other than
       Dreadlords. The only exception to this, is a Chosen may direct a
       Dreadlord to teach something to a Darkfriend. However, any such
       instant must be reported to a DF Guildleader and the logs of the
       roleplay(both the order and the lesson) emailed in(Note: emailed,
       mudmail is unacceptable), without exception. (The Chosen will
       also consult with the Master Dreadlord to determine whether the
       skill is permissable to allow a darkfriend/non DL to acquire).

DISCLAIMER

Alright, since this has to come someplace....

The owners, staff and hosters of this mud have no control over any
information being passed in the game, and hence have no possibility to
stop, censor or in any other way tamper with or identify any information
that may be passed via the game in any way, regardless of what the
purpose of said information might be.

Long sentence, eh? What it means is; We immortals have no clue what
people might type in private, unless we're snooping someone, something
we only do if we suspect someone of cheating, or if it's necessary to
help the person being snooped. Nor does anyone else, for that matter.

We don't save logs of what people do and say, only of some special
events, such as players gaining another level, dying, quitting, etc.

We can't, therefore, take any responsibility for what others 
might type, when in this game.

No matter what.

DRAGONS FANG MUD

The Dragons Fang is a mud based on Circle 3.0 bpl 11 and the book
series called the Wheel of Time, written by Robert Jordan. This is a
mud strongly encouraging roleplay [rp], and good roleplayers will be
rewarded by entrance in the various guilds lead by the guildleaders,
who are immortals.

The idea of this mud was basically worked out by the following people:
Stefan Lindstrom, Fredrik Lannergren and Erik Soderberg, but by now the
mud has swelled so much that no credit can be given them alone, but has
to be shared to all those involved with with this mud.

Should you have any ideas at all that you think would help us out in
this rather ardous work, we'd be happy to receive them. Who knows, if
you give enough good ideas, you might become an imm yourself!

DRAGONSWORN DS
The Dragonsworn are led in the field by the Prophet Masema Dagar and at the
camp by the Prophetess Kindrana.  All Dragonsworn spread the word of the
Dragon reborn throughout the lands, following his teachings.  Their only
 mission
is to spread that word and to convert others to their cause of the truth of
Rand al'Thor.  Their philosophy is simple: "The Dragon reborn is the only
salvation against the Dark One and his followers as the day of the Last Battle
approaches.  Those faithful to the Dragon have been known to be vicious and
cruel on occasion in those attempts to display the truth of their preachings,
 yet
many strive to help others.  The Dragon, his Prophet and his Prophetess
welcome all, be you a farmer or a soldier of war.

The Dragonsworn originally formed a large camp, more often referred to as a
reckless mob, within the Ghealdan city of Somara. Since Prophet Masema's
rallying, the 'mob' has spread out into the world, its members preaching
of the greatness and the impending victory of Rand al'Thor. Many less violent
people, generally merchants, have joined the calling, and now sell what they
claim to be pieces of the Dragon's clothing or equipment. The trend has
spread to all corners of the mainlands.

ENTERTAINERS

     Touching every land, reaching into the hearts and minds of royalty
and commoner alike, knowing no social boundaries, are those who are known 
as Entertainers.
     The \c09Gleefolk\c00, men and women, marked with the patch-covered cloak, 
traverse the length and breadth of the world, finding sanctuary in every 
village and inn or tavern therein. Trained to sing, make music, perform 
ballads and sonnets or poetry of the ages, or even simply entertain with
acrobats and juggling, their skill is such that they can resurrect the 
thoughts and emotions of past dead heroes. They bring a few hours of 
entertainment and joy to the lives of the citizenry, allowing them to 
forget about daily troubles and worries. However, this is not a trade for 
innocence or for such a trait to survive long. the world is a hard place, 
filled with unfriendly types that seek nothing but to bring strife and 
hardship to even these entertainers. To combat such evilness, the men and 
women who take up the Patchwork cloak are taught in the art of the dagger 
and various other unknown and dark trades to defend themselves against 
these harbingers of ill fortune. It is not known, yet suspected, that some 
of the more talented and well-established Gleefolk, dabble their fingers in 
the game that is Daes Daemar, the shadowy war of nobility that is played at 
various levels, in every land. Information is something that is useful to any 
who wish to survive, and gleefolk excel in gleaning it from almost anyone.
     The \c11Illuminators\c00 cannot be described in any other way than
 secretive,
suspicious and extremely dangerous. Their craft is deeply steeped in the 
protective cloak of mystery and misinformation,  this closely-knit and
close-mouthed group say little and reveal less whenever one tries to engage 
them in conversation. Having two chapter houses, the original in Tanchico 
and a newly established  house of secrets in Cairhien, they are a small 
group but when called upon to perform their trade, that of illuminating 
the skies with  dazzling Fireworks, there are none other who approach 
their skill or knowledge of the creation of such Fireworks. Of late, there 
seems to have been some troubles within their secretive ranks, for the 
Chapter house in Cairhien has recently burned to the ground, the leader of 
the establishment, found to be missing and presumed dead. Little is known 
that indicates the condition of the Chapterhouse in war-torn Tarabon, yet 
it is the only standing house that this mysterious group still holds. Quite
recently, a new Chapterhouse was erected outside the eastern gates of 
Caemlyn. It appears to be empty, but, who can tell what goes on past the 
thick walls that surround it.
     The \c12Menagerie\c00 are folk that travel often, from city to village,
 they 
are usually welcomed anywhere. A long train of wagons, some  filled with 
people, most filled with animals, they set up on plains and impress the
citizenry with their skills with the animals, acrobatics, balance on the
highwire, or their impressive aim. The Menagerie stays at most a month in 
any one place, moving on almost as quickly as they set up, with the wealth 
they have gleaned from those that have come to the show.

ENTREQS

   Greetings! The ENTERTAINERS guild is open for business and guess what, 
we want you! Yes you, to join us in the fun! There are a few requirements 
that I will list here:

     o You must be level 10 to be guilded
     o You must have a good background mailed to the Guildleader
     o You must have a good description, detailed (describing 
       how you look and what you are wearing)
     o You must gain one sponsor from the Entertainers guild
       and RP with the Guildleader
     o You must have fun!! :>

   Some people are not sure exactly what the ENTERTAINERS guild is, so I'll 
tell you a bit about us. We are composed of three factions mainly, the 
Gleemen, the Illuminators, and the Menagerie. When coming up with a 
background, keep in mind what each portion of the guild is like. The gleemen 
are singers, musicians, poets, storytellers, royal bards, yet most all are 
interested in listening for information. The Illuminators are a closed bunch, 
if you are accepted into their Chapterhouse, then your life becomes closed,
and you will have many secrets that are not to be told to outsiders. Because, 
if you do, you will be killed. Now, the Menagerie.. the GREAT Menagerie is a 
band of people who are acrobats, animal trainers, tightrope walkers, knife 
throwers and jugglers, as well as many other talented people who travel
nomadically from town to town giving shows.

EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points
  * When you are grouped, you get exp calculated on the average level
    of the members in the group, divided on the total amount of members.
    Example: Three people are grouped, one level 20, one level 100 and
    a level 30. They get the exp a level (20+100+30)/3 = 50 would have
    gained, divided by three.

FAQ "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS" NEWBIE

   Some survival tips for you while you are new to the lands of the
Dragon's Fang; not all of them are apparent, but most of them should be
mandatory to ensure your having a good time around.

QUESTION: Where is everything?
ANSWER: Around. In this helpfile, instructions about reaching various
        places will be given starting from the recall room. You may
        always get to that room by typing "home" and pressing Enter -
        the "home" command will be working for you until you reach the
        40th level of experience.

 ---->  Type "help basic" for more about specific places.

QUESTION: Where do I find food/water?
ANSWER: Both can be found just up, north of recall near the Oval plaza.
        Just type "list" to see what is available, and "buy <item>" to
        buy something that caught your eye. For example, "buy bread" .

        To get water, just type "drink fountain" and if you have a water
        container (which you can buy from that same room if you type
        "buy skin" you can also type "fill skin fountain" and later on
        in the game "drink skin" to drink wherever you are until you
        empty it. There is a fountain in the Oval plaza.

QUESTION: How do I get in a guild?
ANSWER: You must be at least level 20 before you can join a Guild in the
        Dragon's Fang. Other than that, Role Playing your character as
        seeking your Guild of choice will draw attention to you, and you
        will be able to be guilded.
        Type "help guild" at this point for more information.

QUESTION: What are all those acronyms people use? (AFK, OOC, etc)
ANSWER: Type "help acronyms" to find what most of those mean. Ask for
        help from an immortal if you need help on something not included
        there.

QUESTION: How do I mail someone?
ANSWER: Walk to the postmaster and type "mail <person>" . End the message
        with @@ in an empty line and press enter. The postmaster is
        conveniently just Up from recall.


QUESTION: Where do I talk to lots of people at once?
ANSWER: There is a public channel called OOC which is available for
        everyone to use after reaching the 2nd level or experience. Just
        type "OOC <message>" to use it, like "OOC Hey all!" .
        Remember that since this is a public channel, you are assumed to
        use it wisely. That means, avoid spamming, and please DO not use
        four letter words to express your feelings.

QUESTION: Where do people Role Play around here?
ANSWER: Lots of places. For starters, check out the Oval Plaza (just up,
        north, west of recall), or the Golden Bowl inn (three east,
        down from the Oval plaza) .
        Or use tells/the OOC channel/the IC channel to find out where to
        find people.

QUESTION: I am low level. Where do I go to advance in levels?
ANSWER: In the first few levels, before you are powerful enough or have
        friends to help you and eq to enhance you, you are suggested to
        walk around the city you are in and use the consider command on
        mobs (monsters, guards, etc) you encounter. if you are in
        Caemlyn like most people, kill suspicious whitecloaks,
        flies, a bit later on annoying peddlers to level.
        In most cases, leveling is a matter of trial-and-error. You may
        die a few times before you understand how things work. *smile*

QUESTION: Is Player Killing allowed on the Dragon's Fang?
ANSWER: Type "help pk" .

FOOD DRINK

  Just like in Real Life(tm) you have to drink and eat, in order to keep
your stamina. On Dragons Fang, you can't die neither from thirst, nor
hunger. But, the more hungry and/or thirsty you become, the longer it'll
take you to regain mana, hitpoints and moves. And being stuck in the
Blight without food or water, and no strength to defend yourself, is
NOT a good position in life. :)

FORSAKEN

The Forsaken is the name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes
Sedai of the age of legends, thus among the most powerful ever known;
who went over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow in return
for the promise of immortality. The Forsaken were cast into the Dark
One's prison when Lews Therin and the Hundred companions resealed the
bore, the counterstroke of this by the Dark One resulted in the male
half of the True Source becoming tainted. Among themselves, and other
darkfriends, the forsaken are known as "the Chosen" those mortals who
have been chosen by the Dark One to become one of his Immortal servants.

The names of the forsaken are:
Aginor, Asmodean, Balthamel, Be'lal, Demandred, Graendal, Ishamael,
Lanfear, Mesaana, Moghedien, Rahvin, Sammael and Semirhage.

It is believed by those with current knowledge of the events in the
world that only Demandred and Sammael remain living among the men; and
only Graendal, Mesaana, Moghedien, and Semirhage among the women
(However, it is most likely that two of the Forsaken were brought back
from the grave as Aran'gar and Osan'gar, both who wield Saidin).

A number of strange encounters, and activities suggest the possibility
either that several new Chosen have been selected by the Dark One; or
that the Lord of the Grave has in some cases reached beyond death.      

It will be noted, that due their highly developed abilities at stealth
and cunning, it is widely believed that the forsaken are still trapped in
the bore by many. Each one has spent over four hundred years honing their
channeling and manipulative abilities to a razor sharp edge. Many would  
be heros or fools seek to meet with and test themselves against any one  
of the forsaken. This has often led to the premature demise of the said  
hero or fool. At other times, when a forsaken so chooses, this person has 
been said to face a fate worse then death.

\c11Becoming one of the Forsaken:\c00

ALL Forsaken are book characters and need to be interview by the DF/FS GLs.

To apply for one of the forsaken book characters, you must Mudmail Shai'tan,
or Shaidar with a formal application for the character you are interested in.
Please include the following information in the application:


1) The name of the Forsaken book character you are interested in.
2) Which of the Wheel of Time books you have read.
3) Why you are interested in this character.
4) What other characters you have played on Dragon's Fang, including other
   book characters.
5) Any guilds you have belonged to on Dragon's Fang.
6) How often you will be able to play the character.
7) What you know, book wise about the Forsaken you are applying for.
8) Any other information you wish me to know.

Sometime after Shai'tan or Shaidar receives your application, you will be
contacted either by Mud mail, or personally if Shai'tan or Shaidar are on
at the time. You will be informed if your application has been accepted,
or refused, and why. If you are accepted, you will be interviewed by
Shai'tan, who will ask you between 15 to 35 questions to determine your
book knowledge. If you pass this test, you will be given the character
you have applied for.

(Note from Shai'tan)
  To all those who wish to play one of the dreaded forsaken, there are two
pieces of information you should know. One, you can apply for one of the
forsaken book characters that is already taken, and if I think you will
perform better than the existing person, you will replace him/her. Second,
if you join the forsaken guild you CAN NOT have any other darkfriend 
characters on Dragon's Fang. This rule exists so that the forsaken will 
be an active part of the mud; and there will be no exception to this 
rule, ever.

FSPOLICY
The Chosen, as roleplayers, should be of the highest quality and well versed 
in current mud Policy and guidelines. Due to their unequalled power relative 
to mortal players and In Character nature they are also highly influencial 
to all roleplay on Dragons Fang. It for this reason that players of Chosen, 
like all Darkfriends, are so only because of the approval of the Darkfriend 
Guildleaders and if such a situation or circumstance shall arise where a 
Darkfriend Guildleader decides that they should be removed then it is so 
without question or appeal. All Chosen players must seek to improve and 
expand the roleplay of the Darkfriends and the mud as a whole and, in all 
instances, roleplay true to their characters history, book definied 
abilities and status, and within the guildelines set down for them.

Equipment:
In the Chosen guild room an unlimited supply of Chosen guild equipment will, 
and is, stored. Each Chosen may take, and use, as much as they feel 
necessary. It is advised that each Chosen have at least two full sets of 
tooled equipment for their disguises. The Chosen guild equipment shall 
never, under any circumstances, be given, borrowed or used by anyone not of 
the Chosen Guild. It is also required when tooling the Chosen equipment that 
forsaken remain a keyword for administrative purposes.

Promotion/Demotion:
Chosen are often the primary instigators for the promotion and demotion of 
Darkfriends. Each Chosen may recommend, at any time, to the Darkfriend 
Guildleaders for the promotion or demotion of Darkfriends based on In 
Character circumstances. Chosen may also recommend promotion and/or award of 
Questpoints based on the witness of excellent roleplay and effort.

Skills:
Each Chosen is given, in code, all weaves and skills that the Darkfriend 
Guildleaders can be satisfied is In Character or reflective of their In 
Character status and relative abilities. It is advised not to discuss with 
anyone besides other members of the Chosen Guild that skills and attributes 
a character has.

Teaching:
A Chosen may roleplay teach any skill or weave In Characterly appropriate to 
both student and teacher if the skill or weave in question is gainable by 
mortal players at the Trainer or is considered  roleplay gainable or 
instructable on the MUD. The Chosen may also teach, when appropriate the 
Darkfriend Guild skills the student is In Characterly and Out of Characterly 
entitled. However, without the express permission of a Darkfriend 
Guildleader no Chosen may teach any Chosen guild skills or weaves and skill 
such as balefire, compulsion, inversion, forcible turning or any other 
unbalancing ability.

Killing:
As per the general MUD guildelines a Chosen must in all instances roleplay 
their characters reflective of their abilities and nature and be true to 
their In Character history. As such if In Characterly a Chosen finds it 
necessary to attempt to maim, hurt or kill another player based on the 
roleplay that unfolds then a Chosen should and must roleplay the response 
the situation requires. In all cases roleplay is preferred to code when 
dealing with another Darkfriend. A Chosen should be of sufficient skill as a 
roleplayer that code is generally not used at all.

Shadowspawn:
No Chosen shall roleplay the creation of mortal shadowspawn players without 
the approval of the Darkfriend Guildleaders. Chosen shall also seek approval 
before emote or echoing the use of rare or restricted forms of Shadowspawn 
such as Gholam.

Naeblis:
The position of Naeblis is given or taken away with due consideration of In 
Character circumstance and activity. All loyal soldiers of the Shadow 
should, as in all instances, give as much authority to the Naeblis as he or 
she can enforce. Naeblis is the strongest and most cunning and ruthless of 
the Great Lords servants.

Disguises:
Disguise, being a Chosen guildskill, is a powerful ability that is 
restricted to its ranks. The following guidelines apply;
Darking - a Chosen may ask a Darkfriend Guildleader or any approved Immortal 
to code dark (guild) their disguise to ensure the integrity of their hidden 
identity.
Guilds - before disguising into a guild besides the Darkfriend and Chosen 
guilds a Chosen player must seek the permission of the Guildleader in 
charge. For long term or significant roleplay the general approval of the 
guildleader should be sought but notification of all intentions is not 
required.
Names - disguised names should be, of course, appropriate to the Wheel of 
Time theme of the MUD and shall not be of a player past or present without 
due In Character circumstance and notification.

Revealing Darkfriends:
Inline with MUD policy and in suppliment, under no circumstances without the 
specific approval of a Darkfriend Guildleader or the player in question, 
shall any person reveal Out of Characterly reveal the name and associations 
of a guilded Darkfriend. For a Chosen, to do so is to resign as well as 
suffer the consequences of this action.

Out of Character Interactions:
The Chosen are Book Characters and in suppliment to MUD policy they may not 
interact with players in any Out of Character fashion that is not conductive 
to current or future roleplay. This includes assisting mortals to level or 
equip and protect themselves.

Death:
Chosen, like any players on the MUD, have a duty to roleplay themselves with 
the integrity and abiltities of their character in mind. If as a consequence 
of In Character actions a Chosen is killed, then unless otherwise stated  
and arranged by the Darkfriend Guildleader the following proceedure applies-
The Chosen shall return to the room in which the incident occurred and sleep 
there for a 30 minute timeout period. After such a time they will be 
unaffected of any and all injuries and then be considered rewoven into the 
Pattern by the Lord of the Grave. While the 30 minute interval takes place 
the Chosen in question may not take any In Character action.

...Continued from FSPOLICY

Mindtraps:
Mindtraps, as In Characterly shown, may only be introduced and enforced on a 
player with the approval of the Darkfriend Guildleaders. It is a rare and 
significant event and, as such, the wishes of the player concerned shall be 
considered.

Angreal, Saangreal and Terangreal (*angreal)
A Chosen shall not give any type of *angreal to a player In Characterly, or 
in code, without the permission of one of the Darkfriend Guildleaders in 
suppliment to MUD policy. In the case of adam and other binding collars, 
with Chosen/Darkfriend links the normal Roleplay guidelines apply but in 
Chosen/Chosen roleplay the guidance of the Darkfriend Guildleaders should be 
sought but is not required.

Forced Turnings:
Under no circumstances may a player who is Out of Characterly unwilling be 
forced to In Characterly join the Darkfriend Guild. Before any such roleplay 
proceeds approval must be gained from both the player as well as one of the 
Darkfriend Guildleaders. The player must also be informed of the In 
Character consequences of being forcibly turned against their will which 
result from the means.

Darking (guilding):
A Chosen may ask either Darkfriend Guildleader to guild a mortal player into 
the Darkfriend Guild when he or she is In Characterly satisfied they shall 
serve as such. Most guilding is solely based on the recommendation of the 
Chosen and care should be taken to ensure that the player is both In and Out 
of Characterly ready to join. This means making sure their level of 
roleplay, character history, description etc are acceptable. If a Chosen 
does not want to specifically sponser a seeker however but still wishes to 
roleplay or recommend aspects of a player to the Darkfriend Guildleaders 
then they are encouraged to do so.

Bonds:
The Chosen-Minion bond is, unless otherwise stated, an Out of Character 
relationship between a Chosen and his or her minion. It is a symbolic and 
representative of the In Character roleplay they have engaged in. Chosen may 
only bond Darkfriends of rank higher or equal to the Basic Member Rank. Due 
to the nature only the highest and most trusted and loyal servants are to be 
bonded.
Chosen may of course, after having grounding themselves with the knowledge, 
bond a minion or other using an Aes Sedai or Ashaman type bond. This 
however has the same ramifications as any who weave it and shall endure the 
conseuqneces of such. Under no circumstances shall a Chosen Out of 
Characterly bond anyone nor shall they bond a non-guilded Darkfriend. In 
place of an actual woven bond it is best advised to use the same basic 
method but modified as circumstances permit, that Moiraine Aes Sedai used in 
the Eye of the World when she warded coins and gave them to her charges.

In Addition:
The above guidelines and policy are enforcible by the Darkfriend 
Guildleaders and the failure of any Chosen to comply may result in their 
immediate removal, and, in the case of code abuse, the deletion of any other 
players involved. The Darkfriend Guildleaders, being merciful and just gods, 
can and will consider surrounding circumstance and reason before making a 
decision and may give specific permission where appropriate and required for 
the guidelines to be altered or alternativly interpreted. In all 
circumstances common sense should be used and the wishes of all parties 
concerned weighed with due consideration.

GOOOC GOIC
\c02   The OOC and IC states of a character on Dragon's Fang is easily
determined with simple code; this will affect everything you do in
different ways - here is how it works.\c00
   Any given character can either be \c01IC\c00 or \c01OOC\c00 at any given
time. Type:

\c01GOIC\c00 to switch to In Character mode. Now, you will be In Character
where you are on the MUD (you cannot claim to be Out of Character if someone
wishes to Roleplay with you in the room you are in). All your channeling is
considered to be IC - and if you overchannel, you burn out. Your taint, if
you are a male channeler, may increase with various results.
   You can always switch to In Character mode simply by typing this command;
nothing can prevent you from Roleplaying whenever you feel like it.
\c01GOOOC\c00 to switch to Out of Character mode. Now, you will be considered
to be Out of Character wherever you are. You may still burn out, and, of
course, channeling is still IC. On the other hand, you cannot see what
In Character people are saying or doing while in this mode.
   In order to be able to switch to Out of Character mode, you mustn't have
Roleplayer anything for a small while - that is, not have used the "emote"
and "say" commands for a small time period.

GUILD GUILDS

  The Guild area is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles
and perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only
members may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people
come to learn and practice the skills of their trade.

The guilds that you can join are the following:

\c06	\c07Aiel:\c00
          The descendants of the people who worked as servants before
          the Breaking, they are considered to be the fiercest warriors
          living, as a group regarded. The live in the Three-Fold Land
          and refer to all other peoples as 'Wetlanders'

\c06	\c07Asha'man:\c07
          Male channelers who have joined a society to aid the Dragon
          Reborn at Tarmon Gaidon, the Last Battle. They are considered
          to be the elite forces following the Dragon Reborn as they can
          wield Saidin, but the price is high; they will all eventually
          go mad because of the Taint on Saidin placed there by the Dark One.

\c06	\c07Band of the Red Hand:\c00
          A rather haphazard group of people all following
          Mat Cauthon, a Ta'veren with incredible luck and one of the child-
          hood friends of Rand al'Thor. This 'army' has so far never lost.

\c06	\c07Children of the Light:\c07
          A group of zealous, some say fanatic, soldiers
          in a rigid army regarding themselves to be the only true followers
          of the Light. They have been accused of many transgressions, but
          never so that others can hear; they are numerous and very skilled
          fighters.

\c06      \c07Daes Dae'mar:\c00
          A guild that spans across the entire Nation and consists of
          Nobles, guards, Magistrates, Thieftakers, servants, and more,
          all willing or forced players of the Gr. These people
          will lie, poison, act diplomatic, or even assassinate to get
          what they want: bettering themselves and their rank or House.

\c06	\c07Darkfriend:\c00
          People who for different reasons have turned to the Shadow
          and now follow the Lord of the Dark. This is the only guild that
          people can join together with another guild.

\c06    \c07Entertainers:\c00
          Rogues of the lands, bearers of tales and myths. They make a man
          a legend or leave him as nothing more than a speck of dirt on the
          ground. Entertainers come in many forms: Gleeman with rich stories
          or saucy bartunes, Illuminators and their mystical fireworks,
          actors of the stage, trainers and performers of traveling
          menageries. These men and women travel often and try to evade
          being tied down by anything.
        
\c06	\c07Forsaken:\c00
          They call themselves the Chosen are -very- few, a dozen or
          so. They are those who have been selected by the Dark One to
          be immortals as reward for a long service, spanning over millenia
          in most instances. They are invariably superb channelers and
          fighters, better than almost all mortals, and most people regard
          them as myths or sagas. ALL Chosen are book characters and need
          to apply by interview.

\c06      \c07Hunters of the Horn:
          Those who have taken the Oath at the Square of Tammuz in Illian
          and now dedicate their time in search of the legendary Horn
          of Valere. Many of these Hunters become legends themselves;
          Gleeman sing praises even to those long gone. It is said that
          whoever finds the Horn of Valere will become a true legend.
	  (Note: this is a part of the Daes Dae'mar guild)

\c06      \c07Kin:\c00
	  The channeling Healers of the mud, these women form a circle
          of mostly runaways from the White Tower: girls who did not make
	  it as Aes Sedai or were too scared to stay. Instead they use their
	  channeling ability in Ebou Dar to help heal the injured and
   	  act as mediators, like any strong woman would. The Kin know quite
	  a bit about herbs and medicine, and though they are not considered
	  as strong as Aes Sedai, they have their tricks, and also take most
	  any girl who shows she can channel, as their training is less rigorous.

\c06	\c07Ogier:\c00
          A race of very large, very kind and very slow people, who are
          spoken of as the Builders, due to their superb skills in building
          cities and pieces of art. They live in Steddings and live a very
          long life, more than three centuries generally. Lately the have
          become shy and secluded and keep to their Steddings.

\c06	\c07Rebel Aes Sedai:\c00
          Aes Sedai who have broken with the Tower and now are
          placed in Salidar. They are ruled by Egwene al'Vere, a childhood
          friend of Rand al'Thor.

\c06	\c07Rebel Warders:\c00
          Warders who follow their Sedai who have broken with the Tower.

\c06	\c07Seanchan:\c00
          People coming back across the Aryth Ocean to reclaim what
          they think of as theirs: the rest of the world. They are the
          descendants of Artur Hawkwing, one of the greatest rulers that
          ever has lived.

\c06    \c07Tuatha'an:\c00
          People who follow The Way of the Leaf, a way of nonviolence and
          happiness, commonly called Tinkers. Most people, especially in
          large cities, view the Tinkers with fear, as they are reputated
          (without much evidence) to steal and subvert youths. Tinkers
          spend their lives traveling from place to place in colored wagons


\c06	\c07Tower Aes Sedai:\c00
          Aes Sedai who chose to stay with the Tower when it split,
          and who still are governed by Elaida, the Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon.
          The Tower Aes Sedai have little but contempt for those who became
          rebels, but are still trying to make them come back.

\c06	\c07Tower Warders:\c00
          The Warders to the Sedai that chose to stay in the Tower
          when it split. They are also called the Younglings.

You need to be \c03level 20\c00 before you can join any Guild on the Dragon's
Fang, except for the Tuatha'an, who are not allowed to level.

   After you reach the 20th level of experience (thus proving you know at
least some basic things about the Mud, and that you have a certain degree
of dedication - enough to level that far) you may Role Play and seek the
Guild of your choice.

Remember to seek your Guild in an \c02IC\c00 way - that is, seek the one most
appropriate to the way you want to play your character, not according to
the bonuses you will get in skills or the power of its equipment.
   For most Guilds around, there are specific help files. You can try
typing "\c03help <Guild name>\c00" for details, or ask on the OOC channel about
it. Alternatively, you may contact that Guild's own Guild Leaders (the
Immortals responsible for it) to ask anything you may need.

         \c01See also info on each guild for more information.\c00

GUILDWALK

   To assist Role Playing, you can type \c01guildwalk\c00 to travel back to
 your
assigned guildarea. You can only do this whenever you could normally recall,
and it's strictly against policy to use the command to escape RP.
   The rigorous trip also leaves you particularly exhausted.

HARASSMENT SEXUAL MUDSEX

  Unfortunately, these issues can become problems in a mud setting.       
We at Dragon's Fang wish to deal with any problems of this nature in         
a manner that both protects the integrity of the mud and respects our         
players' privacy.  It is our desire to provide a comfortable environment      
for a wide variety of people.  Our Immortals will use discretion above    
all when dealing with possible improprieties.  No snooping or watching
without consent will be done except in regards to possible cheating or
breaking of rules.   The Council will hold ultimate and final authority
in punishing any infractions.

  Infractions will most likely come to the Council's attention through a
variety of means including acts done in public, complaints made by other
players or indiscretely made and shared logs.

  In determining what would be considered inappropriate, we must,   
as George Michael asks in 'I Want Your Sex' "What's your definition   
of dirty, what do you consider pornography?", define pornography on  
Dragon's Fang.  A basic line must be drawn.  That line is at child      
pornography, bestiality, forced sexual roleplay or sexual harassment.   

  Sexual harassment is defined as repetitive, chronic, recurring          
undesired sexual advances, innuendoes, or actions via any number             
of channels, tells, says or emotes and include both ic and ooc
actions.

Punishments will be determined on a case by case basis, the exception
being sexual harassment, which results in deletion/possible site ban.

HEALING
  On a mud you fight mobs, gain experience and inevitably get hurt.
There are several ways to heal. The simplest is to simply wait; you get
Hitpoints, Movement points and Mana points back each mud hour (about one
minute). If you rest or sleep, you heal faster. If you are hungry or
thirsty, you heal more slowly.
  There are also healing weaves which the channelers can weave upon you,
should you be fortunate enough to be friends with one.
  Additionally, Immortals sometimes heal or refresh the mud, so be nice to
them. ;)

  If you \c01burn out\c00 - or are stilled (i.e. lose the ability to channel)
try to find someone ICly who can heal you - IMMs are \c01_not_\c00 there to
heal you whenever you need it. If you are leveling and are near to burning
out, type 'home' and go to the Oval, where you can release without burning
out.

HINTS

Some general hints: (in random order)

1)  Do not annoy others.
2)  Don't be easily annoyed.
3)  If annoyed, ask an Imm for help, don't try to deal in the matter with
    Pkills, or harassment or similar. This will earn you nothing but
    unpleasant surprises.
4)  If harassed, feeling unfairly treated or anything like that, even if
    the source of your troubles are an Imm, see No3. No one is above the law
    ghere on Dragons Fang, no matter their position.
5)  Be helpful towards other players, it will make it easier for you to
    gain help in return, come the day YOU are in trouble.
6)  Remember the magic word, Gimme! :) Nah, the magic word is PLEASE, using
    this small and seemingly insignificant word, you might get help 9 times
    out of 10.
7)  Save often, although the game autosaves all characters every minute,
    a lot of things can happen between saves, and if the MUD crashes...
8)  If (when) AutoQuests are implemented, do NOT give away solutions to
    players trying to solve it. Subtle hints are allowed at your own
    descretion, but if we found out ANYONE giveing away clear descriptions
    on how to solve a certain quest. That person is up for a guided tour in
    the Freezer!
9)  Make sure you got food and water with you all the time. If you can
    channel, the spells "Create Water" and "Create Food" might be
    interesting.
10) Do not Pkill, unless the fight is a result from RP. We're harsh
    with ANY un-justified Pkills.
11) Use your common sense, and the golden rule in your dealings with both
    mortals and immortals on DF, and you will be Ok in 99 times of 100.

HOME

This command will take your character to it's homeroom. The homeroom
is defined by which race you've chosed at creaton. For Instance,
a Borderlander will be transfered to Fal Dara, a Seanchan to
Seandar.
*NOTE that many homerooms have not yet been set. You may end up in Caemlyn.

HUNTERS GREAT HORN VALERE

Have you ever dreamed of riding alongside the legendary Rogosh Eagle-Eye
or fighting side by side with Gaidal Cain and the Golden Haired Birgitte?
Travel the world like Jain Farstrider in your search for the legendary
Horn of Valere! The call for the Great Hunt for the Horn has been declared.
Now Heroes, Adventurers, and even Rogues have set out to claim the glory
of discovering the elusive Horn and becoming legends themselves. Seek 
out the Horn of Valere and gain Fame! Glory! Riches! There is always 
the possibility of danger and perhaps even death. Do you have the skill 
and determination to overcome the obstacles to become a true Hero?

If this is so, and you wish to take the oaths in the Square of
Tammuz in the glorious city of Illian, you must be level 20 and
mail a background history of your character to the Daes Dae'mar GL(s).
This history must lead up to the reason why your character wishes to 
become a Hunter of the Horn, be it for Greed, Glory, or even for the 
good of the land. Once this is done, you will encounter one or more 
actual Hunters. They will test your skill in roleplay. You will then be 
contacted by mail as to whether you shall be traveling to take the 
oaths at Illian.

IMMORTALITY IMM
  Sooner or later, if you continue to play here at Dragons Fang, you WILL
run into something called Immortals. They follow many of the same rules
and have many of the same good times as you do.

Contrary to most other MUDs you CAN'T gain Immortality by bashing mobs, once
you've reached lvl 199 (the highest mortal level) you won't simply gain any
xp for your kills. Even though the code says that you do. Immortality is a
gift for those who do their best, and devote some time, (ehr, haven't I said
this already? :)) NOT for being the MUDs biggest mob-basher.

Time devotion is very important to the staff. Because of this, if you are
considering applying to be a Questor, Guildleader, or Builder, you will
need to have acquired 120 hours total (all your characters combined) and
have been playing on this mud for at least 10 weeks.

Also, to clear up any issues, no immortal may use his immortal alt to
deal with ANY situation involving ANY of his mortal alts. This is to
ensure non-bias and fairness, and is a policy without exception.

JENN
  The "thirteenth clan" of the Aiel, the way of the Jenn has not been
seen since the Breaking of the World. Originally called the Da'shain,
these Aiel served the Aes Sedai while following the Covenant, also termed
the Way of the Leaf (see HELP TINKERS). When the Breaking occured, these
peaceful Aiel were forced to travel in search of a safe place for a large
cargo entrusted to them by the Aes Sedai. It is the Aiel belief that this
safe place was never found and that they had failed the Aes Sedai.

  During the long years of traveling, the Da'shain split twice: the first
came when Sulwin took many Aiel away to find what he called the Seed Song.
These people were the original Tuatha'an. Because they left the Da'shain
and their promise to the Aes Sedai, they became Lost.  The second split
brought about the Aiel we know today. This idea of violence and fighting
as a way to protect oneself changed most of the Da'shain. These new Aiel
called the peaceful ones the Jenn (Old Tongue for 'true') and protected
them until the Jenn disappeared completely.

JI'E'TOH
  The Aiel live by a code of honor and duty - Ji'e'toh, which prescribes
the correct behavior for any situation. Ji'e'toh isn't a written code, but
rather a taught way of living for the Aiel.
  For example, if someone incurs toh toward someone else, only the person
who has committed the wrongdoing can ascertain whether he or she has Toh
towards the other person or not. You cannot tell someone else that they
owe you Toh, else this incurs even more Toh, as well as offends the Ji
(honor) of the other person.
  There are many paths to gaining JI or TOH, and not all are in battle. The
paths to earning Ji in battle are many, as are the ways which Toh is gained.
For example, the greatest Ji is earned by touching an armed and living enemy
without causing harm. The smallest path to earning Ji is to kill, for anyone
can kill. Somewhere in the middle of these two extremes is taking someone
gai'shain (a servitude of a year and a day, in which the gai'shain cannot
wield weapons and must wear white, among other customs).
  Shame has many levels in Ji'e'toh, and is considered to a worse occurance
than pain, injury or even death on many of those levels.
  There are many ways of meeting Toh, but even the smallest infraction must
be met in full. Toh outweighs all other considerations, to the extent that
Aiel will accept shame to fulfill an obligation that may seem minor to an
outlander.

KIN "THE KIN"
  The Kin are essentially a secret society of women channelers who have
hidden headquarters in Ebou Dar, a port city northwest of Illian and far
to the south of Caemlyn.
  They number more than 2000 in number, far outnumbering the number of
Sedai that have existed, even before the White Tower split into two
factions. Most, if not all, are novices and accepted that have, in the
past, either refused to be tested for the shawl in the White Tower, or
have not been found adequate for the shawl for several reasons. However,
Sedai are still revered by the Kin.
  As Kin, you will be sworn to secrecy, as no one outside the Kin know
that we exist, and spreading of such knowledge is certainly frowned upon,
as it threatens our safety. Many Kin are healers, as this Talent seems
abundant in Wise Women, which some of us are.
  As a guild, Kin requirements are level 20 (as are all guilds), female,
channeler/wilder/or born with the spark, a history submitted to the Reanne,
and possible some RP with present Kin members or the GL.

KINRANKS
  As the Kin attempt to emulate the Aes Sedai as much as they can, short of
claiming that they are Aes Sedai and wearing the serpent ring, the ranks
of this guild reflect this attitude toward the White Tower:
  \c02Guarded\c00 - those that have runaway from the Tower, and are being
            held to be returned.
  \c02Wilders\c00 - those that the Kin have found to channel naturally, but
            have not been to the Tower. Most, if not all, will be turned
            over to the Tower (the Rebel Sedai, since Elayne Sedai forged
            an alliance with the Kin). Many wilders are the apprentices
            of nearby Wise Woman.
  \c02Apprentice\c00 - Once a woman is taken in by the Kin, she begins a
            training that attempts to emulate the training they had
            previously received.
            There are 5 subranks for Apprentices:
               Apprentice [Initiate]
               Apprentice [Practiced]
               Apprentice [Advanced]
               Apprentice [Prepared]
               Apprentice [Learned]
            Advancement through these 5 ranks depends on a loose
            syllabus and active RP with Wise Women and Elders.
  \c02Wise Woman\c00 - Once done with your Apprentice Training, you
            become a full Wise Woman, and can begin a Healing shop if you
            so choose. Since the Kin focus a lot on healing weaves, and
            since many of the Kin were Wise Woman trained in the Ebou Dari
            tradition, there is an abundance of healers in the Kin. Most
            Kin know beyond the basics of healing using the One Power.
            There are 7 subranks for Wise Women to choose from (see help)
  \c02Mistress of the Runaways\c00 - She takes care of those who have run away 
from
            the Tower.
  \c02Mistress of the Wilders\c00 - She takes care of the Wilders and makes
 sure
            they train at the Tower.
  \c02Mistress of Apprentices\c00 - She arranges the lessons and advancement of
            Apprentices.
  \c02Mistress of Discipline\c00 - For those Apprentices that misbehave.
  \c02Elder\c00   - After many years, and faithful service to the Kin, you may
            be called upon to join the Knitting Circle - the ruling body
            of the Kin (13 women).
  \c02Second Eldest\c00 - second in rank in the Knitting Circle. does not have
            to be an IMM.
  \c02Eldest\c00 - the GL rank :)

KINRP
  The Kin are a secret society of women channelers, so no word should be
spoken mentioning the Kin or anything related to the location of the Kin
farm. Noting the dangers of anyone knowing that a Kinswoman can channel,
Kin should also be very very reluctant to spread knowledge that she can
channel. Also, a Kinswoman should avoid channeling in public to an extreme,
even if she thinks she is alone. All healing weaves should be done near
a Wise Woman or healer's shop, and should be disguised by using herbs and
other supplies as well.
  If a Kin reveals the location of the farm or the existance of the Kin to
an outsider, she will be punished severely, possibly stilled and put under
guard. Pains will be taken to remove traces of the farm or the existance
of the Kin.
  The Kin revere Aes Sedai, and according respect should be shown to them
if their presence is known. Likewise, a Kin should never channel within
a league of an Aes Sedai (another reason to keep public channeling secret)
and should conceal their channeling ability near Aes Sedai (this is one
of the basic weaves taught to apprentices).
  After apprenticeship, Kinswoman are free to leave the farm or their place
of apprenticeship and do as they choose, always remembering their ties and
allegiance to the Knitting Circle and remembering the location of the Kin
farm near the Rahad and Kin messengers throughout the land (all Kin should
know the marker for a Kin informant on healer's shops).

KINSUBRANKS
  The Kin model themselves after the Aes Sedai, and the subranks of their
Wise Women as well as their Elders reflect that:

  [\c10Scholar\c00]    - those who study and wish to learn; bookworms.
  [\c07Philosopher\c00]- those who take themselves up with the questions of
 life.
  [\c01Seeker\c00]     - those who spend their time finding runaways and other

LOCATE
   When you use this skill, you have a chance of discovering hidden players
in your room. You can't search very often, but if you find someone spying on
you he/she will be unable to hide for a limited time period as you confront
them.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

\c01If however, you were looking for a help file on LINKING (i.e. with
 channelers)
then go to: \c07HELP LINKING\c00

LINKING
  All channelers can link (join their power) with other channelers. Linking
has the advantage of increasing your grasp of the One Power - the more people
link the more mana they have, and the stronger weaves they can weave.
You can link with a channeler who is female or male - up to thirteen female
channelers can link and up to two male ones can link, without the aid of
a female channeler. More than two male channelers need a female to link
with them, as do more than thirteen female channelers. Above these numbers,
male and females need to alternate in order to extend the link.
  Here at Dragon's Fang, linking is coded to be very Wotish and IC. You need
to grasp (if you cannot grasp, make sure you are both a channeler and not
in a room which does not allow channeling), have the other person grasp, and
type "link <person>." Remember to Dissolve the link when you are done! Else,
the other person will end up being linked and following you forever :)

MAIL MUDMAIL
There is a mailing system withing the Dragons Fang, and if you find the
place where the postmaster is you can mail the other players. The stamp
price is currently 1 coin, so there should be no monetary problems.

All you do when you are in that room is simply this:

>mail (person)
[Write the mail contents and finishing by typing @ at a new line]

And there you are! You have now mailed that person.

MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana, but
still cast the spell, you run the risk of losing your ability to cast spells
(called Stilling for women and Gentling for men) or even dying.

NAMES
"\c09What's in a name?\c00"
Shakespeare wrote it, but it has meaning to us, especially when dealing
with a mud environment. The impression you give others and the interaction
you have with them is all typewritten. There is no verbal involvement,
nor pictures to flush it out. Because of this, the name you choose to
give to a character becomes extremely important. As a Wheel of Time mud,
Dragon's Fang seeks to provide an atmosphere that is consistent with
the world created by Robert Jordan, including places and names. For this
reason, names given to characters are regulated. As a general rule,
perhaps it is best to look at choosing a name as you would choose a name
for your child. English is the basis of the mud, so most names are likely
to be English in origin, but foreign names are also appropriate. The
character you create should be unique and not a transplant from another
series or story.

Now, on to more specific guidelines:
\c011\c00) No name should be easily associated with popular books, series,
comics, or shows. Although common names used in such situations would
be allowed, ie Luke or Han, more unusual names would not, ie Obi Wan,
Drizzt, Gandalf. If a common name is used, it would be expected that a
surname that makes the character related to a series be avoided, ie if
you had Luke, you would not have his last name be Skywalker.

\c012\c00) No book names from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series will
be used unless approved for us as a book character by an immortal.

\c013\c00) Compound names, nonsense names, curse words, vulgarities, and the
like are unacceptable, ie SmegHead, LadyLuck, Mezldkwe, Vomit, ImtheMan, etc.

\c014\c00) Names based on the Old Tongue are allowed, except under the above
situations.

\c015\c00) Hyphenated or names with an apostrophe are allowed, again with the
above stipulations.

\c016\c00) Names such as Reaver, Berserker, Slicer, Rover, Biter, Bonker, etc,
are not acceptable.

\c017\c00) Variations on other book characters may be acceptable, ie Lance
 would
be OK, but not Lancelot.

\c018\c00) Different spellings of names are allowed, ie Linda and Lynda, but
 Bob
and Bobb would not, as that creates a confusion in terms of communication and
visible issues.

Ultimately, the decision in regards to a name is left to the discretion of the
Imms, following the above guidelines. Unfortunately though, Imms are people
and thus fallible and may not be familiar with all series or connotations
associated with a name. Therefore, a name may be required to be changed if
another Imm sees a relationship. We appreciate your understanding, cooperation,
and support. We hope you have a fun and relaxing experience on our mud. As
always, the immortals of the staff here at Dragon's Fang are glad to help 
you with any questions regarding the mud. Send us a tell or mail!

NOBILITY NOBLES

  When someone mentions Nobility he usually is referring to a Lord,
Lady, Heir, High Seat Prince, possibly a Queen or King. On Dragon's 
Fang you may play your character with a noble rank if you happen to be 
from such a family and have GL approval.  Usually, nobles have their 
hands deep in politics and subterfuge and so play the game of Daes 
Dae'mar. Some nobles, usually the sons and daughters of an established 
Lord, end up leaving their manor to find adventure on such grand quests 
as the Hunt for the Horn or by joining a group that follows the 
excitement of Ta'veren (see HELP BAND). There are also a few nobles 
known from other lands (see HELP SEANCHAN).
  There are many Houses already in existance, as well as those waiting 
to be occupied. Should you want to roleplay with noble birth, you must 
either speak with a noble of a House and apply (with a detailed 
background) to the Daes Dae'mar Guildleader.
  To be a noble you must know how to dress according to the nation you 
are from and know all of its culture, sayings and customs.  Nobles do 
not just sit around and give others orders, they have past times that 
they pursue and you would do well to decide upon a few.  Some examples 
would be: falconry, bird and fox hunting, training hunting dogs, riding 
horses, traveling, engaging in a merchant activity (such as overseeing 
or negotiating the trade for wine, farm produce, lumber, furs, 
cattle/sheep/meat, honey, etc.), singing, dancing or playing a musical 
instrument privately or to a small group of other nobles, drawing, 
sketching and painting, needlework (such as embroidery, weaving, lace 
work, tatting and are usually for personal gifts or as art to be 
displayed on a wall, otherwise it is labor the servants can perform), 
collect objects (such as paintings, sea folk porcelain, jewelry, 
swords, fans, saddles, knives, wine, rugs, noble titles, spouses.just 
about anything of value), receiving lessons (gleemen are good source 
for teaching singing and dancing and playing musical instruments, while 
tinkers may be helpful in teaching needlework),  buying and 
commissioning objects to given as gifts, having clothing tailor made 
(also swords, drinking cups, saddles, carriages, trunks, furniture, 
etc.are all things a noble might have made especially for 
himself/herself), fund raising (to help the poor by giving it to the 
wisdoms, or for a House project such as to build a manor, or barn, or 
repair a part of an existing structure, etc), practice your fighting 
forms with your guardsI am sure at this point you get the idea.
    Nobles have sigils, wax seals, banners (cons) and such that bear 
their country, personal and house symbols.  The symbols of the house 
and country have probably already been determined, but as a noble you 
will need to know what they are and the correct way in which to use 
them.  In addition, you will need to develop your own.  If you have 
difficulty with this be sure to ask your Daes Dae'mar Guild Leader, 
they can be a big help and have a number of resources to assist you.
    Don't do everything yourself, involve your house members.  Send 
them to find people for you, deliver messages, spy, gather information.  
Servants can cook, do laundry, see to your bath, polish your shoes and 
help you dress while pouring a glass of wine.  
    Remember to reward your guards and servants with pay, gifts and 
advancement in rank.  With guards, some sort of party or ceremony for 
promotion is usually the norm, with presentation of some metal or other 
such emblem of office.  And a ceremony is definitely the routine for 
other nobles advancing.  Remember, when you award titles to nobility 
that land and manors are usually part of that title and should be 
awarded in conjuction with the title.  Some nobles like to name manors 
and their accompanying land.
   Know the laws of your country.  Some nobles choose to dabble in the 
courts and become magistrates and chancellors with additional training.  
Each country has its own system.  Contact the Daes Dae'mar Guild Leader 
if you are interested in the council system.
   You should actively recruit for your house in order to have a strong 
and powerful house.  If you are a high seat of your house, then you 
will want to look at getting a Wisdom or house healer, an Aes Sedai 
advisor, and a court bard for entertainment.  In addition, you will 
want to build up your network of spies and informants and create 
liaisons with other houses, both with your country and in other 
countries.  Do be sensitive to the political stance of your country.  
For example, if your country is hostile to Cairhien, it isn't a good 
idea to be forming close relationships with Cairhien houses.  That 
would come under suspicion by the other houses in your country.  
   Expect to spend time making reports to your superiors and to mail 
invitations to the parties you organize ( like nameday parties, masked 
balls, tea parties, picnics.etc.)  Enlist the help of your servants to 
help plan while arranging security with your guards.

OGIER
   The Ogier are a non human race characterized by great height(average
being 10 feet tall)broad almost snoutlike noses, and long, tufted ears.
They live in areas called stedding. Their separation from these steddings
after the breaking of the world created the longing; an Ogier that stays
to long outside a stedding feels this longing and if to long out they can
die of it. Widely reknowned for their stone work and building of the great
human cities they consider their stone work simple compared to their
wonderful works of Treesinging; the process by which an article is moulded
by singing to a tree and bending the tree to the shape that you want
Treesung wood objects are very hard and durable (practicably unbreakable)
   Ogiers are also very great keepers of knowledge and as the average Ogier
lives till about 600 years they collect a lot of books and knowledge and
consider humans hasty.

"ONE POWER"

  The One Power (OP in short) is the "magic" in the world of the Wheel
of Time, and also the magic system in Dragons Fang.
  One Power, also called the True Source (not to be confused with the True
Power, which is used only by the highest Darkfriends and some Forsaken), is
made of Saidar (the female part) and Saidin (the male part, which has been
tainted by the Dark One). The One Power is wielded by 'grasping' (for women
it is 'embracing' as well, since Saidar is wielded by surrendering to it and
Saidin is wielded by wrestling with it.) (grasping is the equivalent of
holding magic).
  The One Power is made of five parts - or flows as they are called
(Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit and Water). These five flows are 'woven' (the
equivalent of casting in the WoT world) into different patterns and 'weaves'
(the WoT equivalent of spells) By blending these five flows differently,
you get different results; Spirit  has much to do with living things, Air
manipulates the air and light, Earth deals with things that move the earth,
and so on.
  The more you have in each flow, the more spells (here called weaves) you
can gain and use. A list of what preconditions there are for the spells can
be seen by typing "spells".
Also, spell damage rates are related to how strong you are compared to
the prerequisites: If you have twice the requirements to gain the spell,
your damage/effect is doubled! In some spells, this isn't applicable,
and the flow/prerec ratio isn't affecting anything.
  You raise your ability in each weave by spending Trains, which
you get each time you gain a level. The cost is 1 Train to raise one flow 
one step.
  Each weave needs to be bought, varying between costing 1train up to 8
trains or so (you gain trains when you level, as you do practices.. 10pracs
= 1 train). Then each weave can be practised at the trainer up to a max
of
70%, beyond which it can gain only from use. There are also special weaves,
in addition to special skills, which you gain if you are in a guild.

ORIGIN ORIGINS

There are many places from which a person in the Wheel of Time may come,
and in Dragon's Fang the following origins are available to you:

Three-fold land, Almoth, Amadicia, Andor,Arad Doman, Borderlands, Cairhien,
Illian, Murandy, Seanchan, Tarabon, Tar Valon, Tear, Tremalking and Two Rivers.

The origins give some modifiers to the original stats (Strength,
Constitution etc) but no bonuses. The predefined origin is now Three-fold
land. For the Three-Fold land and Two Rivers there are special guilds that
those coming from there may join, but there is no restriction as such to
what guild someone coming from any particular origin may join.

PKILLS PSTEALING

Pkilling and Pstealing, means the killing of, or stealing from, another
player. Since the Dragons Fang is basically a Roleplaying-MUD, these
actions will be frowned upon, unless they are an outcom of RP. Simply
to state that "I killed those smegheads because I'm a Darkfriend."
won't make your life easier.

Although Pstealing is annoying (well, think about it, some schmuck steals
all your hardearned gold) it's not nearly as annoying as being Pkilled,
mostly because you lose as much XP when killed by a player, that you do
when killed by a mob. So, if you wanna pkill, remember the golden rule,
"Don't do anything to people, you don't want people to do to you."

Player Killing (also known as PK) is allowed in Dragon's Fang,
and it is also IC, which would mean that the winner of any combat
session with another player gets to choose what happened (i.e.
if the loser was killed, or captured, etc).

BUT both parties have to agree that a Player Fight is going to take
place if one is to happen legally. You may -not- attack a player
without emotes (i.e. backstabbing or throwing a fireball) unless
that player has agreed that a PFight should take place.
What may count as Player Killing is anything that a player might find
unpleasant and is not done entirely in emotes. While that includes
direct damaging attacks (ones that take hit points and can kill),
it also includes restricting actions (gag, wrap, etc).

There is an exception to this , though.
If a player RPs a situation that leads to a Pfight , and declines to go
through with the Pfight , the Council may rule that a Pfight must take
place.
For example , if a player RPs an annoying fighter who deliberately taunts
another fighter into a Pfight , and then declines to actually fight , the
player may present his case to the Council (by contacting the 
HeadCouncilor) , and the Council can role in favour of a Pfight. This means 
that a pfight can occur either by consent of the two players or by a ruling 
of Council.

Moreover , one can dispute the outcome of a Pfight. If you think that the
outcome of a PFight is irrational , illegal , impossible , and so on , you may
approach the HeadCouncilor who will , in turn , bring the matter before the 
Council for a ruling.
Notice two important things , though. First , if you died in a Pfight ICly ,
you MAY NOT RP your dead char even if you dispute the Pfight , until and if 
the Council rules in favour of turning the outcome of the Pfight. Second , 
the Council has the right to decide not only that the PFight was legal , but
also that you brought the issue to the Council with unworthy intentions (as 
in , bringing it to Council just for kicks , or because you wanted to annoy 
another player). The Council can than decide to fine you with gold/qps.

The consequences of an illegal PK may be severe. If an Immortal spots an
illegal Pfight , or is called by a mortal to stop such a fight from occuring, 
he/she must stop the Pfight at once , and inform the HeadCouncilor. The 
HeadCouncilor will then bring this matter to the Council. The Council has 
the authority to judge severe punishments to illegal Pfighters ranging from 
loss of levels/qps/blademastery/gold/possesions to deguildment and public 
appology.

QUESTS QUESTPOINTS QUESTITEMS

  In Dragons Fang, the immortals sometimes arrange Quests, a much appreciated
diversion from the ordinary hack 'n slash or roleplay. The goal of these
quests can be to find certain items (given certain clues), defeat an
onslaught of Shadowspawn or a Trivia in which you get Quest Points (QP) for
your knowledge of the Wheel of Time, among other goals that vary depending
on the type of Quest the IMM is giving.
  Depending on how well you do this, you may get different amounts of QP,
and with these you can buy Questskills (very powerful skills that
enhances your character a lot), Questitems (items with boosted stats, some
of them better than any other on the mud) or perhaps convert them into
Trains (at trainers throughout the game).
  Harassing IMMs for quests will not only NOT get you a quest, but can
further irritate them, so don't do it please, through tells or on channels.

RACES

When creating your character, you will have a choice of races, or rather
your origin. One thing about races, is the fact that they're starting out
different stats, i.e. a Borderlander might have a bonus on strength, a
Cairhienin might have it on Intelligence. In the long run, this doesn't
really matter, since all races has max abilites of 30, whisch you can gain
by devoting some Trains on them. So why bother choosing a race anyway?

Well, first of all, if you're gonna play a Soldier, a race that gives a
higher Strength and Constitution might be a better choise, since then you
don't have to spend as much of your precious initial trains on those stats.

Secondly, with the HOME command, you will be transfered to the zone that
corresponds with your chosen race, I.e an Aiel might be transferd to
Rhuidean, a Seanchan will be transferd to Seandar. Sometimes, this might
be a good reason to be picky with your choise of race.

RBAJAHS
The Rebel Aes Sedai, situated in Salidar and split from the White Tower,
have these ajahs to choose from:

 \c07o \c10Brown Ajah\c00  - forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to
 seeking knowledge.
 \c07o \c07White Ajah\c00  - largely eschewing both the world and the value of 
worldly knowledge,
                     devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth.
 \c07o \c02Green Ajah\c00  - holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai'don, the battle

RBSEDAI REBELSEDAI REBELS
  The Rebel Sedai have fled the White Tower and Elaida (the current Amyrlin
of the White Tower). The coup was a reactionary act, supported by many
Aes Sedai for fear of a new and different Tower.
  It was feared that Siuan with her support of Rand would make the tower a
secondary, subject power in the world.  It was feared that the Tower would
have to diminish its influence, and change it s policies.
  The Rebel Aes Sedai gathered in Salidar have this fear, the reason they
opposed Elaida and the White Tower was that they viewed her coming to power
as unmoral and unjust. Even though they have a more open view of the Tower's
roles, its not that much different from Elaida's. Due to this split, there
was a lack of a Red Ajah in Salidar (Elaida had been a Red) and a lack of a
Blue Ajah in the White Tower (both Suian and Moiraine, engineers of Rand's
rise to become the Dragon Reborn, had been Blue).
  The Rebel Sedai are also gathering forces to return to the White Tower and
replace Elaida's claim to the Amyrlin Seat.

theme
  Dragon's Fang is a roleplaying MUD, set in the world of Robert Jordan's
wonderful bookseries "The Wheel of Time". We still do allow hack'n'slash
though, but we wish it mostly to be a complement to RP, not a substitute.
Becuse of our direction towards the WoT-series, we want people to choose
names that fit into the WoT-realms.

  This means, no characters named Tjoflojt, Killer, MasterBlaster, Terminator
SlaskTratt or similar. Also, even if the name might fit, don't choose to
wellknown names from other bookseries. For instance, Gandalf, Sauron, Saruman
Raistlin etc might be good names, they're too wellknown to be really good
names.

But, the main question remains, what the bl**dy `ell is roleplaying?

 A hard question to answer, since propably all people invovled in
roleplaying has different definitions. But roughly, you could say
that you make a character, give him a name, and try to think out a
so called 'background-story' for your character. Both name and story
should fit into the WoT-world. Now you log onto the game with your
character, and try to play him accordingly to how you figured your
character should behave in different situations. (Almost like acting).
So, all you have to do now, is to play your character, along with
other ppl from all the corners of the world, and try to have a really
good time. Only one thing is required: \c07creativity!\c00

One important hint though:

Do not use 'impossible' knowledge in your RP. For instance, if you see a
character in the city named Demandred, this is so called OOC-information.
You might now this player is a Forsaken, but your character won`t!

And perhaps the most important at all. Every player you meet on DF, will be
here to have fun, to RP in the WoT-world. So you should live by the golden
rule. Don't do anything towards others, you don't want others to do to you.

Roleplaying Experience
   
   Every character on Dragon's Fang can gain levels and increase their
power by leveling; this is usually done by killing mobs and being
awarded for it, but now there is another way to achieve that:
   When you Role Play in a room with someone else, you will start
receiving Experience Points for it - more as you continue, encouraging
long sessions over short ones. You and your partner(s) have to be IC at 
the time, and some following of good Rp etiquette will even grant you
better results - for example, if you have a doing for yourself.

rwarders rebel-warders
  The Rebel Warders are a group of elite warriors that fled the
White Tower in Tar Valon, center of Aes Sedai power, due to
circumstances, they felt were unjust and unlawful. The stilling
and rumored execution of Siuan Sanche, sent some of the Aes Sedai
in the White Tower, fleeing from the shining walls and as
faithful protectors of these powerful women, the Warders
accompanied their sworn charges in their flight. 
  Finding themselves in Salidar, the now Rebel Aes Sedai began to
consolidate their power, gathering more strength for their
eventual strike back at the White Tower and the perpetrator who
began the troubles between Aes Sedai, the false Amyrlin Seat,
Elaida. 
  The Warders have kept their skills well honed, continually
sweeping the forests around their Altaran strong hold, preventing
knowledge of their temporary seat of power, from spreading to Tar
Valon. 
  To assist in the retaking of the White Tower, this Rebel
organization has formed two other military machines, separate
from the elite Warders. The Rebel Watch and the Rebel Army, the
former led by the Blademaster and Warder Khorne, the latter by
former Captain General Gareth Bryne of the Queen's Armies in
Andor. These two new military forces will assist in the
dethroning of Elaida and the installation of who they feel, to
be the true Amyrlin Seat, Egwene. 

  To join the Rebel Warders, Watch, or Army,  you must fulfil the
following.

- Must not be capable of channeling.
- Must have a background mailed to Bailford and Alessio.
- Must be at least level 20.
- Must have a strong desire to roleplay.
- Must have five sponsors, two of which must be full Warders.

BLADEMASTER
  A title first bestowed in the Age of Legends for valiant
service and extreme skill with the blade, this very elite group
of swordsmen were given a blade rot of the Power,
causing it to be unbreakable, no matter the length of time or the
amount of use. These blades were bestowed with the mark of the
Heron, a stylized image of a bird that was etched into the steel
of the weapon. So marked, these unmatched masters of the blade,
survived the various wars that have marked the history of this
world and have descended into a group of about a hundred
swordsmen in current times. 
  Although the blades wielded by the contemporary masters have
lost their power-forged aspect, due to the Aes Sedai's inability
to make such weapons in present times, they do well with replicas
of the ancient weapons, the heron still a mark of their skill.
  To become a Blademaster, one must seek out a master and
convince him to teach you the advanced skill of their most elite
art. This training takes the form of years, sometimes more than
a decade, before the student succeeds or fails to gain
the heron. Another method is to challenge a Blademaster and take
his mark by defeating him in single, fair combat. This is rarely
done though it has occurred in the recent past and at various
points down through the ages. 
  On Dragon's Fang, we have modified the Blademaster seeking
system slightly, though we have tried to keep it as close to the
books as possible. Any wishing to become a Blademaster, must mail
Khenten and myself, (Cassin) applications which state your wish
to do so. You must include in this application the amount of time
you have played on the mud, whether you have skill or previous
training in emote fighting, how active you will be on the mud,
and various other bits that you think would set you above the
other applicants. Next, you must mail a background to the two 
of us, a background that must be fleshed out and well planned, we
want the best of the best to receive the Blademaster honor. This
does not mean you must be a Lan-type character, all steely
determination and unshakable confidence and strength. It means
you must be realistic, creative, reasonable and logical about
your background. 
  The Blademaster seekers will be narrowed down slightly to an
undetermined number, most likely three, though there may be more
who qualify to seek the Blademaster status. The seekers will be
given a certain length of time to complete their training with a
Blademaster and if they have not done so to the satisfaction of
the Blademaster or myself and Khenten, they will fail to become
one of the honored few. At this time, the process of Blademaster
seeking will be reopened for new seekers.  
  After the selection process has been completed, the seekers
will be taken to a Tourney, an event that will occur every
handful of months and that will be open to the mud to join and
enjoy. Anyone interested in fighting in such a Tourney, more
information will be available through prompting Cassin or Khenten
as to dates, times etc.
The Blademaster seekers will be observed and judged for their
emote fighting skill. When the Tourney is completed, the seekers,
if they are deemed good enough, will be able to follow rp along
until they come in contact with a Blademaster and will be
authorized to train under said Blademaster, pending the approval
of said Blademaster. The process will be explained further to
the seekers once they have reached the training stage so I will
not go into depth about it here but if there are any questions
concerning any aspect of this new system, please ask and your
inquiries will be answered swiftly.

BLADEMASTER_JUDGING "BLADEMASTER JUDGING"

Blademaster Judging System

There are four different ways to score in the tournament.

1) Your Background: this is submitted when you apply to be
   involved in the Blademaster tourney. It should consist of any
   training or conflict rp you have participated in and should also
   include some non-roleplayed history of your character. 

2) Elegance of Style: This category is taken into consideration
   when you are sparring an opponent. The Judge will take into
   consideration the grace of your motions, as well as the eloquence
   and verbosity of your emotes. This category has a maximum score
   of ten points.

3) Realism: this category is judged upon during your spar and
   consists of the logistics of your maneuvers both in offence and
   defence, the understanding of momentum and the physics of your
   maneuvers, taking into account the stature of your opponent and
   to spar accordingly in terms of physicality and finally the lack
   of a superhuman syndrome, to take hits when appropriate. This
   category is also given a ten point scoring.

4) Judge's discretion: This category, judged upon during the
   spar, is completely up to the judge's themselves. It takes into
   account all the miscellaneous factors in an emote spar, how much
   ooc clarification is necessary and asked for, ooc attitude,
   entertainment value and interest of the spar. This category is
   given a scoring of ten points.

The judging system in itself, is fairly simplistic. First, your
background is analyzed and given a score out of ten, which d
determines whether you are able to enter the tourney. The basic
score on your background required to participate is five points
of ten.

The other three categories are scored by the three judges from
the Blademaster council and are decided upon by either the judge
watching the spar or reading the logs of the spar. Each judge
gives a score out of ten for each category. The score for an
individual category is averaged out to give you a score of ten in
each category and therefore a maximum of 30 in the entire spar.
When you have completed your first spar in the first weekend,
you will have a score from your first spar, out of 30. When you
spar again, the same system as outlined above, will apply
exactly, giving you another score out of 30. The scores of your
first and second spars will be averaged together to give you a
score out of 30 points gained via sparring. When the background
is included at this point, you will have a maximum of 40 points.
The total scores will be announced at this point and the top six
participants, with the highest scoring, will be moved into the
final round, to be held a week exactly after the first day of the
first round. 

Your spar in the final round will  be judged exactly as the
first round was, therefore, another score of a maximum of 30 will
be announced and averaged into the scores from your first two
spars. The entire total for a single participant for the tourney
will be a maximum of 40 points, 10 for the background and three
spars of 30 which will all be averaged together to come up with a
score of 30 and then 40 when the background is added.

BLADEMASTER_TOURNEY "BLADEMASTER TOURNEY"

Blademaster tournament and structure

The structure of the Blademaster tourney is as follows.

- Once accepted into the Tournament, you will be required to
  spar twice in the initial round that will begin on a thursday and
  end on a Sunday, three days later. All 16 accepted participants
  will be matched up against one another to spar, a log of which
  will be sent, unedited, into  dfblademasters@egroups.com to be
  reviewed by the three judges. If you cannot log the spar,, ask
  your opponent to do so. Failing that, you may ask one of the
  Blademaster council members to invigilate the spar and to submit
  the log of the combat to the Egroups.

- After you have completed your first spar, your log will be
  analyzed and scored by the three judges and you will be given the
  appropriate score as has been laid out in the help Blademaster_
  judging file. No matter how you score, be it excellently or
  poorly, you will be given the opportunity to spar once again
  during that weekend and the same procedure concerning the logs
  stated above, will be followed.

- The score of the two spars that you participate in, will be
  averaged together to give you a maximum score of 30. The Six
  highest scoring participants of the Tourney will then advance to
  the second and final round, to be held on the thursday after the
  tourney began, exactly one week later.

- The six finalists will spar for a third and final time that
  weekend, the same logging procedure and scoring system applying
  as well. Once the three spars have been scored, the top three
  score holders, will be awarded Herons with honorable mention
  given to the other three finalists.

- Final note: If your assigned spar partner, for some reason,
  does not show up during the four days in the first or second
  round, you do not wait and get disqualified for their  inability
  to make the tourney. Merely ask one of the Bm council members,
  not currently judging the tourney, to spar you and you will be
  given a score based upon that spar.

BLADEMASTER_POLICY "BLADEMASTER_POLICY"

Anyone seeking the Heron, as well as current Blademasters
should read the following.

1) If wishing to enter a Tourney Email your background, both
   character history and rped history, to
   dfblademasters@egroups.com. It is suggested but not required,
   that you submit a spar along with the background  as a small
   example of your emote fighting abilities.

2) There will never be more than ten Blademasters on the game.
   They are held to an activity level thus if they do go inactive,
   spots will open but ten is the maximum.

3) There will be no more than five Blademasters per guild and a
   maximum of eight Warders is built into this cap, to allow for
   diversity in the Heron.

4) No blademaster may have more than one prodigy. Thus, if you
   are asking a current Blademaster to prodigy you and he or she
   already has one, it  won't be allowed and you will be forced to
   seek the heron either through prodigying yourself to another Bm
   or by entering a tourney.

5) You may not have more than one Blademaster character. This
   rule does not apply to Blademaster book characters.

6) You may have a Blademaster and a Prodigy or a blademaster and
   a Respected but not all three nor two of any save Respected.

7) Channeler blademasters are strongly discouraged. While
   channelers may, if  their backgrounds are reasonable, participate
   in the tournament, they will be strongly  handicapped score-wise
   in an attempt to attain a heron-marked blade. This policy does
   not affect  the Respected ranking.

8) Randland's swordmasters are a male-dominated group ICly. In
   acknowledging this, like channelers, while females are welcome
   to participate in the tournament if their  backgrounds and
   training are reasonable, they will be strongly handicapped
   score-wise in  an attempt to attain a heron-marked blade. This
   be played by a non book character blademaster, the only
   circumstance under which someone may  have two characters with
   the heron marked blade. A book character blademaster gets the 
   sword, and the pretitle. They may not take on a prodigy, or
   otherwise sponsor  blademastery seekers or teach blademastery
   skills. In the event of the death of a book character in  any way
   for any reason, the heron marked sword must be taken out of play,
   either by being  returned to the guild armory, if appropriate,
   being lost to shadowspawn, or otherwise being  destroyed. Book
   Character players will not be offered the blademaster title on
   another alt in the event of the book character's death. Forsaken
   will be set to the rank "Unknown", the only Forsaken blademaster 
   currently alive is Sammael. Book characters, such as Galad and
   Gawyn, who should have the Respected or  Prodigy rankings ICly,
   will receive it. 

10) A Veteran blademaster may not take on a prodigy, or otherwise
    sponsor blademastery seekers or teach blademastery skills. In
    the event of the death of a Veteran  blademaster, the heron
    marked sword must be taken out of play, either by being returned
    to the  guild armory, if appropriate, being lost to shadowspawn,
    or otherwise being destroyed.  Veteran players will not be
    offered the blademaster title on another alt in the event of 
    their death. Moving veterans from "Veteran" to "Blademaster" or
    Unknown status will be handled  on a case by case basis by the
    committee, likely based on the activity of the veteran,  the
    status of the caps when the request is made, why they went
    inactive in the first place,  and possibly the submission of some
    spars.

11) The Death of Blademasters:  Please see the "Book Character"
    and "Veteran" sections regarding the death  of people with these
    ranks. Respected always have the option of transferring their
    title to another  character provided that the IC requirements for
    Respected are met. Blademaster and Unknown ranked individuals
    when killed by NPCs or in any  fashion other than a fair
    sword-to-sword combat, will be permitted to choose another alt, 
    including the rename, to receive their blademaster status,
    subject to background approval of the  committee, and the caps.
    If the blademaster does not wish another blademaster alt, their 
    spot remains open for the next tournament. The sword of the
    character who dies must be  taken out of play, either by being
    returned to the guild armory, if appropriate, being lost to 
    shadowspawn, or otherwise being destroyed. If a Blademaster or
    Unknown ranked individual is killed by fair  sword-to-sword
    combat, a log of the combat must be sent to the committee, along
    with the background and  IC training of the killer. The committee
    will then convene to determine the disposition of  the heron
    marked sword. Until a ruling is made the sword is to be
    considered out of play.  Either the killer will be granted the
    heron marked sword, or the combat will be treated the  same as
    any other blademaster death as described in the previous
    paragraph. This method of  attaining the heron marked sword is
    discouraged, and far from guaranteed. 

12) Powerforged blades: First, while they may be decorated
    differently, all powerforged blades are  identical in shape and
    size. Second, allocations on powerforged blades will remain the
    same for all  current blademasters. The awarding of power-wraught
    blades to future blademasters will be based on  whether the
    blademaster wants one, IC factors, and some random factor to be
    determined by the council. Codewise the only difference between
    powerforged and normal heron-marked  blades (with the exception
    of Lan's and Rand's which are treated differently for a variety
    of reasons), is that, to reflect the slightly better balance of
    a powerforged blade, they  have a slightly better average damage.
    The maximum damage and all other affects are the  same.

RWARDER_RANKS

Student
----------------------
When a man, or boy joins the Tower in hopes of becoming a Warder,
he must first become a Student. In this short period of time he
must show his knowledge in the blade and in other things that would
be desired from a Sedai. Once a Student makes the oath to become
a Trainee, he can never turn back.

Trainee
----------------------
When a man goes through the student stage and passes, he becomes a
trainee. This starts his life in the ways of the Warder. Trainee is the
harshest time for a Warder, and since the Tower has been Broken
moer Warders are needed. If a Trainee passes his Training he becomes
part of the Tower Guard.

Tested
-------------------------
A Trainee who in terms in no longer a Trainee. He has proven himself to
his Instuctors and has stabilized his standing within the Guild. He
has gained the Cloak, but not been Bonded. This Rank is either a Life
Long rank or a waiting period to becoming bonded.


Warder
----------------------------
A Warder is a Trainee who has finally gained the Cloak, and has become
Bonded.
Some warders have gone straight from Trainee to Bonded, but most
Warders were part of the Tower Guard at some point. This is the most common
rank in the Guild.

Instructor
-----------------------------
An Instructor is a Warder, who knows the forms and the ways of battle.
He also knows the ways of tracking and in short the most effiecient
ways to protect and keep the Sedai safe. They are the best Warders,
and teach the other on how to improve themselves.

Gaidin
-----------------------------
Gaidin is a basic honor Rank. These are Instructors who either
have been promoted through constant ability, or that Warder who would
be an Instructor but is constantly out in the World with his Sedai.
A Gaidin is supposed to be the same Ranking as an Instructor but it
has been known that some Gaidin have even respect from a
Master of Trainees.

Master of Trainees
-----------------------------
There can only be 1 to 3 Master of Trainees at once. These Warders
are Instructors who are the recruiters, and the Trainers of the Students and
Trainees. Only The highest devoted and respected Warder ever attains
such a Rank.

SEANCHAN SEANDAR

        The Empire of the Seanchan has a long and detailed history.
Descendants from the Empire of Hawking, these people crossed the Arynth
sea long ago to settle the land of Seandar. Subduing the warring
people of the continent, the people under Luthair Paendrag brought
order and peace to the land.
        Such a victory was not without a price. The Aes Sedai of the
area had caused so much strife and conflict that the Seanchan felt
necessary to make sure that no such problem would plague their Empire.
The a'dam was created, and a legacy was born. Taming the Aes Sedai
along with the fantastical beasts brought in from other worlds during
the Age of Legends, the Seanchan conquered the entire continent and
beat back the Blight.
        After a time, a complex cast system began to evolve, taken directly
from the culture of the conquerers, and from the beaten people. Slavery
was never completely stomped out by Hawking's people, and began to make
its way into their culture. A rigid hierarchy formed, with those directly
related to the Blood of Hawking as rulers of the Empire. The beaten
people took lower cast positions as slaves, and the lower classes.
        As time went on, lines became blurred. Some slaves rose to
great power in the ruling houses. They were known as so'jhin, a slave
who ran a house in the name of their Lord. Members of the Blood changed
as well, people were awarded the titles of nobility for acts they
committed in the name of the Empire.
        With their Empire solidified, the Empress of the Seanchan began
to make plans for the return of her people to the land of Hawking. Much
to her suprise, the people of Hawkings land had not kept their promises
to him and kept his empire together. They had degenerated and fought
amongst themselves for power. Outraged, the Seanchan swore to bring
these Oathbreakers back into line and re-establish the glory and splendor
of the Empire that Hawking built.
        The Seanchan of this mud are currently in hiding, spying on the
Oathbreakers after the failed assault of the Seanchan forces at Falme.
They wish to collect data about the Oathbreakers to better help them
in their war, and to strike out when possible to capture rouge Aes Sedai
to leash them and make them damane.

SEANCULTURE

        The Seanchan culture is completely different than any other
unique culture in the Wheel of Tyme series. It has a very different
feel than that of say the Aiel, or of Shara.  Some things that set them
apart, and used to differentiate them, are their bug-shaped armor and the
soft slur their speech has from being used to speaking both common
language and the Old Tongue.
        In many ways, the Seanchan are obsessed with honor. Honor
in their station, honor to their Empire, honor on even how their hair
is cut and their nails are painted. An easy example to relate them
to in real life would be that of the Japanese.
        Eye contact is very important to the Seanchan. Those who are of
a lower station should not make direct eye contact with those of a higher
station. To be allowed such is a great honor. This rules applies all
the way up in the Seanchan infrastructure to the Empress, who no one is
allowed to look directly at her face without permission.
        Bowing is another important aspect to Seanchan culture. The higher
the status the person, the lower the bow they would receive. Bowing
to a person of the same status would simply be a nod to the other, while
bowing to a Lady of a House or someone higher, is done on the knees
while prostrating onto the floor. To the Empress, a full stomach bow
is required.
        Channeling is very taboo in the Seanchan culture. Anyone who
can channel is in danger of either death or permanent enslavement,
depending on the sex. If a male is found who can channel, he is killed
for fear that he will go mad and destroy property or lives. If a female
is found who can channel, she is linked to a sul'dam who holds an a'dam.
The girl is now a damane, a slave used for her abilities in furthering
the goals of the Empire.

SEANREQS

        The requirements to become a member of the Seanchan guild
are as follows.

SEANRP

Role-playing in the Seanchan guild is quite a bit different than 
role-playing in other guilds. Life is very stratified and one almost
always obeys orders from those above them. Life is orderly and SC
society, and almost all from Seanchan like it that way. One must learn
quickly when to bow, and how much to bow before a higher ranked
person, and what to expect from other people's bows.

Life is strict, and life is hard. Most people who have come to fight
the oathbreakers know how to fight, and fight well. They have little
to no compassion for the lawless types who prey upon others or whom
consort with marath'damane.

There are always expceptions, but those people generally are viewed
with a suspicious mind by the other in SC.

A point to note is that Ogier in Seandar do not generally act like
the passive Ogier in the lands of Hawking. Here, Ogier are much more
fierce, and ready to do battle. They cannot be owned as slaves, but
often enter into the service of the military to future the might of
the Empire.

We welcome all who would like to enter the service of the Empire and
help make the lawless lands of Hawking a better place to live. We are
not all slavers bent on hurting as many people as we can. That is not
the goal of the Seanchan. The goal is to return the law and stability
that was lost after the death of Aurtur Hawking, in any means possible.
So come join us, you might be suprised.

SHOPS SHOPKEEPERS

 Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

 To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop
by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers
are often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed,
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end. Not
only that, killing or stealing from shopkeepers is considered \c02CHEATING\c00
and will not be tolerated by IMMortals. At All.

SKILLS

Depending on what class you have chosen, you can gain and train certain
skills (to see what skills are available to you, type "skills").
These skills are bought with Trains and trained with Practices, both
which you get when you increase in levels.
These skills can only be bought and trained at certain places where there
are trainer mobs, which are placed at certain spots throughout the mud.

If the skill in the "skills" list has an RP next to it instead of a level,
it means you need to be instructed that skill by someone else that has it.

SPEARMASTERY BLADEMASTERY

Usage: Automatic

This questskill kicks in automatically once a fight begins.
It gives you +30 hitroll, +30 damroll and -10 AC.
#0
STATS

  The stats you have (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, Hitpoints, Movement points, Mana points, the five flows)
are not set in stone. You can increase those if you have Trains, and this
is how you do it:
  Increasing Str, Con, Dex, Int, Wis, Cha, Hit, Move or Mana and the five
flows can be done at the proper trainer, which can be found at several
places.
  Just type the name of the stat, and if it is anything but the five flows
and you have Trains enough, you increase it by 1 (for Str, Con,
Dex, Int, Wis and Cha) or 10 (for Move, Mana and HP).

  Raising Move, Mana or Hp by 10 always costs 1 Train, the other stats cost
more the higher they are (1 per step up to 18, 2 up to 25, 3 up to 30).
Be careful not to use all the Trains for stats, they are used to buy
skills and spells as well.

The five flows (Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit and Water) cost Trains to 
raise as well, one to increase one of them by one step.

You gain Pracs and Trains when you reach a new level.

A'DAM

  Device created by the Seanchan.  It is a ter'angreal:  a collar and
bracelet linked together by a leash, all of silver.  A woman who can be
taught to channel wear the bracelet and control the woman born with the
spark and wears the collar.  It creates a link between the two women.
When complete, the Sul'dam know what the Damane is doing with the Power.
The Damane can not channel without the Sul'dam permission or she will get
sick. The more Power she will draw without permission, the sicker she will
become.
  Both women are aware of the other's feeling, like anger, fear
and, sadness, although the Sul'dam can control what feelings are shared
through the leash.  The Sul'dam can make the Damane feel things through
the a'dam, like pain or pleasure. The Damane can not touch any weapon, nor
anything she think of as a weapon, or she will get sick.  The Damane can
not move the bracelet of the a'dam when no Sul'dam wears it.  The farther
she will try to move it, the sicker she will become, until unconsciousness.
  When a Damane and a Sul'dam are joined, whatever the Sul'dam feels, the
Damane feels ten times over, even to death.  It is why a Damane may never
strike at her Sul'dam, but she must protect her even more than herself.
If the leash of the a'dam is broken when a Damane and a Sul'dam wear the
a'dam, they die.  If a man who can channel touches the a'dam, both women
suffer, as if shocked, from the touch.  If a man who channels wears the
a'dam, he will die and so will the sul'dam if any, the listeners in the
Raven Tower use the A'dam as a questioning tactic, and torture.  A'dams
do not work on women that can not channel.

A'dam are restricted to the Seanchan guild. The only means of obtaining one
is to join the guild, or have a speical conference with the GL.

TER'ANGREAL

Ter'angreals are as San'greals and Angreals, items of the One Power.
But, Ter'angreals doesn't increase the ammount of the One Power you
can channel. Instead, they're designed to use the One Power in a
special way. Examples of this are the stone ringg Egwene is given by
Verin to access Tel'aran'rhiod, or the balefire-producing rod stolen
by the Black Ajah.

Not as rare as *greals, Ter'angreals are still not very common, and
the White Tower will surely lay claim on it.

"TOWER SEDAI"
Tower Aes Sedai Guild
=====================
     The Tower Aes Sedai guild is a roleplay guild, and hence, roleplay is
greatly emphasized within the guild.  Only the best roleplayers will be added
to the ranks of this guild.  If you are lucky enough to become a member of
the guild, you will most likely start as a Novice.  The basic rankings
most members will see are Novice, Accepted and Aes Sedai.  Those few who
are elected by their Ajahs may become Sitters in the Hall of the Tower,
or even Leader of their Ajah.  The Tower Aes Sedai guild also has places
for Protectorates (those who seek the Protection of the Tower, but either
do not channel, or do not wish to become Aes Sedai), and Prisoners (those
who the Tower takes as Prisoner for a period of time, for some
reason).
        A Novice's life is one of chores, learning, meekness,
duty and strict rules.  A Novice never speaks to an Aes Sedai, unless
spoken to first, and obeys an Aes Sedai's word without question (failing
to do so usually gets a sharp lecture from the Aes Sedai, which is all in
the spirit of roleplay!).  Novices are given instruction by Accepted and
Aes Sedai.  They are taught the basics of using the One Power; how to
grasp and release, identifying each of the five flows and how to weave
each of the five flows.  Novices are restricted to the White Tower, and
may not even enter the city of Tar Valon without an Aes Sedai's
permission as well as an escort (be it a Warder or an Aes Sedai).
***It is worth noting at this point that for RP purposes, a Novice may go
anywhere on the mud ICly, so as not to restrict RP, BUT, if caught by a
Warder or an Aes Sedai, such a Novice should *expect* to be *severely*
punished, ICly (ie, switchings, extra chores, or anything else an Aes
Sedai or the Amyrlin can think of!). When a Novice is deemed to have
suitable control of the One Power, and able to recognize the flows, weave
them to a certain aptitude and has the correct attitude, she is raised to
the Accepted.
        An Accepted's life is somewhat less confined by
rules than a Novice's, and they are allowed to choose their own areas of
study, within limits.  They also may not leave the White Tower without the
permission of an Aes Sedai as well as an escort (be it a Warder, Student,
Trainee or Aes Sedai).  An Accepted may speak to an Aes Sedai without
being spoken to first, but should always be respectful and meek (else face
rebuke by the Aes Sedai if she takes offense to the Accepted's tone!).
When an Accepted is deemed to have reached a suitable level of control,
knowledge, strength and skill in the One Power (and attitude) she is
raised to the Shawl.  Part of what an Accepted learns entails learning how
to weave complex weaves with the One Power, how to tie off weaves and
flows, history, and this on top of their chosen areas of study.
       When an Accepted is raised to the Shawl, she becomes Aes Sedai
and chooses her Ajah.  There are seven Ajahs:  the Red, the White, the
Green, the Grey, the Brown, the Yellow and the Blue, however only the
first six are present within the Tower Aes Sedai.  If you wish to become
Blue Ajah, best to seek out those darn Rebels! *grin*  An Aes Sedai may
do as she pleases, as long as it does not break Tower Law.  The Ajah an
Aes Sedai chooses tends to dictate what her actions will be as Aes Sedai,
and to what she will lend her energies for the course of her life.
Type HELP AJAH to learn about the Ajahs.
        A Sitter is an Aes Sedai who has been raised by her Ajah to the
Hall of the Tower - an esteemed position among Aes Sedai.
The Hall consists of three Sitters from each Ajah (all but the Blue in t
he case of the Tower Aes Sedai).  While the Amyrlin Seat
is by law the absolute power in the White Tower, in fact her power has
always depended on how well she could lead, manage or intimidate the Hall,
as there are many ways that the Hall can balk any Amyrlin's plans.  Thus,
a Sitter is an Aes Sedai who helps govern the White Tower, under the
Amyrlin and Keeper, and who holds some sway among all Aes Sedai.  Because
of this, Sitters are normally accorded a tad more respect over 'normal'
Aes Sedai (though not so much that they are revered).
        Ajah Leaders are those Aes Sedai that are elected by their Ajah
to lead that Ajah.  For each Ajah there is only one Ajah Leader, elected
by a majority vote (and incidentally they can be removed by a majority vote
among the Ajah). Within the Ajah, an Ajah Leader's word is as equal to the
Amyrlin's; outside of the Ajah, an Ajah Leader's word is simply that of
another Aes Sedai's.  Normally, no one outside of an Ajah will know that
Ajah's Leader, and normally the members of an Ajah will give the Leader
a title to show she is of some importance.
        Protectorates are people who seek the protection of the
Tower for a time.  They are usually not permanent members, and thus can
make for some interesting roleplay. Protectorates usually do not channel
(if they do, they may well find themselves bullied into becoming a Novice).
The Tower will offer protection to nearly anyone in need of it (OOCly, you
must clear this with the Tower Aes Sedai GL first, probably best done through
a mudmail stating your intentions, and roleplay with other Aes Sedai, or the
Tower Aes Sedai GL herself - though it may not be easy to get to see her 
ICly *wink*).
        Prisoners are those people Aes Sedai deem necessary to hold within
the walls of the White Tower for a period of time.  Again, this should be
cleared with the Tower Aes Sedai GL beforehand via a mudmail stating your 
intentions and why you want to be taken prisoner.  In the case of belonging 
to another guild, please check with your guild leader (GL) *before* mailing the
 
Tower Aes Sedai GL or beginning RP which may lead to you being taken prisoner. 
 
Of course, Prisoners do not *have* to be added to the guild - it may
simply be RP'd the whole way, if you wish.
        On the whole, however, the Tower Aes Sedai guild exists
for roleplay. We do not encourage leveling, though we do not restrict
it.  We *do* prefer our members to roleplay, however, and thus try to
create the best atmosphere for roleplaying.  Within the Tower, if you do
not agree with something ICly, then try to change it, ICly, by roleplaying
(this could be anything, from something an Aes Sedai is doing, or
something the Hall is considering, to something the Amyrlin is doing!).
If you love roleplay, then roleplay now fora position among the Tower Aes
Sedai - but read the requirements first!

WARDER GAIDIN

WARDER: (1)In the Old Tongue, "Gaidin", which means "Brother to Battles".
A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai.  The bonding is a thing of the One Power:
By it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods
without food, water, or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark
One at a distance.  So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is
bonded knows he is alive, however far away he is, and when he dies she will
know the moment and manner of his death.  The bonding seems weaker at a
distance, and the Warder knows precisely in what direction his Sedai lies in
relation to him.
While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a
time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, and the Green Ajah
believes an Aes Sedai may bond as many as she wishes.  Ethically, the Warder
must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to be done
against the Warder's will.
What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is a closely held secret.

TP "TRUE POWER"

The True Power
  Bestowed only by the blessing of the Dark One, this tremendous
source of power, is given only to Shai'tan's most trusted servants.
Being a weapon which cuts both ways, this power is drawn directly
from the Great Lord, rather than Saidin or Saidar. Its advantages
allow the wielder to use this dark energy independent of the One
Power, still being able to channel the horrific blessing even if
the wielder is severed from Saidin or Saidar. Besides being
extremely lethal, the True Power extracts a price from the
wielder as well, driving him or her to madness, much as the
taint on Saidin. The Saa, black dots that appear in one's eyes,
is the only known physical indicator of oncoming insanity.

"TWO RIVERS"
Two Rivers is not its own country, but rather a part of Andor, though the
Two Rivers has not seen a taxman in five generations. Two Rivers shares
the western borderline with Tarabon, and the southern with Ghealdan. In
the  time up to the Trolloc Wars, however, the Two Rivers was known as
Manetheren, and was led by King Aemon, whose  home, then Aemon's Field,
over time became known as Emond's Field. Manetheren had a small but
extremely skilled army, and were often where the battle was fiercest, and
were known as the thorn in the Dark One's foot and the bramble in his
hand. Manetheren did not last, however - an attack on Manetheren of
unheard of proportions was intercepted by the Manetheren army that had
marched faster than a rested army, despite having little food and no sleep
for days. Promised reinforcements in three days if they could hold off an
attack that should have overwhelmed them in hours, Manetheren fell on the
tenth day - no reinforcements had arrived. King Aemon fell, but as his
wife felt Aemon die from within the safety of the Mountains of Mist with
the rest of the evacuated villagpeople, the Dark One's generals and
Dreadlords were engulfed by fire from within, (wife) channeling so much of
the Power as to kill herself as the Dark One's minions bruned in agony.
Not a single trolloc, fade or dreadlord that stepped foot on Manetheren
soil lived to escape, but Manetheren was gone.

However, Manetheren has been rediscovered in the Two Rivers, as the
manetheren blood is still strong, perhaps as strong as it was those many
years ago. Led by Lord Perrin 'Goldeneyes' Aybara and his beautiful, and
wife Lady Faile, Manetheren's flag was raised again, and the Two Rivers
once again is becoming the thorn in the Dark One's side; the bramble in
his hand.

\c14Geography:\c00
Bordered by the River Taren to the north, The White River (also known as
Manetherendrelle) and Forest of Shadows to the south, the Waterwood to the
east, and The West Wood, Sand Hills and Mountains of Mist to the west. The
main road runs north-south just east of the Westwood, starting at Taren
Ferry (on the River Taren) and continuing through Watch Hill, Emond's
Field and Deven Ride to the White River. From taren Ferry to Emond's Field
it is called the North Road. From Emond's Field to the White River, it is
called the Old Road. Heading west from Emond's Field into the Mountains
of Mist is Quarry Road, pathway to the Two Rivers' mines, aside from the
farming, the most important resources in the area. Emond's Field sits on
the Winespring, a natural fountain that flows east to form the miry Waterwood.

\c14Councils:\c00
Each village, from Taren Ferry on the River Taren, south  to Watch Hill,
Emond's Field and finally Deven Ride, which lies close to the White River,
is governed by the Village Council, a group of men with the town's Mayor
as leader, deciding and ruling the affairs of the village. Also in each
village is the Women's Circle, a similar group of women, who, amongst
other things, assist the village Wisdom, a woman with the ability to hear
the wind, though not all Wisdoms actually have this ability. The Village
Wisdom also knows much about healing, and herbs, medicines and cures, and
is the village's doctor.
Another job of the Women's Circle is to decide when a girl may braid her
hair; this signifies  girl's growing up into a woman. When a girl's hair
is braided, it means (amongst other things) that she is ready to marry,
though not required to do so. Before a couple can be married, they must be
betrothed (read: engaged) for one year. This is so the couple, and Women's
Circle can judge on whether the couple should be married.

\c14Festivals:\c00 Festival is the name given when refering to Winternight and 
Bel
Tine. Winternight celebrates the end of winter, and villagers go from
house to house, exchanging gifts and eating and drinking into the night.
The day following is Bel Tine, celebrating springtime. During Bel Tine
there are camp stories, singing and dancing, and occasionally fireworks or
even a gleeman. Bel Tine is also feast day, and a chance for everyone to
forget themselves in dance and song, something Two Rivers folk need little
excuse to do.

\c14People of Two Rivers:\c00 Two Rivers' people are of middling height, with
 dark
eyes, and dark hair. Consisting mainly of farmers (wool and tabac the main
'crops'), Two Riversmen are strong and stubborn to the bone. Though
winters are long ard cold, with deep snow that can damage crops, this
seldom stops them from continuing on with their lives. When they are
knocked over, they take little time worrying before standing up and
starting again, which gave birth to the saying "If times are tough, then
light willing, we'll get through, and if the light isn't willing, we'll
get through anyway." This never-say-die attitude is thanks partly to the
blood of Manetheren, which is still strong in the people of Two Rivers.
This trait runs throughout all Two Riversmen, though people from Taren
Ferry have a reputation for slyness and trickery, and there are two
families, the Coplins and the Congars, who are known as whiners and
trouble-makers.
Recently, many refugees have come to the Two Rivers, as it is a relatively
safe place in a world that seems on the brink of collapse.

TUATHA'AN TINKERS

Greetings Friends, allow me to guide you through the information about
the Tuatha'an. First things first, I will show you a little about the
Tuatha'an culture and beliefs. A typical Tinker camp consists of a
number of brightly colored wagons, brightly clothed people, music,
laughter, and song, as if the inhabitants are having a celebration.
The Tinkers themselves strive to have a happy life; occupationally
they are usually singers, dancers, musicians, and especially artisans
and craftsman. The Tinkers are nomadic; their camps never settle in
one place for long, for they must always travel in search of the
Song and to spread peace known as the Way of the Leaf. They travel
in large wagons built to act as homes or crafting shops. The latter
are reinforced and more than twice the weight of a normal wagon,
the Tinkers having found a way to hold larger tools of the craft
such as forges and spits. Crafting is not only with metal, however,
as the Tuatha'an also find themselves tailoring clothing, setting
jewelry, or even mending sails.

The Tuatha'an have a very unique view on life called the Way of the Leaf.
This lifestyle is pacifistic; a Tuatha'an would rather run than fight.
It is believed that violence not only causes harm and injury to the victim,
but also to the attacker, and so a Tuatha'an will run not in fear but to
not hurt his aggressor. Within the camp, visitors are quietly asked to remove
their weapons out of respect to the Way. This lifestyle is strange to most
of the rest of the world in the day and age of strife, yet the Tinkers travel
through it with optimism. Their quiet, happy ways tend to draw many people
away from the villages they past, and for such, the Tuatha'an are often
called Child Stealers and shunned from towns despite the craftwork they
can help do.

The main goal of the Tinkers is not to convert everyone to pacifism, but
to find the long lost Song. It is believed that when the Song is found
peace will simply return to the lands. And so they dedicate their lives
traveling from place to place in search, helping all they can along the way.
For further information about the Guild, read the Requirement board and
speak with as many Tuatha'an as you can. The Mahdi (Guildleader) is also
always happy to answer any questions you may have.

TINKERREQS

You may wish to read the Guild Requirement board at Recall in order to
see a more detailed description of each of these:
1. A belief in pacifism
2. A background sent to the Guildleader
3. A description that resembles a Tuatha'an
4. Any level, preferrably level 1, as Tinkers do not kill
5. 3 sponsors who mail their sponsorship to the GL
   (less if the guild is small. Check with the GL)

Note that if you have a character from another guild or mud location and
later choose to follow the Way of the Leaf for IC reasons, come roleplay
with the Tuatha'an, and it will be decided if you can stay.

WETLANDERS
  Aiel refer to those that are non-Aiel as wetlanders, and especially the
people who live to the west of the Spine of the World. They regard
wetlanders as one would a child - weak, soft and not intelligent enough
to comprehend the ways of the Aiel (especially Ji'e'Toh, which is never
applied to wetlanders).
  Killing a wetlander would not result in Toh towards the wetlander or his
clan. However, raiding and killing wetlanders merely for the sake of killing
is frowned upon (as were the Shaido, who practiced this after they turned
upon the other clans).
  Taking wetlanders Gai'shain is considered useless, as wetlanders do not
have the capacity for understanding Ji'e'toh, and may result in the
outcasting of the person (or clan, take the Shaido) who does this.

"WAY OF THE LEAF"
  The \c02Way of the Leaf\c00 is a nonviolent way that is the code of the
Tuatha'an people, the Traveling Folk - who would rather run away from danger
than cause violence to someone.
  The Way of the Leaf is simple - as the leaf bends to the will of the wind,
so shall the Tuatha'an. They believe that violence not only causes harm and
injury to the victim, but it also causes harm to the one who is perpetrating
the violence - When you chop down a tree, the tree is harmed by the fall of

WOLFKIN WOLFBROTHERS

Some think that it is a gift from the Creator, others believe it to be a
curse of the Dark One, yet for those with the ability to speak to the
wolves, they know beyond all doubt that it is nothing of the Shadow, for
the wolves that speak only in their minds voice an intense hatred of
anything Dark and those that serve it.

Those that hear the wolves call themselves the Wolfkin (adapted from the
book Wolfbrother - as women also hear wolves on the mud), and they come
from all walks of life, from simple soldiers of the borderlands, to
minor nobles of the southern countries. Only those who spend enough time
out of doors, away from the cities and bustle of civilization, will ever
develop the true rapport between themselves and the wolves. Those who are
born with the ability to hear the wolves but never leave their comforts
never gain their true calling with the wolves, possibly living their entire
lives without realizing what it is they missed. Only those that leave the
cities are approached by the wolves, whether they wish the contact or not.
Once contact has been made, there is no going back. Slowly, their eyes
will change to the same golden color as the wolves' eyes, their mannerisms
becoming more animalistic and their cravings turning towards blood and raw
meat. Their outbursts of temper tend to be more severe and their ability
in battle escalates to match the animalistic verocity of a fighting wolf.

All wolfkin run the danger of losing themselves to the urges of the
wolf, their minds turned completely from their humanity to the point
that, while they still are human in shape, they think, act, and are a
wolf in every other way possible. Once this condition is reached, there
is no cure and death is only a matter of weeks or days away, as no human
can survive as a wolf does for any long period of time. Known as the
"Lost", these wolfkin are usually avoided by those wolves and wolfkin
that not know them before they lost their mind.

Wolfkin are typically loners, avoiding large cities and crowds,
preferring to camp in the forests rather than stay at an inn or in a
city. Some wolfkin even avoid other wolfkin, keeping to themselves and
the wolves alone, shunning all contact with any humans at all. Others
avoid the wolves in the same manner, trying to ignore the whisperings
that enter their minds and the strange urges of the wolves that may
take them to places within themselves that they did not want to find. A
few, and a small few at that, have learned how to balance the human and
wolf sides of their nature, earning the respect of the wolves. Guided by
the wolves to find those kin that are new to the callings, these wolfkin
strive to assist these new "cubs" through their first few months, helping
them to cope with the new world they have found themselves thrust into.

One cannot seek out the wolves and their kin, any attempt to do so will
end in failure. Instead, one must wait to be sought after to achieve
the best results. Those who prove themselves worthy will find themselves
among a pack of new friends.

WOLFTALK

All wolfkin are able to speak to the wolves through their minds, and
through the wolves they may pass messages on to other wolfkin if they
choose. The wolves do not comprehend words, either spoken, thought or
written; wolfkin can only communicate with the wolves through images,
emotions, and scents. Messages such as these can be passed from wolf to
wolf, pack to pack, all across the continent in a matter of hours.

Wolfkin are able to speak with the wolves while awake, no matter what
else their condition is, either drugged, gagged, or bound. However, they
can only speak to the wolves with conscious effort, and are not able to
relay information while unconscious unless they are asleep and enter the
World of Dreams.

WOLFDREAM

After spending some time amongst the wolves, wolfkin will eventually
learn how to enter and navigate the Unseen World, the World of Dreams,
Tel'aran'rhiod. The wolves exist in both worlds, the real and the world
of dreams. Death in the real world means nothing to the part of the wolf
which lives in the Dream, yet death in the Dream is the only form of
permanent death that a wolf can know. This link the wolves have with
the Dream gives wolfkin somewhat of an edge there, as wolves will come
to their aid if called in the Dream.

Moving about and interacting in the Dream is different for wolfkin than
for other dreamers. Wolfkin tend to see things in symbolic form, rather
than realistic ones. For a detailed example, see the situation with Perrin
tracking down Faile in Tel'aran'rhiod in the books. Other dreamers would
not have been able to do what Perrin did. Wolfkin also may not "jump" to
places as most dreamers have been described doing. Instead, they simply
travel the intervening space in one blurred movement - achieving the
same result, but with a different appearance. A wolfkin will not suddenly
appear and disappear, but instead "smear" and blur out to the new
location as if stepping rapidly from one place to another. Dreaming for
a wolfkin is not learned so much as it is instinctual, which makes it
difficult for one wolfkin to teach another directly. The one ability
which seems to remain the same for both wolfkin and regular Dreamers
is creating and destroying items through sheer force of will.

WKGUILD

Only guilded wolfkin have access to the Wolftalk channel and the other
code benefits of being a wolfkin. If you wish to be one of those wolfkin
that interacts only with the wolves and not other wolfkin, then speak to 
the GL.

Wolftalk (wt) should be used only in an IC manner if at all possible. Some
OOC communication is allowed, but it is asked that it be kept to a minimum.

A wolfkin's rank within the guild reflects the amount of knowledge they
have about wolfkin and the wolves, as well as the level of trust the
wolves have placed on that person. Some wolfkin choose to act as
protectors of other wolfkin and the wolves, others behave more asden
mothers looking after the more vulnerable, and yet others actively seek
other wolfkin needing guidance. These roles are not reflected in a
rank within the guild; rather it is left up to those who wish to assume
such duties to act as they see fit.

Some commands to remember once in the guild:
  wolfranks - displays ranks in the guild
  who -w - shows wolfkin online

WOT "\c07WHEEL OF TIME\c00"
  "The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that
  become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten
  when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the
  Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose
  in the Mountains of the Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are
  neither beginnings or endings in the Wheel of Time. But it was _a_
  beginning." - EotW

 The Wheel of Time started thus, a single book published in 1990 by a man
some named Robert Jordan. This book detailed the journey of a small band
of Two River's Folk - their flight from fists of Trollocs and several
Fades, their journey into self-discovery and adventure. Rand al'Thor,
Perrin Aybara, and Matrim Cauthon were the trio that would shake the
world. They were Ta'averen, outside the Pattern of the Wheel of Time,
twisting and bending its threads like spiderwebs in their palms.

  Thus the story of the coming of the Dragon Reborn started - a man so
strong in the One Power as to rival the Dragon (Lews Therin Telamon), a
man so strongly Ta'averen that nations would bend around his will. In the
late third Age, the seven seals which held the Dark One were weakening
and the spread of the Shadow was reaching further and further down from
Shayol Ghul - the weather was hotter than previous years, the agents
of the Dark One spread throughout the Land, False Dragons wrecked havoc
in many nations...
  The Dragon had sealed the Dark One into the Bore at Shayol Ghul, where
he was bound with thirteen Forsaken - the most powerful Aes Sedai from
the Age of Legends. The Dragon had also been blamed for Breaking the
World with the use of tainted Saidin. The legend of the Dragon Reborn
was regarded with the same apprehension and fear - but without the
Dragon Reborn, the world would fall into Shadow when the Dark One stirred.

FURNITURE

There are furniture objects on Fang , which you can use code-wise
inside the game. Some furniture objects you can sit on , some you 
can sleep on and some you can put things on.

The following commands are used with furniture :

sit/rest/sleep <furniture object> (as in "sleep bed")
put <object> <furniture object> (as in "put bread table")
get/take <object> <furniture object> (as in "get glass table")
look <furniture object> (as in "look table")

Use the "look <object>" command with furniture when you spot the
[+] sign after an object description , which means there are things
on/in it.

For example , if you see the next object description : 
"There's a long table here. [+]" , it means that there are things
on the table , and you need to use "look table" to see what's on it.

            Gai'shain wear only a white robe. It is an Aiel custom to
            never wear rings, as they may hinder fighting or other tasks.

\c06o\c07Altara\c00   - capital is Ebou Dar. People are of medium stature, of
            rather dark complexion. Women wear their hair loose, and
            down to their shoulders or shorter. Pale skirts with
            brightly colored petticoats showing on one side, with lace
            trim are worn by the women. Men have handle-bar mustaches
            and square trimmed beards, and wear dark pants, pleated
            white shirts with loose sleeves and brightly embroidered
            vests. Both sexes wear daggers on themselves and know how
            to defend themselves well. Women of all classes wear a

            region to region, with some towns having stripes as a local
            fashion and others scarves worn on the head. Many towns
            regard the braiding of hair as a sign of womanhood,
            especially the regions near the Mountains of the Mist.

\c06o\c07Arad Doman\c00 - capital is Bandar Eban. Women are tall, willowy, and 
have
            copper skin. (We assume the men do too :P) Men have long

            and sometimes have hair reaching below their shoulders.
            Domani dresses are thin, high necked and long, and are

            topknot. Men in Arafel have bells in their braided hair.
            Women are as rugged as the men, with the Saldaean women
            being distinctive from the other Borderlanders. Women in
            Saldaea have dark complexions, with exotic eyes and high
            checkbones.

 seals on
            them. Coats are closed with a double row of wooden buttons.

            in Book 8.

\c06o\c07Illian\c00   - capital is Illian. Illianers are rather short of
 stature,
            and stocky. Some men have grey eyes, and have beards with
            no mustaches. Women wear wide hats with scarves to tie them
            with. Men wear coats to their knees, and women wear rather

            loose women and a multitude of inns, Murandy has women
            who also wear their hair loose and their skirt hems a foot
            short of the ground, sometimes baring ankle.

\c06o\c07Ogier\c00    - The Ogier race is very old, and both sexes are very
 large
            and peaceful creatures. Younger Ogier males have less facial
            hair, and older ones have mustaches and beards. Female Ogier
            are shorter, with smaller eyebrows than the male and more
            delicate features. Both also have pointed furry ears that
            often respond to their emotions. Men wear coats that button
            to the neck, and flare at the knees. Women wear dresses
            and cloaks decorated with embroidered flowers, the more
            embroidery, the higher the rank or age.

\c06o\c07Saldaea\c00  - capital is Maradon. Saldaeans, unlike other
 Borderlanders,
            have dark, tilted eyes and bold noses. The Saldaeans are

            them. A few Saldaeans have red hair and green eyes. Men
            often wear beards or thick mustaches. Riding dresses are
            worn by women, made of plain dark material, with wide

            suited for riding.

\c06o\c07Seanchan\c00 - capital is Seandar. Seanchan have distinctive battle
 armor,
            which looks insectile and painted and guilded. Their

            shaved and the other half braided. Lower servants only

            with marks of their clan. Both genders wear gold or silver
            necklaces, and earrings that determine their rank. Tattoos
            are also found on their hands. Sailors go bare-footed and
            bare-chested; men are clean shaven. Both genders wear baggy,
            dark oiled breeches, held up by colorful sashes, and women
            wear loose colorful blouses near the shore. Nose rings are
            common for women, and higher ranking women have a chain
            which links a nose ring to an earring.

\c06o\c07Shienar\c00  - capital is Fal Dara. Some Shienarans have very pale
 hair
            and eyes. Fighting men shave their heads, leaving only
            a topknot that is tied back with a thong. Men wear high
            collared coats, and shirts with billowy sleeves. Widows
            wear black.

\c06o\c07Tarabon\c00  - capital is Tanchico. Taraboners often have a
 combination of
            dark eyes and light hair. Men have mustaches, and women have
            their hair in many little braids, sometimes inset with
            beads. Women are said to have pouty lips. Men wear baggy
            breeches, blouse-style tops, with embroidery on the legs and
            chest. Men also sometimes wear round hats, and always cover
            their mustaches by transparent veils. Men wear cylindrical
            caps, and coats embroidered with scrolls at the shoulders.
            Both sexes and Taraboners of all classes wear the transparent
            veil under their noses. Women's clothing is also embroidered
            at the chest, and is close fitting with a triple row of
            buttons up the back and a tight bodice. Women's dresses have
            lace trimmed necks up to their chins.

\c06o\c07Tear\c00     - capital is Tear. Tairens are dark-skinned, and dark
 eyes,
            with very few possessing blue eyes. They are of average
            height, taller than the Cairhienan, and have thick builds.
            Men wear coats and tight breeches, the upper class wearing
            puffy sleeved, striped coats, and wear bright colors. The
            High lords wear silver worked boots, and young lords oil
            their beards and trim them to a point. Lords wear ruffed
            collars and peaked hats. Women wear long dresses, and often
            have thick curls down the side of their heads. Some women
            wear their hair braided and coiled about their heads. Noble-
            women wear bright gowns with lace ruffs, and close fitting
            caps sewn with pearls or gems. Tairen widows wear white.
            People often wear wooden raised clogs over their shoes,
            since Tear is often muddy.

CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS
                    C  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

SLICEWEAVE "SLICE WEAVE"

This is not a weave, as the name might indicate, but a skill.
If you have this skill, you can set up a guard against any unwanted
weaves woven against you. To toggle this, type "noslice".
Whether you actually succeed in slicing the incoming weave depends
mostly on how strong you are in Fire and Spirit as compared to the
weaver's Spirit and Fire.

Beware, though; every time you automatically attempt to slice a weave,
you pay half the attacking weaves mana. You can't burn yourself out this
way, however; the weave simply bypasses the defences you've put up if your
mana is too low. Sliceweave tries to slice through -all- weaves woven by
someone else aimed at you, be they aggressive or beneficial.

GUILDEQ GEQ

The following rules govern the creation of guild equipment on Dragon's Fang:

&g1.&n You must first read and be conversant with the stated builder policy, 
listed under '&rpolicy building&n'.

&g2.&n The Head Builder must be notified of any changes made to existing geq,
and the creation of new geq, BEFORE such changes are made.  The Head GL should
also be made aware of the creation of new geq, though the final say on 
specific stats remains the prerogative of the HB.

&g3.&n The rules for stats are as follows; these may be altered by the Head 
Builder as deemed appropriate:

	&Ra.&n You have a total of &y1500&n points with which to buy stats for
each set of geq.  No player may have more than 1500 points of geq in his or
her possession at any time.

	&Rb.&n Each point of AC costs &y1&n point (max: &c200&n).
	&Rc.&n Each point of hitroll/damroll costs &y10&n points per PAIR (max: &c50/50&n).
	&Rd.&n Each +stat costs &y10&n points (max of &c4&n per stat).
	&Re.&n Each bonus hit point costs &y1&n point (max: &c300&n).
	&Rf.&n Each point of ABS costs &y2&n (max: &c200&n).
	&Rg.&n Each point of bonus mana or movement costs &y1&n point (max: &c500&n for
	   each).
	&Rh.&n Angreal prices are &y10&n points per 1% (max: &c50%&n).
	&Ri.&n Weapon costs depend on the damage dice used.  The following
	   are permissible:
		each 1d6 = &y20&n points (max: &c15&n)
		each 1d8 = &y25&n points (max: &c12&n)
		each 1d10 = &y30&n points (max: &c10&n)
	&Rj.&n Each extra attack costs &y200&n points (max: &c3&n)>
	&Rk.&n Special eq, such as autohide Warder cloaks, have a base cost
	   of &y100&n points, before added stats.
	&Rl.&n Permanent lights are free; containers are also free, but should 
	   have capacities no greater than 10000.
	&Rm.&n Players are limited to no more than 1 container and 1 angreal.
	   The SA'ANGREAL flag may not be set.
	&Rn.&n All geq should be flagged as !SELL, !DROP, and !BREAK.  It is
	   at the discretion of individual GL's to determine if the !TOOL
	   flag should be set.
	&Ro.&n You may not create eq that impacts negatively on one or more
	   stats, such as eq that gives -5 str.    
	&Rp.&n No item may have fewer than 200, or more than 500 points on it
	   for any reason.  Also, you must give out at least 4 pieces of 
	   geq.

Try to keep eq realistic: if you guildweapon is a dagger, then it probably
should not be D_WIELD.  Similarly, descing finger eq to be a pair of pants
is cause for reconsideration.

&gExample:&n Joe the GL creates a set of geq that gives 3 xattacks, 50/50,
and has a 10d6 weapon.  He needs to spend 3*200 + 10*50 + 10*20 = 600 + 500 +
200 = 1300 points.  He now has 200 points left over to spend as he wishes,
keeping in mind the maxes listed above.  Left over points are wasted, so you
are advised to use all 1500.
#200
ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and

#200
Multi

Usage: multi

Multi searches through the userlist for IPs that match and reports them,
enabling you to find multiplayers.
#200
BUGCHECK

Usage: bugcheck [-f|<zone number>]

This little command does the following:
Goes through all the objects in the mud and looks for those that have
excessive stats, "unfinished" in their descriptions or simply lack
descriptions.
Goes through all the rooms in the mud and checks whether they have exits
leading back to the same room (recursive exits), exits leading nowhere,
or no exits, and also whether the room descriptions contain the word
"unfinished".

If you type -f as argument, a detailed list of all errors is saved to 
file, if you type a zone vnum as argument, it gives a short list of 
what's wrong in that zone. You cannot combine -f and zone number.

all intact. It does not clone contents, though.

see you.

interpreter.

BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

#200
ECHO GECHO QECHO SEND

Usage: echo <message>
       gecho <message>
       send <victim> <message>
       qecho <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
QECHO displays the string to everyone with the QUEST flag.
SEND displays the string to a particular person.

C-style line breaks can be used to create paragraphs in GECHO.
Just use the \n between two sentences. You can also use \t for tabs.

ie: gecho Du gamla du fria,\ndu fjallhoga nord.\nOsv, i all oandlighet.

Yields:
Du gamla du fria,
du fjallhoga nord.
Osv, i all oandlighet.

Other Examples:

  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.

#200
FORCE

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
#200
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET -> FROZEN
#200
GOTO TRANS TELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001

NEWFORM

       applicable to non-sword forms. Everything is a form,
       either RJ-type for sword wielders, or more descriptive
       for other weapons i.e "a vertical thrust at the shoulder" .

1.1: Basic one-on-one fight.
     ----------------------
      If we can agree that the best forms are the more complex ones
(i.e. a form may cause great damage, but it takes a while to execute
it, prepare it, etc), then we go back to the Form's Speed factor.
Each of those can be a number from 0 to 1 - the smaller the number,
the slower the form.
      When a form is used, set its counter to 0, as Stefan suggested.
      The -rest- of the forms only get their priority counters
increased if a check is made according to its speed (that also
represents its complexity factor) - an actual IC thing!
      I.e. in the Second Round above, say that:
              River has been set to 0, since it was just used.
              Mountain has a Speed Factor 0.32 (it's pretty good)
              Parry has a Speed Factor of 1 - it's the basic one, it
                      sucks. :) but it's damn fast in preparing.
              So, Parry's Priority Counter  gets a chance of 1 to get
increased (always does) while Mountain only has a 0.32 chance to
be increased, so it gets upgraded one round in three.

      So, let's say Kane is a wise-ass. He knows Mountain is pretty
good, and wants to use just that.
      He's in trouble. :) Its counter will only upgrade one every three
rounds, and then it will be probably not be chosen that round either
since Parry will have a counter of 3 by then (well, on average).
      .. And if Kane is lucky, well, he can get to see his Great Form
used 2-3 times in a row.. it's just highly unlikely. :)
      Another form, not as good as Mountain could have a Priority
Counter of 0.9 for example.. etc. So it will be used pretty often,
almost as much as any other - and Parry won't really be used TOO
often :) With say, 10 forms to choose from, even if Parry's individual
chances of being picked up are highest than any other single form's,
it's going to be more likely that one of the others is picked. And it will
be set to 0 when it's used once, anyway.
      I think this one is it, unless you guys can break it somehow. :)
And good thing is, we don't even need any other rotations after
it (re-using forms from fastest-to-slowest, etc) since it's all integral
here.
      Having a form's percentage higher (or maybe having skills
like Blademastery) could possibly add something to the chances of
a form's Priority Counter being increased.
      Of course, experimentation will tell us what the numbers
we should be using here should be. But I think it works.

1.2: Addition: Specific body parts attacked/defended.
     --------
	Kane has three forms: River, Mountain, and Parry.

River has
	a SF of 0.5 (pretty good)
	StartPos/EndPos: Crouching/Crouching.
Mountain has
	a SF of 0.25 (pretty damn good)
	StartPos/EndPos: Standing/Standing
Parry has
	a FS of 1
	StartPos/EndPos: Standing/Standing

	Stefan has three forms: Whack, Smack, and Slash.

Whack has
	a SF of 0.5
	StartPos/EndPos: Standing/Kneeling (i.e. attacks legs)
Smack has
	a SF of 0.25
	StartPos/EndPos: Crouching/Standing (i.e. attacks body)
Slash has
	a SF of 1
	StartPos/EndPos: Standing/Standing (i.e. attacks body)

QUESTION: Do we fix it so that for the basic forms StartPos
and EndPos doesn't matter, i.e. they are always eligible? I let it
stand that they are Standing/Standing in this example, but I made
the code allow them to start at any position. Why? Check
round 2; only one form is eligible there normally, simply because
Slash isn't a Crouching StartPos form. But there are Crouching
Slashes, ICly.

(both people are standing when combat begins)
(Stefan always wins initiative)
FIRST ROUND :
	All have a priority of 0 at first.
	Each form is at priority 0, no form at more than that,
so they can all be picked.

(Sorilea's idea):
	The code looks for a form for Stefan and Kane: A list is
created with all forms having a Standing StartPos.
	Whack and Slash fit. Whack is chosen for Stefan (50% chance).
	Mountain and Parry fit. Mountain is chosen for Kane (50% chance).

	Whack attacks legs; Mountain defends body; Stefan has
a better than normal chance of succeeding because of this.
	(NOTE: Stefan, can you add form vs form to the list of factors
affecting a successful blow?)

	Parry and Slash's PCs are incremented. (at 1)
	Smack's 0.5 PC is incremented. (at 1)
	River's 0.5 PC isn't incremented. (at 0)
	Whack and Mountain's PCs  are set to zero anyway.

(Kane is standing; Stefan is Crouching)
SECOND ROUND:
	The code looks for a form for Stefan and Kane: A list is
created: the attacker's stuff are always chosen first. (in the last
round, it was the first round, so it was easier since everyone was
standing).
	We are looking for a form for Stefan, StartPos Crouching.
Making a list:
	Smack and Slash are eligible. Slash is chosen.
We are looking for a form for Kane, StartPos Standing.
Making a list:	
	Parry is eligible. Actually, it's the only form with a PC
over 1, so it would be chosen anyway.
	
	Slash attacks body; Parry defends body; 	no penalties
due to different defending positions.
	
	Slash, Parry's PCs are set to 0.
	Smack (with FS of 0.5) is actually incremented again : 2
	River (with FS of 0.5) is incremented this time: 1
	Mountain at 0.25 and Whack at 0.5's PCs aren't incremented.

2.0 Group fighting.
    --------------
        Forms combat, no one guy is the tank.
	Now, there is one requirement so far from Sori; to try and
have it as little tank-based (only one person gets attacked in each
group at a time) as possible.
	There are a few ways to handle this: I will give two.

2.1 Formations.
	Easily the best of all I've seen, but it was
be a b*tch to come up with, so bear with me. Now, this is derived from
Medievia, by yours truly. It's taking me a while to think, and correct me
if I leave anything out. It's different in some ways.
	Each person in a group has a place in a formation. The further
one is behind another person, the less likely he is to be hit. There are
three "slots" in each row.
	
	The first "line" (i.e. people who aren't covered by someone
in front of them) get chosen to be attacked 50% of the time. The
second "line" (people with just one person in front of them in the
formation) gets attacked 30% of the time, and the last line (the
ones with two people in front of them in the formation) get
hit 20% of the time. (you know, when the formation temporarily
breaks under an assault, or during the chaos of combat and
someone gets through , people protected still end up being attacked)
	Notice that if you are just standing in the third row of the
formation without someone in front of you, it's the same thing
as standing in the front, i.e. you are considered to be in a row
depending on how many people there are in front of you.
	The formula is (line percentage) * (persons in the row) / 3
to calculate anyone's chances of being damaged.

(	There is a command (in Medievia's case groupform) that
brings up something like this:

|    Kane         Stefan         3   |
|    Narsil        Fredrik        6   |
|    Kirene                8         9   |

	
for easier access and tactics. The tactics of this, by the way, are
excellent - think group weaves, where the impact of a fireball
is less as the distance increases from the front.
	You get in an empty slot simply by typing gset 8 (for example)
to be in the third row, second slot.)
	And, as we say, this is -it-. In every round, there simply
-is- no initiative common for all the group like in the other
systems (where someone is the tank, one group wins initiative
and attacks, the other defends).
	Initiative is first calculated for everyone in the combat.
	The fastest person picks opponent according to the percentages
above (yes, so two can end up attacking one person! you may
notice the percentages don't end up to 100%, and why should they?)
like this:
	First, the row attacked will be chosen. 50% for the first,
30% for the second, 20% for the third. Empty rows aren't considered,
only ones with someone in them.
	Remember that a row is defined by how many people are
standing in front of you, the visual example of groupform above is
just that - a visual.
	Then, the person in that row is chosen depending on the
number of people in it. For example, each person in the second
row above has a 50% chance of being attacked. Kirene, being alone
in the third row, has an 100% chance if her 20% row is chosen to be
attacked.
	The person who is chosen this way has automatically lost
initiative. And we continue going down the number of people in the
group until everyone has an opponent. Yes, it is possible for player A
to have rolled a better initiative than player B, and still be defending
while player B is free to attack - if he was attacked by someone yet
faster than him, player C. - he was "intercepted" although he
was faster than the other guy - combat in large numbers is like that.
	I think this covers everything. Encourages tactics, there is no
one tank, it is -very- simple to use by a player (it is just one command,
gset <slot>, and one to see the group formation with groupform),
it encourages tactics although doesn't -force- it (people will never have
to type either command; if they are ungrouped they are in the first
row anyway, and if they don't use it while grouping, well, then they
are unorganized and that's bad, but that's pretty realistic.
	It handles individual combat like group combat with one person
in each group. It does limit groups to nine people maximum, but ermm. :)
Plus we can increase it easily, I just don't think it's necessary.
	Well, there it is. The beauty of it is that it's pretty easy to code,
I think. The algorithm for choosing an opponent is included in this
example, and all it really needs is a 3x3 array for each group to keep
the positions. Or maybe the other way around, an unsigned int for each
player showing his place in a group. Anyway, you get the drift.

2.2 Individual initiative.
        This is the cop-out. Forms combat, no one guy is the tank.
	Everything is the same as before, initiative is rolled at the
beginning of combat. A list is created like before, from fastest to slowest.
	The fastest person choses one person at random from the other
group, that person automatically loses initiative. You can indeed end
up attacking someone who's already under attack.

2.3 Comments/comparisons between schemes:
	Scheme 2.2 is straight forward. Yet we'd have to keep commands like
rescue,etc that are just futile in the last scheme, and we can't do an "impact"
of a weave that'd look really cool (with more damage from an area
weave to the front rows and less to the back) as with 2.1. Plus, you could
do some -great- Band guildskills with formations. :) But on the other hand
this is a lot simpler.
#200
GSET

Enter choice : 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Here is a description of the function of each entry:

1. &ySex&n: Self-explanatory, but do not fail to set.  Neutral gendered 
        Aes Sedai and female Asha'man look rather strange.
2. &yAlias&n: The list of keywords that denote the mob, separated by spaces.  
          To look at the mob, for example, you would type 'look <keyword>'.
3. &yS-Desc&n: This is the name you see when communicating or fighting with 
           the mob.  Example: <S-Desc> scratches you.  Keep as brief, but
           as descriptive, as possible.
4. &yL-Desc&n: What the player sees when looking at the mob.  You should
           include some sort of description as to what the mob is doing. For
           example, "<name of mob> is sitting on a stool, sharpening a wicked
           looking knife."
5. &yD-Desc&n: This is the description a player sees when looking at the mob,
           similar to the description of a player character.  Do not ignore
           this entry, even if you do not wish to be overly verbose, as the
           default entry is "It looks, err, unfinished."
6. &yLevel&n : The level of the mob.  Set between 1 and 199.
7. &yAlignment&n: This field is no longer used.  Do not set.
8. &yHitroll&n: How much the mob's chance of hitting its opponent increases. 
            Each point of hitroll increases this chance by 1%.
9. &yDamroll&n: The amount of extra damage the mob does per successful hit.
A. &yNumDamDice&n: Amount of dice worth of damage the mob does per hit.
B. &ySizeDamDice&n: Size of the dice of damage the mob does.  Together with 
                fields A and 9, this determines the total amount of damage
                the mob does with every hit.  For example, the mob might do
                10d12+15 damage, where 10 is NumDamDice, 12 is SizeDamDice,
                and 15 is the damroll.  This would correspond to 25-135 
                points of damage per hit.
C. &yNumHPDice&n: Amount of hit point dice the mob has.
D. &ySizeHPDice&n: The size of the hit point dice the mob has.
E. &yHP Bonus&n: How many extra hit points the mob has.  This works with 
             fields C and D to determine the total number of hit points the
             mob has, analogous to the damage calculation.  Hence, a mob might
             have 10d50+100 hit points, with 10 the NumHPDice, 50 the 
             SizeHPDice, and 100 the HP Bonus, for a total of 150-600 HP.
F. &yArmor Class&n: The armor class of the mob.  The lower it is, the harder
                it is to hit.
G. &yExp&n: How much experience an equally levelled character gets for killing
        the mob.
H. &yMoney&n: The number of coins the mob carries.
I. &yPosition&n: The position the mob gets loaded into the game with (e.g.,
             sitting or standing).
J. &yDefault&n: The position the mob goes to after zone resetting.
K. &yAttack&n: The type of message the mob's attacks give, such as hit or stab.
L. &yNPC flags&n: A list of specifications the mob's characteristics, defined
              as follows.

        &gAGGR&n: The mob attacks any visible player in the room without
              provocation.
        &gSTAY-ZONE&n: The mob can move from room to room, but will not leave
                   the zone to which it was loaded.
        &gWIMPY&n: The mob flees combat when its hitpoints drop below 25%.
        &gMOUNT&n: The mob can be used as a horse.  Currently not supported.
        &gUNUSED&n: Do not set.
        &gTRACKER&n: The mob will hunt down any player that flees from a fight
                 with it.
        &gMEMORY&n: The mob remembers players that attacked it and fled, and
                will attack them on sight.
        &gHELPER&n: The mob assists any mob that is being attacked by a
                player in the same room.

        &gSHADOWSPAWN&n: The mob is Shadowspawn.  See HUMAN.
        &gCHANNELER&n: The mob can channel.  See HUMAN.

M. &yAFF Flags&n: The flags that determine what the mob is affected by.  A
              description of each follows.

        &gBLIND&n: The mob is blind.
        &gINVIS&n: The mob is invisible to normal sight.
        &gUNUSED&n: Do not set.
        &gSUFFOCATING&n: The mob is drowning/choking.  Normally not set.
        &gDET_INVIS&n: The mob can see invisible characters.

                stun.
O. &yMob programs&n: See the helpfile 'mobprogs'.
Q. &yQuit&n: This option exits the medit editor.  You will be asked if you
want to save changes to the mob.  If you select no, then your changes are

MOBPROGS MOBPROGRAMS MOB
Mob programs are simple scripts that can be written, using a menu driven
olc system, to allow mobs greater functionality and interaction with their 
environment.  Selecting option O in the medit menu brings up the following
screen:

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
&gMain term:     
 -----Sideterms-----&n
   <none>

&g -----Actions----- &n
   &R<none>&n
(&yD&n)elete (&yE&n)xit (&yM&n)ainterms (&yS&n)ideterms (&yA&n)ctions (&yN&n)ew 
Enter choice
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

&gD&n deletes the current mob program listed.
&gE&n exits the mob program menu and takes you back to the normal medit menu.
&gM&n changes/adds the mainterm of the trigger.
&gS&n changes/adds/removes the sideterms of the trigger.
&gA&n changes/adds/removes the actions to be run when the program is triggered.
&gN&n creates a new mob program.

Typing M, S, or A presents you with another menu, allowing you to pick whatever
conditions and actions you want met/performed.  Do not select actions until 
you have chosen a mainterm; if you do, the actions will be deleted when a
mainterm is selected.  Note that you may place more than one mob program on
a single mob, though the maximum is 30.

If you wish the mob to emote certain actions, the following variables may
be used in the expression:

        &y$N&n: the name of the target
        &y$n&n: the name of the mob
        &y$E|$e&n: he/she/it (target|mob)
        &y&S|$s&n: his/hers/its (target|mob)
        &y$M|$m&n: him/her/it (target|mob)

For example, typing "$n grins at $N and motions to $M" would emote
"<mob name> grins at <playername> and motions to him" (assuming the player
is male).  
#200
MUTE

Usage: mute <victim>

MUTE is used to shut a player up.  When muted, a player will not be able to
use most communication channels until he/she is unmuted.

See also: FLAGS

NOHASSLE HASSLE

Usage: nohassle

Toggles a flag to prevent aggressive monsters from attacking.
#200
NOTITLE

Usage: notitle <vicitim>

Prevent players from being able to set their own titles; i.e., if the
player consistently has an offensive title.  The definition of offensive
is left as an exercise for the reader.

6. &yExtra flags&n: This is a list of additional specifications that can be
                made.  Unlike the Type entry, more than one of these flags
                can be on a single item.

        &gANGREAL&n: Item gives extra mana to the wearer, generally 
                 expressed as a percentage.

               the game.
        &gUNDEFINED&n: Do not set.

More than one may be selected, but keep them realistic.  For example, 
no boots being worn on hands.
8. &yWeight&n: How much the item weighs.  Presently this does not do much,
but it should be set anyway for the day when encumbrance is coded to mean 
something.
9. &yCost&n: The coin value of the item.  This should always be greater
than zero.
A. &yCost in QP&n: The item's value in quest points.  This should only be set
if the item is a quest item.
B. &yTimer&n: How many mud hours before the item disappears.  Generally, this
is not set.
D. &yValues&n: Additional information that depends on the object type.  Always
set when appropriate.  Example: you may set the capacity of a CONTAINER here.
E. &yApplies menu&n: This is where you set the bonus/penalties an item gives
when worn/wielded, if any.
F. &yExtra descriptions menu&n: This is where you add any additional 
descriptions you want a player to see when looking at an item.  The extra
descs can all have different keywords.  For example, this is where you may 
wish to describe what the hilt of a sword looks like, or even a gem set into
the pommel.
Q. &yQuit&n: This exits the object editor. After quitting, you will be asked 
if you want your changes to be saved.  If you select no, nothing happens to 
the object.  If you select yes, the changes will only be saved until the next 
crash or reboot.  You must use 'oedit save' to save the item permanently.
#200
PAGE

Usage: page <player | all> <message>

PAGE is used to send a message, along with a beep, to another player.  Use
PAGE ALL to send a message and a beep to everyone in the game.

Examples:

  > page rasmussen Hey, are you still at the keyboard?
  > page all GAME WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN IN 10 MINUTES

Do not abuse this command.
#200
PARDON

Usage: pardon <victim>

Removes killer and thief flags from a player.
#200
POOFIN POOFOUT

Usage: poofin <message>
       poofout <message>

Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different
room.  POOFIN with no argument resets your poofin to the default "appears with
an ear-splitting bang"; POOFOUT with no argument defaults to "disappears in
a puff of smoke."

See also: GOTO
#200
PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

See also: DC
#200
RCOPY

Usage: rcopy [-flags>] <source room> <target room>

Makes a copy of <source room> in location <target room> (All rooms
are given as VNUMs. Without any  flags used, everything but extra
descriptions and exits are copied. With the flag -x rcopy will copy all
extra descriptions, given the -e flag. rcopy will copy all exits.  Given
-ex both extra descs and exits will be copied. 

Examples:

  > rcopy 32699 32697
  > rcopy -e 1 25000
  > rcopy -x 25000 9560
  > rcopy -ex 32500 71003

  background (/mud_dir/lib/text/background)
  credits    (/mud_dir/lib/text/credits)
  handbook   (/mud_dir/lib/text/handbook)

#200
RESTORE

Usage: restore <player | mobile>

RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit, mana, and movement points.
If used on immortals, it also sets all skill levels to 100%.
#200
RETURN

Usage: return

RETURN returns you to your regular body if you are switched into a mob.

See also: SWITCH
#200
RLINK

Usage: rlink <dir> <connect|disconnect> <1|2> [target]

Note: [target] is optional.  If excluded, a new room is created.

RLINK creates or removes an exit in the specified direction from the room
it is executed in.  The ending target is the room vnum to link the exit
to.

Using a 1 in the third field specifies a one-way exit, meaning the exit
is created/destroyed only in the room you are presently in.

A 2 specifies a two-way exit, which creates/deletes an opening in both
your present room and the one in the indicated direction.

Rlink is useful in that it is not necessary to redit exits in two rooms
separately; it does all the linking for you.

Example: rlink e connect 2 10001  <-- creates exit east to room 10001
         rlink nw connect 2  <-- creates a new room with next vnum in zone,
                                 and links with an exit northwest
         rlink s disconnect 2  <-- deletes exit to the south on both sides

SEE ALSO: REDIT
#200
ROOMFLAGS

Usage: roomflags

Toggles a flag which causes the virtual room number and room flags, if any,
to be displayed next to room names.
#200
SEDIT

Usage: sedit <vnum>
       sedit save <zone>

Edits an existing or creates a new shop in the database. This command makes
you enter a menu driven OLC system.
Note that you, to create a working shop also have to:
 * create the items you want the shop to sell
 * create the shopkeeper
 * make a room in which the shopkeeper will stand
 * with zedit, load the shopkeeper into the room and load the items
   which he will sell into his inventory.

The second alternative makes you save your changes onto disk.

See SEDIT2 for a decription of menu options.

#200
SEDIT2
 
Before using sedit, you must make sure you have a room for the shop, the
items you want the shop to sell, and a mob to serve as the shopkeeper.
When all that is said and done, you will see the following menu when
you type sedit.

Each entry is described below. 

0. &yKeeper&n: This is the vnum of the mobile that will serve as the 
           shopkeeper.  The name will appear automatically.
1. &yOpen 1&n: This is the first mud-hour that the shop opens.
2. &yClose 1&n: This is the first mud hour the shop closes.  Set to be larger
            than Open 1.
3. &yOpen 2&n: The second mud hour the shop opens, if any.  Set larger than 
           Close 1.
4. &yClose 2&n: The second closing time for the shop.  Set larger than 
            Open 2.
5. &ySell rate&n: This specifies the rate at which a shop sells an object,
              relative to its value.  Always set to 1 or more.  For example,
              a sell rate of 1.5 means the shop will set items at 50% above 
              the listed value for that object (which is set with OEDIT).
6. &yBuy rate&n: This specifies the rate at which the shop buys an object,
             relative to its value.  Always set to 1 or less.  For example,
             a buy rate of .75 means the shop only offers a player 75% of
             the object's value if he sells it to the shop.
7-D. &yMisc. messages&n: These are the strings the player will see for various
                     attempts to buy or sell items, depending on whether they
                     can afford it or not.  %d is the variable for the price.
E. &yNo Trade With&n: Unused.  This is a relic from circle stock code.
F. &yShop flags&n: Unused.
R. &yRooms menu&n: This option allows you to select what room(s) the shop
               exists in.  This must be set, but note that this does not make
               the shop work unless you have the shopkeeper mob in those
               rooms as well.
P. &yProducts menu&n: This allows you to select one items the shop has an
                  unlimited number of.  To make the shop actually sell them,
                  you must give them to the shopkeeper mob in zedit.
T. &yAccept Types Menu&n: This allows you to select what types of objects
                      the shop will buy.
Q. &yQuit&n: This exits the shop editor.  As per the other editors, you must
use 'sedit save <zone num>' to permanently save your changes.

Note that you must have created a room for the shop with redit, and a mobile
shopkeeper using medit.  Use zedit to place the shopkeeper in the room and
to load it with the items you wish it to sell.
#200
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHOW

Usage: show <mode> [argument]

Valid Modes:

death          errors         godrooms       houses

zones          room           obj            mob

The SHOW command displays information.  Some modes of show require additional
information, such as a player name.

   death: Shows all death traps in the game.
  errors: Shows errant rooms.
godrooms: Shows the rooms in the 'god zone'.
  houses: Shows the houses that are currently defined.
  player: Shows player summary information, simply provide a player name.

#200
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause | hotboot new.circle]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

HOTBOOT    Forces a re-read of new.circle, suspending action while in
           process.

HOTBOOT CHECK
           Makes a check as to whether everyone in the game are in a position
           to do a hotboot.
#200
SKILLSET

Usage: skillset <name> '<skill>' <value>

(128.123.222.111 etc).

See also: USERS
#200
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command;
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.

SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.

STAT

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat mobile red
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object thunderbolt

See also: VSTAT
#200
STRING

Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.
#200
SWITCH

Usage: switch <monster>

"TER'ANGREAL CRAFTING"

First of all: The item TYPE must be OTHER. 
Second      : It must be TAKE'able and HOLD'able. 
Third       : The extra flag TER'ANGREAL must be set (!MALE/!FEMALE might
	      also be used with ter'angreals. 
Fourth      : Edit the values of the Ter'angreal, they are in order of apperance:
		Spellnumber: The number of the spell this Ter'angreal will cast
		 when used. See \c01"HELP SPELL NUMBERS"\c00 for a list of weaves
		 and their number. 
		Casting lvl: At which level will this weave be cast, any 
		 number between 1 and 199 is OK. 
		Mana add: The extra mana this Ter'angreal'll put into the
		 weave for extra boost, anything between 0 and 12000 is ok. 

Exit oedit and save, you have now crafted yer first Ter'angreal. :>

Extra info:
  All flows in the casting will be set to exactly the requirements for the 
  weave, so the flow modifier will be 1. 

  All weaves (where appliable) will be tied. No maintining in other words. 

  Can be used by channies as well as non-channies. (At least until a 
  Channie-only flag is put in. :))

  All casting is done through the ordinary weave-function, arguments is just
  'passed along' from the use-cmd to the cast-cmd.

ZEDIT2

When you type zedit, the following screen is displayed.

-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-
Room number: &c10100&n             Room zone: &c100&n
&gZ&n) Zone name   : &yCaemlyn&n
&gL&n) Lifespan    : &y4 minutes&n
&gT&n) Top of zone : &y10500&n
&gR&n) Reset Mode  : &yNormal reset.&n
[Command list]
0 - <END OF LIST>
&gN&n) New command.
&gE&n) Edit a command.
&gD&n) Delete a command.
&gQ&n) Quit
Enter your choice : 
-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-

The various entries are explained below.

Z. &yZone name&n: This is the name of the zone, which is arbitrary, but
              should be accurate.
L. &yLifespan&n: This determines the time interval between which the zedit
             command list is executed again.  Set it to a low value if you 
             want the zone to reset often.  Generally, 30 minutes is a
             reasonable value.
T. &yTop of zone&n: This entry sets the highest room vnum in the present 
                zone.  This should only be set by the Head Builder.
N. &yNew Command&n: This option inserts a command into the command list.  The
                selection places you in a new menu that looks like this:
         -=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
         &gM&n) Load Mobile to room             &gO&n) Load Object to room
         &gE&n) Equip mobile with object        &gG&n) Give an object to a mobile
         &gP&n) Put object in another object    &gD&n) Open/Close/Lock a Door
         &gR&n) Remove an object from the room  &gL&n) Load mob on obj (sleeping)
         &gT&n) Load mob on obj (sitting)       &gU&n) Load obj ON obj
         What sort of command will this be? : 
         -=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The entries are self-explanatory.  If this is not the first command on this
list, you will be asked if it is dependent on the success of the previous
one.  If the command is an Equip, Put, or Give command, you should answer
yes.  You will then be asked a few questions depending on what options you
selected, such as the vnums of the mobiles or objects you wish to load.
Note also that the last three options are only used with furniture items.
E. &yEdit a command&n: Changes an existing command in the list.
D. &yDelete a command&n: Removes an existing command from the list.

NOTE: If you use zedit to open/close/lock a door, please remember to do
the same on both sides of the door.  If you delete a command, delete all
those that depend on it, if any, or replace it as appropriate.  

Q. &yQuit&n: This exits the zone editor.  Once again, you must use the 
command 'zedit save <zone num>' to permanently save your changes.
#200
ZRESET

Usage: zreset < zone | '*' | '.' >

Used to force a zone to reset.  '*' forces all zones to reset.  '.' forces
the zone you are in to reset.

#200
WAGON

A wagon is both a room and an object, and consequently must be created using
both the oedit and redit editors.  It is a room that can be entered using 
the 'enter' command as opposed to going through an exit, and generally
requires using the 'leave' command for egress.  As the name implies, a common
usage is to create wagon objects that can be pulled from room to room and
entered at will, but they do not have to be utilized for vehicular purposes.
Wagon objects can be used as entrances to other rooms, or even to other zones,
and they are often stationary, such as cave entrances.  In such a case, 
be sure to flag them as !PULL, otherwise, anyone can drag them around.

To create a wagon, you must create an object and a room that both have the
same vnum, and both must be flagged as wagon.  The object must not be
able to be picked up.
