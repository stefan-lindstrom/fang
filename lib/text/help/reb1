Rwarders
  The Rebel Warders are a group of elite warriors that fled the
White Tower in Tar Valon, center of Aes Sedai power, due to
circumstances, they felt were unjust and unlawful. The stilling
and rumored execution of Siuan Sanche, sent some of the Aes Sedai
in the White Tower, fleeing from the shining walls and as
faithful protectors of these powerful women, the Warders
accompanied their sworn charges in their flight. 
  Finding themselves in Salidar, the now Rebel Aes Sedai began to
consolidate their power, gathering more strength for their
eventual strike back at the White Tower and the perpetrator who
began the troubles between Aes Sedai, the false Amyrlin Seat,
Elaida. 
  The Warders have kept their skills well honed, continually
sweeping the forests around their Altaran strong hold, preventing
knowledge of their temporary seat of power, from spreading to Tar
Valon. 
  To assist in the retaking of the White Tower, this Rebel
organization has formed two other military machines, separate
from the elite Warders. The Rebel Watch and the Rebel Army, the
former led by the Blademaster and Warder Khorne, the latter by
former Captain General Gareth Bryne of the Queen's Armies in
Andor. These two new military forces will assist in the
dethroning of Elaida and the installation of who they feel, to
be the true Amyrlin Seat, Egwene. 

  To join the Rebel Warders, Watch, or Army,  you must fulfil the
following.

- Must not be capable of channeling.
- Must have a background mailed to Aeric and Alessio.
- Must be at least level 20.
- Must have a strong desire to roleplay.
- Must have five sponsors, two of which must be full Warders.
