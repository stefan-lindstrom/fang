SKIM SKIMMING
Very similar to Gating, this technique of travelling is slower
but it allows one to move from point A, to point B, without
having to know your starting point intimately. Fashioning a gate
that carries you into a void, you use a platform to carry you to
your destination, which takes moments or seconds, depending on
where you are travelling in the world. When you reach your
destination, another Gateway will open, allowing you to exit the
void, and appear at the intended target.

AES SEDAI

   3000 years ago when the Breaking of the World shattered the known
lands and scattered peoples, the channelers of that time, called 
Aes Sedai (the Servants of All in the Old Tongue) came to be
all that stood between success and failure for the light against
the Shadow. 
   In the act of freeing the lands from the Shadow's impending
domination, the male Aes Sedai received a crippling blow from the
Dark One to their abilities, every last one of them eventually driven
to madness through their very link to the source of their power;
thus when we speak of Aes Sedai since we refer to women who can
channel the female half of the True Source, from which the Aes Sedai's
power is drawn in the form of the One Power. This can be a fearsome weapon
in their hands, though the strength of the abilities varies from 
one person to the other.
  The title of the Aes Sedai is bestowed by either the Rebel
Tower, a group who felt that the White Tower's policies were
unjust, and by the White Tower, who has trained women to channel
for generations. 
  Blamed for the Breaking of the World despite what they did to
stop the Shadow, they are not trusted by the general population
and yet few rulers go without an Aes Sedai advisor. Their
knowledge is unparalleled but for what use they put that
knowledge is unclear to all but their own kind.

ENHANCE
  Seeking to improve their importance and prestige across the
lands, Craftsmen managed to develop a method of improving the
armor of a warrior. Using a technique known only to themselves,
they return pieces of armor to the customer improved many times
over.
  Beware that some metals or special substances of which armor is
made, cannot be improved by these skilled smiths.

WOLFNAME

   The wolfkin refer to each other not by their human names, but
with a name chosen that is special to each.
   You can only choose that name once in a lifetime; if it needs
to be changed for some reason, only an Immortal can set that for
you, so choose it carefully!
   Before his name among the wolfkin has been chosen, that person's
projected thoughts and emotions will be barely more than whispers
in the night - sooner or later he has to lay claim to a name.
   The command is "\c03wolfname <name>\c00".

#
TOOL
  In times past, there have been periods when the great smiths of
the lands have not been sought out to perform their trade.
Seeking to find another method of drawing customers, the
Craftsmen drew together for a great council and
after that meeting was completed, many new inventions had been
made.
  Chiefly among these new ways of earning coin, was the skill
of Tooling. Using new alloies and other secrets known only by 
these smiths, they were able to change the appearence of almost
any object, save that most mysterious of alloies, Heartstone. 
  Finding someone to perform this task is rare but if you stumble
across a smith with talent,, prepare to hand over a fee for the
service.

get a list of all the characters seeking the guild along with 
the names of any sponsors they have.
   A seeker never sees who is sponsoring him or her; but in the
score sheet it is possible to see the number of sponsorships
they currently have.

CAEMLYN ANDOR DIRECTIONS LOST


Caemlyn was built to be as IC as possible, and while not all
of its descriptions are IC (yet), the layout is. Each gate is
in its proper place; there are 5 outer gates and two gates to
the Inner City. The Oval Plaze is at the foot of the Andoran
Royal Palace, and each road which is supposed to be in Caemlyn
according to the books thus far, is. 
 
This makes Caemlyn a wonderful place in which to roleplay.
It can also make Caemlyn extremely confusing. Anyone who has
ever studied the maps of Caemlyn from the Wheel of Time books
knows that Caemlyn is very oddly-shaped, with several distinct
"neighborhoods" of twisting, maze-ish streets. Thankfully,
here on Dragon's Fang, Caemlyn is scaled down to a reasonable
size. So, the streets are slightly less like mazes than they
appear to be in the books. But they are not all straight and
simple, and the helpfiles are designed to help anyone find
their way around the city.  
 
Each street in Caemlyn has its own helpfile. Study them as
you walk through Caemlyn. Each helpfile gives directions to
the oval plaza and describes where that street is in relation
to other streets. Here is a list of Caemlyn's streets, in
alphabetical order:
 
\c10Arrow Street
Bounty Crescent\c03**\c10
Counselor Boulevard\c03**\c10
Crown Boulevard\c03**\c10
East Gate Road**
Gate Roads\c03**\c00 (this entry describes all the gate roads and their
            relation to each other - "HELP GATEROADS")
\c10Ilyeras Street
Jadeflower Lane
Kenurae Street
Lion Avenue
Nerasis Road
North Gate Road\c03**\c10
Nyerin Lane
Oakseed Avenue
Palace Circle\c03**\c10
Park Circle
Protosa Lane
Queen's Circle\c03**\c10
Raesane Boulevard
Ryslede Street
Rose Avenue
Saiye Lane
Serafal Avenue
Silkfeather Lane
Slivera Boulevard
South Gate Road\c03**\c10
Tal'isani Road\c03**\c10
Twilight Arcade\c03**\c10
West Gate Road\c03**\c00
  
  
\c03**\c00 Note: this indicates a main road.
  
\c08When you use these helpfiles, do not type in the full
name of the road\c00. For example, type simply "\c14HELP RAESANE\c00"
rather than "Help Raesane Boulevard". 
 
In addition to these helpfiles, there are signs posted at
major intersections. Type look sign to read them. Also,
anyone wishing to have a map of Caemlyn may purchase one
at \c03The Hunted Horn Inn \c00in Illian, or e-mail Alishya at

KEYWORDS "KEY WORDS"

The old algorithm for finding rooms was kinda stupid. You could only send in 
one keyword at the time. With the new code, you can send in a list of 
keywords, where each keyword must be a substring of the rooms name, in 
order for a match to occur, for instance:

lia will match Illian, Liams, liandrin, etc...
Illian Sewer Entrance, will only match rooms which contain these three words
in it's title, or substrings of, for instance: 
The First Room of the Illian Sewer Entrance 

will match, as will:

The Second Sewer Entrance of Illian. 

Ordering of keywords doesn't matter. 
Numbers can still be used todenote orders, for instance.
2.Illian Road

Will match with the second room having Illian and Road as substrings of
it's name. 

To use this new feature with SPEEDWALK or CART, just supply your list of 
keywords, for instance:

cart Centre Caemlyn
speedwalk Caemly Pigeo Courier

To use it with Gate, supply your list enclosed in '', for instance:

weave 'gate' 'Chosen Gathering Area'

Gate will still work with the old syntax, as longas you only have one 
keyowrd, for instance:

weave 'gate' Caemlyn

     all the way to the other edge of the city, crossing \c07East Gate
     Road \c00at the \c02East Gate \c00itself. After it crosses the East Gate,
     it moves south and west until it spills into the northeast
     corner of \c07Palace Circle\c00. Along the way, it marks both ends of
     \c07Bounty Crescent\c00. \c07Crown Boulevard \c00ends at West Queen's Circle.
     \c07North Gate Road \c00bisects Queen's Circle. And it meets many
     smaller roads: \c07Kenurae Street \c00on the west side, \c07Jadeflower Lane\c00
     one room east of Kenurae St., \c07Ilyeras Street \c00just east of North
     Gate Road, \c07Lion Avenue \c00just southeast of Ilyeras St., \c07Nerasis
     Road \c00(a couple rooms away from East Gate Road), and \c07Tal'isani
     Road \c00(southeast side, near Palace Circle). \c07Rose Avenue \c00crosses
     East Queen's Circle twice near Lion Avenue and then ends on
     the southeast side of Queen's Circle. Overall, it may seem
     very confusing, but every side street leads to another larger
     street; just keep going and you'll find your way.

TRAINS PRACTICES

Trains are gained with levels. They can be used to gain skills and weaves at a 
skills trainer or to raise stats at a stats trainer.
Trainers can be found at various places throughout the MUD. However, the most
frequently used trainers are w, sw of the of the oval (skills) and w, 2nw, s
of the oval (stats).
Practices are also gained with each level and are used to practice skills and
weaves once they are gained. Trains and practices can be interchanged using
the tutor and achieve commands at the skills trainer.

HUNGER THIRST EAT DRINK NOHUNGER

If you stick around long enough you will get hungry and thirsty. Being hungry
causes your hit points, mana and movements to regenerate at a slower rate. To
alleviate this you need to eat and drink occasionally. In order to eat you 
must have a food item in your inventory and to drink you must either be in the 
same room as a fountain (fountain, stream, pool, etc.) or have a water 
container in your inventory. Food and water containers can be bought from the 
peddler in the oval. 
Hunger and thirst are not fatal, however, and for those of you who wish to
rid yourselves of those annoying messages there is a nohunger toggle. To
use it simply type nohunger


Usage: eat [food name]
        drink [container name/fountain name]
        nohunger

BUY LIST

Occasionally it is necessary for you to buy items. This is quite easy to do.
When in the same room as a shopkeeper mob, simply type list to see a list of
all the items for sale and their prices. Once you know what you wish to buy
you may proceed in many different ways.


usage: buy #3 (Buys the third item on the list)
       buy item_name (Buys the first item on the list with a specific name)
       buy 4.item_name (Buys the fourth item on the list with a specific 
       name)
       buy 3 item/item number (Buys 3 of the item. Much less spammy than 
       buying the item three times)

GAIN PRACTICE

You will doubtless wish to gain and practice skills and weaves during the
game. To do this you will need to be at a skills trainer, the most frequently
used of which can be found w, sw of the oval. While at the skills trainer you
may type gain to see a list of the skills and weaves that you are able to
gain. Once you decide on a skill you want, simply type gain skillname to gain
it. After you've gained it you will need to practice it. To do that type 
practice skillname. Typing practice at any time will show you a list of skills
that you have gained.

AC

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -20 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:


  \c03AC \c07 Roughly equivalent to\c00
-----------------------------------------------------------
  10  Naked person
   0  Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields")
 -20  Armored battle tank

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -200 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-20 to 10.)

ACRONYMS

        Here are some of the acronyms you are likely to encounter
during your stay in the Dragon's Fang.

\c02OOC:\c00    Out Of Character. Since Dragon's Fang is a Role Playing Mud,
        when you talk to someone you are supposed to be whoever your
        character is, unless you are OOC - in other words, when you
        are OOC it is you, the player sitting in front of the screen
        doing the talking and not the character you are playing.
\c03IC :\c00    In Character. Whenever you are not OOC, you are IC, which means
        that the character you are playing is doing the talking. This
        is the mode you will be assumed to be in, unless otherwise
        specified.
\c01RP :\c00    Role Playing. Whatever you do while you are IC is RPing. The
        Dragon's Fang is a role playing Mud, which means characters
        there like and interact as if they belonged to the fantasy world
        that the Mud uses as a setting.
\c07AFK:\c00    Away From Keyboard. An Internet term rather than a Mud one, this
        just means that when you are AFK you are no longer sitting in
        front of your computer, but are somewhere else at the time.
        Please let other people know you are AFK (in your title, or
        using the AFK command) so that they don't talk to you while you
        aren't there to respond.
\c06Newbie:\c00 Whoever is new to the lands of the Dragon's Fang. You will
        also be carrying the [Poor Newbie] title on the left of your names
        in the who list until you make it to the 5th level of experience.

#
A'DAM

  A device created by the Seanchan.  It is a ter'angreal:  a collar and
bracelet linked together by a leash, all of silver.  A woman who can be
taught to channel wear the bracelet and control the woman born with the
spark and wear the collar.  It creates a link between the two women.
When complete, the Sul'dam knows what the Damane is doing with the Power.
  The Damane cannot channel without the Sul'dam's permission or she will
get sick. The more Power she will draw without permission, the sicker
she will become.  Both women are aware of the other's feeling, like anger,
fear, sadness, sweetness, lie or truth...  The Sul'dam can make the Damane
feel things through the a'dam, like pain or pleasure. The Damane can not
touch any weapon, nor anything she think of as a weapon, or she will get
sick.  The Damane can not move the bracelet of the a'dam when no Sul'dam
wear it.  The farther she will try to move it, the sicker she will become,
until unconsciousness.  When a Damane and a Sul'dam are joined, whatever
the Sul'dam feels, the Damane feels twice over, even to death. This is why
a Damane may never strike at her Sul'dam, but she must protect her even
more than herself.
  If the leash of the a'dam gets broken when a Damane and a Sul'dam wear
the a'dam, they die. If a man touches the a'dam, both women suffer from
the touch.  If a man wears the a'dam, he goes crazy and most of the time,
both the woman and man die.  A'dams do not work on women that cannot
channel.

#
AFK NOAFK
  The \c06AFK\c00 flag (Away From Keyboard) is handy to use to show others
that you are not reachable. You can customise your AFK flag by typing :
   AFK <message>
For example, if my name is Nynaeve and I wish to be AFK, I can give a
reason for being AFK. I would just type:
\c01   AFK Nynaeve is AFK to thump someone with a stick.\c00
If you then telled Nynaeve while she was AFK, the following messaage
would be displayed:
     Nynaeve is AFK to thump someone with a stick.
     \c01You tell Nynaeve,"owww"\c00
AFK can be turned off by typing NOAFK.

#
AIEL
Pronounced (\c06eye-EEL\c00)
  The Aiel are the warrior-like people who inhabit the Aiel Waste, east
of the Spine of the World. They follow the code of Ji'e'toh - Honor and
Duty in the Old Tongue (See \c07HELP JI'E'TOH\c00).
  The Aiel are divided into twelve warrior societies (not all Aiel have
to be in a warrior society) and twelve clans (all Aiel have to belong to
a clan), so you should think about these things when you are considering
joining the Aiel.
  Aiel are the People of the Dragon, and as such, they have followed He
Who Comes with the Dawn (the Dragon Reborn) past the Spine of the World
and into the lands of the wetlanders (see \c07HELP WETLANDERS\c00).
  To be guilded you must fulfill these requirements:
   * Be level 20 or above.
   * Not be a male channeler.
   * Have a Clan chosen and a description set.
   * Have a history/story. The guilding process is IC and related to the
     idea that you were separated somehow from the Nation and are returning.
     Histories should have something to do with your being away.
   * One sponser from any Aiel already guilded.

AIELCLAN
  The Aiel are divided into twelve clans, almost all of which have accepted
Rand al'Thor as He Who Comes with the Dawn. These clans are:\c06
   Chareen
   Codarra
   Daryne
   Goshien
   Miogama
   Nakai
   Reyn
   Shaarad
   Shaido
   Shiande
   Taardad
   Tomanelle
\c00
  The \c01Shaido\c00 are the only clan that has not accepted Rand al'Thor
as He Who Comes with the Dawn, and they have rebelled, claiming their
own Clan Chief, Couladin, as He Who Comes with the Dawn. They have
attacked the rest of the Aiel, and discarded Ji'e'toh (see\c07 JI'E'TOH\c00).
For that they have been outcast, and those Aiel who succumb to the
Bleakness and run away to join the Shaido (see \c07HELP AIELRANKS\c00) are named
the \c05Mera'din.\c00

#
AIELSOCIETIES
  Most of the Aiel, but not all, join a warrior society. All of these
societies, except for the Maidens of the Spear, are exclusively male.
The \c06Maidens of the Spear\c00 have as their special mission the protection
of He Who Comes with the Dawn, and never marry, dedicating their lives
to the spear. The societies are:
  \c06Seia Doon\c00        - Black Eyes
  \c06Far Aldazar Din\c00  - Brothers of the Eagle
  \c06Rahien Sorei\c00     - Dawn Runners
  \c06Sovin Nai\c00        - Knife Hands
  \c06Far Dareis Mai\c00   - Maidens of the Spear
  \c06Hama N'dore\c00      - Mountain Dancers
  \c06Cor Darei\c00        - Night Spears
  \c06Aethan Dor\c00       - Red Shields
  \c06Shae'en M'Taal\c00   - Stone Dogs
  \c06Sha'mad Conde\c00    - Thunderwalkers
  \c06Tain Shari\c00       - True Bloods
  \c06Duadhe Mahdi'in\c00  - Water Seekers
The societies, as do all Aiel, follow the code of Ji'e'toh, and none
kill without raising their black veils.

AM ASHA'MAN

  \c07Asha'man(\c04AM\c00\c07):\c00

  (1)In the Old Tongue, "\c02Guardian\c00" or "\c02Defender\c00," with a strong
     implication that this is a defender of truth and justice.
  (2)The name given by Rand Al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, to those who
     wield the male half of the True Source (Saidin) in service to him.

  Asha'man come from all walks of life and geographic locations. Some
seek the amnesty, granted by Rand to men who can channel, and have
dreams of wielding great power. Others are there simply because, in
being tested, they exhibited power and now must learn to control it
or surely die.
  They are not only trained in the use of the One Power, but are also
drilled in using the sword as well as their hands and feet. Pushed
much harder than the women at the White Tower, AM are meant to be
weapons, plain and simple.
  The taint and a world that fears men who can channel keeps them
isolated at their training grounds (the Black Tower). From there they
recruit those like themselves and prepare for Tarmon Gai'don...the
Last Battle.

*Definitions were, partly, from aCoS(book7). For info on what the rest
of the world thinks of male channelers...

AMRANKS
  In the WoT books, Asha'man were of three ranks: Soldier, Dedicated
and Asha'man (assigned by Rand al'Thor). New recruits and the less
experienced were Soldier rank. Dedicated were experienced somewhat,
and received a pin on their collar. Asha'man rank was experienced
channelers and fighters who had considerable knowledge with using the
One Power as a weapon - they had two pins on their black coat collars.
The ranks for the guild are based on these ranks.
  The following are the ranks for the Asha'man (they should be self-
explanatory):
  Prisoner
  Recruit
  Soldier
  High Soldier
  Dedicated
  Asha'man
  Recruiter
  Instructor
  Elite Asha'man

AMRP

  This section provides the AM with a synopsis of what types of
roleplay and views of various other groups will be encouraged. First
and foremost, AM will be strong roleplayers. We will support this
with rewards for good play. Sometimes you might even be asked to add
something to your character's personality. We think this will help
average rpers become good ones, and good rpers become exceptional
ones. Maintaining multiple identities, as well as dealing with the
taint, can be a challenge, but that is why we are here is it not? Our
goal will be to do our part to develop intricate ways to create a WoT
atmosphere here on Fang that will rival the books:)

The AM view on other guilds: Remember...these are Asha'man...Men that
can move mountains. Opinions will vary in the beginning, but will grow
in this direction.

to be trusted. They seek to tear from us the gift which the Creator has
given. Fear of "madmen" drives them to hunt us. They are a threat to any
man who can channel, and wether Tower bound or serving the Dark One, they
are surely the Dragon's enemies.

   \c07Army of the Rebel Tower\c00: This army protects the Amyrlin
situated at the Rebel Aes Sedai encampment. Little is known of them, but
they side with the Aes Sedai, not to be trusted or approached.

   \c07Aiel:\c00 Strange people with even stranger customs. They fight
well with weapons or hands, but still they are only flesh. All clans but
one seem to strongly support Rand, but not as the Dragon Reborn, as the
Car'a'carn. Among them are women who can channel (some Wise Ones), but
they do not seem a threat to the Lord Dragon, or to us.

   \c07Band of the Red Hand:\c00 Followers of one of the Lord Dragon's
friends. Loyalty to the Lord Dragon may be suspect, but they seem to have
outrageous luck in battle when led by Matrim Cauthon. They are significant
only as soldiers on our side of the fight.

   \c07Children of the Light:\c00 Whitecloaks. Misguided ones who claim
to "walk in the Light." All channelers to them are darkfriends as is
anyone, including the Dragon Reborn, who is associated with them. Clearly
one of our enemies, but hardly our direct target. To be watched out for,
since in large groups they hold a lot of sway.

 \c07 Darkfriends:\c00 Pawns of the Dark One. Sneaky, deceptive, sworn
to the shadow. Some of them even wield the One Power. They are as acursed
as all other shadowspawn, even more so because they hide among us.

   \c07Dragonsworn:\c00 This band is less a formed unit than rabble that
are known for causing havoc near the Amadacian border. Little is known
of them, except that a prophet is held in awe by them. As this so called
prophet advocates the Lord Dragon, they are not considered hostile.
They are hardly dependable or even noteworthy. (This is NOT a guild).

   \c07Forsaken:\c00 Wait a while... Rand will kill them. Strong but divided.
Don't worry about fighting one by yourself, because you won't live long
enough to consider it a fight once you realize who you are dealing with.
-IF- you realize who you are dealing with by the time you are dead. They
certainly won't be dropping in to visit our "farm" though.

   \c07Gleeman:\c00 Entertainment, and they should hardly be attacked.
Regarded by the entire world with friendliness, they are neutral to our
cause. Some are reported to be rather sneaky.

   \c07The Kin:\c00 The entire world knows nothing of any Kin, and you
should act as if you do not either. The Kin are women channelers who have
been (somewhat) trained at the White Tower - hardly out allies, but weak
enough not to pose a threat.

   \c07Ogier\c00: These Builders are the stuff of legends, and are
peaceful, long-lived creatures of a different race. The seem neutral,
and one of the Lord Dragon's friends is reported to be an Ogier, albeit
a rather hasty one. Most Ogier do not leave their steddings, so they
are of little worry.

   \c07Sea Folk:\c00 Merchants who bring finely crafted work to our
shores. They seem to believe the Lord Dragon is their Coramoor. Their
women are purportedly beautiful too:) (This is NOT a guild).

   \c07Seanchan:\c00 Not much of these people is known, other than that
they were turned back in the battle at Falme. It is rumored that they
had strange creatures at their command and Aes Sedai on leashes.

   \c07Two Rivers People:\c00 They have long bows and follow Rand's
scraggly bearded friend Perrin Aybara. As long as they serve Perrin
and he serves the Lord Dragon, they are our allies.

   \c07Warders:\c00 Aes Sedai lapdogs. They are faithful, loyal,
obedient, and rather skilled with a sword. A weakness of the Aes Sedai
to have an easy path to pain so close at hand. Did I mention that they
are obedient?

ANGREAL SA'ANGREAL

  Angreals and Sa'angreals are items from the Age of Legends, with which
a channeler might use more of the One Power, than he/she could manage
unaided. A sa'angreal is more or less a 'beefed up' version of Angreals.
  The making of Angreals and San'greals have been lost since the Age of
Legends, along with most of those items as well.
  Some *greals will work only for men, others only for women, and
according to legends there might even be those who works as well both for
men as for women.
  *greals today are rare, and sought after by the Aes Sedai, who consider
ALL objects of the One Power to be rightful property of the White Tower,
so should you find one, keep it a secret, if you wish to keep it.
  As *greals works in the WoT-books, we have tried to make them similar
here on DF. This means, that a strong channeler will get much more
mana-increase, than a weak channeler. As example, we have the two
channelers Otto and Harald. Now, otto has mana at 300, while Harald is
very mighty with his 2000 mana.
  With the same Angreal, Otto might gain an 150 additional mana, while
Harald will gain an additional 1000. (Hope you see the pattern here ;))

WARDERS

   The Gaidin help files are divided in two parts:

Type  "\c01help twarder\c00" for help about the \c14White Tower\c00 Warders.
Type  "\c01help rwarder\c00" for help about the \c06Rebel Tower\c00 Warders.

#
TWARDERS

   The Warders belong to an elite group of fighters called the Gaidin,
in the Old Tongue meaning Brothers to Battle. Together with the Aes
Sedai, \c01bonded\c00 to them through a mystical process of the One
Power, they will die to protect their bondmate.
   Tradition had the Gaidin train their skills in the \c14White Tower\c00 in
Tar Valon. There in the yards the instructors would take young men who
came to be trained by them and teach the way of the sword to a great
extent - the result being the finest trained warriors anywhere. Lessons
will include the blade, but also alternative weapons, survival skills,
everything to assist the Warders in the lifetime of service to the Aes
Sedai against the Dark One, preparing for the Tarmon Gai'don, the Last
Battle.
   Recently, there was a coup in the White Tower; the Gaidin following
the breaking of the Tower were also split in two groups, a number of them
following the Rebel Aes Sedai to Salidar. The relation between them has
never been clear; indeed before the late events there hadn't been a
recorded incident of Warders fighting against Warders.
   A number of young noblemen trained by the Gaidin led by \c01Gawyn Trakand\c00,
the First Prince of the Sword of Andor has formed the \c01Younglings\c00; this
highly efficient division of the White Tower, still obedient and bound to
service to the Aes Sedai has often expressed its unwillingness to follow
orders by them, lacking trust for the Servants, but has yet to lose in
battle even when facing the Aiel - the combination of mounted combat
tactics and the Gaidin training making them all but invincible.
   The \c14Bond\c00 forged between a Warder and his Aes Sedai gives him
abilities beyond those of the normal man. He can take far greater amounts
of physical damage than a normal man and survive, his wounds heal a lot
faster, he can sense Shadowspawn and some servants of the Dark One from a
distance, and he can feel what his bondmate can at all times, along with
her exact location in relation to him.
   When a Warder's Aes Sedai dies, he feels the exact time, and manner of
her death. His will to live dies with him; most Warders will die avenging
their bondmate's deaths, or will seek out impossible odds even they can't
face and live. It is said the Warder is dead inside then.

#
ARMOUR

  No sane warrior goes to battle without some kind of protection. This
protection is symbolized as Armor Class (AC) and Absorbtion (Abs).
  AC determines whether you get hit or not, and you have 100 armour if
you're totally unprotected. The lower the AC, the better; you can have
as low an AC as -200, at which virtually none hits you.
  Absorbtion determines how much damage is taken by the armor before you
take damage yourself. You start with 0 Abs, and can get as high as 400.
This figure is the amount in -tenths of a point- damage, so if you have
100 Abs, your armor absorbs 10 points of damage.
There are also weaves available to channelers which enhance the AC and Abs.

"ARMY OF THE REBEL TOWER" AOTRT
  The Army of the Rebel Tower is led by General Gareth Bryne, once leader
of the Queen's Guards of Caemlyn. This army is rather scraggly, with many
men untrained and a few mercenaries. The army protects the Rebel Tower, and
namely the Amyrlin Seat Egwene al'Vere. The goal of the army is to reclaim
the White Tower for the rightful Amyrlin Seat, seeing as Elaida is an unfit
Amyrlin Seat, and Red to boot.

BAND BOTRH

  The Band of the Red Hand is an army group under the leadership of Matrim
Cauthon.  The Band was formed when Mat rescued a group of men during a
battle when they would have otherwise died.  Mat is now known for having
a superior handle on tactics and strategy, and this is one of the reasons
the Band formed to follow him.
  Another is Mat's astounding luck.  He has been known to win consistently
in dice and do many other things, all attributed to luck.  The Band belives
that it is Mat's luck that has brought them the success they have had.  To
this day, the Band has never lost a fight.
  The Band is made up of 4 units: Crossbowmen, Pikemen, Cavalry, and
Infantry. The Band's major strength is in teamwork (both in rp, and in
guild skills). The Band moves a lot, and quickly.  Mat has been known to
call a move on a whim and within a VERY short time, the camp is packed up
and ready to move. As the Band is made up of people from many different
nations, any race is welcome to enter the Band.  Likewise, either sex
may join.  However, since the Band is primarily an army, only those of
the Adventurer, Soldier, or Thief class may join.  You must also be at
least level 20 to join.
   A major portion of being a Band member is rp, therefore, you will need to
rp with one or more Band members before you will be admitted.  Please feel
free to talk to any, especially Mat, if you are interested or if you have
any other questions.

#
BANDGUILDS

Each person is their own character.  Based on your character's experience,
you should make decisions about how to treat members of the other guilds.
The following is a list of the other guilds on Dragon's Fang and the way
Band members might treat them if you are not sure about how YOU yourself
would.

\c07Aiel:\c00 They follow the Dragon Reborn, as does the Band.  Although Band members
      are more dedicated to Mat and the Band than to the Dragon Reborn, they
      are still on the same side.  Aiel are not your enemy (unless they are
      Shaido).  Band members from Shienar or Cairhien might distrust Aiel,
      but the rest of the Band would be indifferent to them.

\c07Army of the Rebel Tower:\c00 Led by Gareth Byrne, an experienced general
      and tactician, this could be a formidable army, if they had a few more
      legions on their side. At the moment, they form the protection for
      Egwene al'Vere, the newly proclaimed Rebel Amyrlin and childhood friend
      of Rand al'Thor. A hesitant ally at best.

\c07Asha'men: They are also on the same side, but they are male channelers.
      Along with that goes a great amount of mistrust.  Cooperate with them
      if need be, or you are told to, trust them only in dire straights,
      and stay away from them if possible (they could go mad at any moment.)

\c07Children of the Light:\c00 The Band is on the side of the Dragon, the Children
      are not.  This makes them natural enemies.  They are usually in large
      groups, so don't mess with them directly unless forced.  Any
      hinderance to their operations without them knowing who did it is
      encouraged.  ;)  Do not cooperate with them, and keep other Band
      members out of their clutches.

\c07Darkfriends:\c00 It will be difficult to tell who is a DF and who is not.  If
      you find one somehow, or suspect someone, get some Band members you
      trust to help you capture them and bring them to Mat.  Kill them only
      if they are about to do something nasty to someone.

\c07Forsaken:\c00 Finding a Darkfriend is hard, finding a Forsaken in infinitely
      harder.  They are masters of disguise.  You may have been told that
      they exist and are loose, but you may have some personal doubts about
      that.  If, by some ODD chance, you happen to discover a Forsaken, FLEE!
      This is not someone to take on alone or even in a small group.  Report
      what you saw/heard to Mat and he will get in touch with Rand.

\c07Gleeman:\c00 They are entertainers, and are most likely looking for a
      copper or two for one of their songs or tumbling acts. A good way for
      a hard working soldier to unwind. Harmless.

\c07The Kin:\c00 The existance of the Kin is unknown to everyone, except a
      very few Aes Sedai. However, these are women who can channel, but most
      are healers - a handy commodity for an army. Not to be attacked, for
      they can handle themselves with knives well and are powerful in their
      own right, aside from their use of the One Power.

\c07Ogier:\c00 In general, you will trust Ogier on sight.  They are a peaceful,
      long-lived people that are treated with respect wherever they go.  Only
      in the strangest of circumstances would you fight an Ogier, and
      then you would only do so with great reluctance and regret.

\c07Rebel Sedai/Warders:\c00 Their Amyrlin is Egwene Al'Vere, and, through Mat, the
      band has promised to get Egwene away from them.  Therefore, Band
      members would not attack or cooperate with them unless they think it
      would spring Egwene.  Lean away from attacking them, they are not
      really enemies.

\c07Tower Sedai/Warders:\c00 Pretty much treat them as you would the Children of the
      Light.  They do not work together, but the same general methods
      apply.  Don't mess with them directly, hinder them if you can do it
      without getting caught or implicating the Band.

\c07Seanchan:\c00 If you see one or a small few of them, get some Band members and
      capture them.  If there are a lot of them, report back to Mat or a
      higher up.  If there are any women in the group with a silver collar
      that is attached to the bracelet of another woman, STAY AWAY.  Report
      back to camp as the woman with the collar can channel.

\c07Two Rivers Folk:\c00 These are the kinfolk of General Mat.  Therefore, it
      would probably not bode well for you if you were to attack them.
      In general, they are our friends anyway, and so, even though you
      might not respect them as the battle hardened veterans you are (they
      are primarily farmers and sheepherders), you would at least
      cooperate with them.

Characters are, of course, allowed to make their own judgements about these
guilds.  These guidelines are set up to help you deal with situations you
might not be sure how to handle.

#
BANDRANKS

Here is a list and a brief description of each of the Band's ranks:

1. On Probation - This is for Band members who are in poor standing for one
   reason or another (ie. doing something that endangers the Band or its
   members, not playing for a VERY long time without good reason, etc.)
   After a suitable period of time in which this person has been a better
   Band member or after some suitable punishment is accomplished, the
   member's former rank will be restored.

2. Trainee - This is the starting rank.  You get 2 common guild skills:
   motivation and tactics.  You will also rp with different teachers to
   decide with unit you will join within the Band.  This is also where you
   receive the guild pouch and tabard.

3. After deciding which unit you will be in, you will be:
          UNIT                      RANK
          ----                      ----
          Crossbowmen               Crossbowman
          Pikemen                   Pikeman
          Cavalry                   Horseman
          Infantry                  Swordsman

   Each of these ranks is equal within the Band hierarchy.  Here you will
   also be given the guild equipment of your chosen unit.  This will either
   be a weapon and boots or a weapon, shield, and boots (don't worry, the
   stats even out no matter which you choose.)

4. Scout - These are the famed 'Scouts' of the Band.  They are the ones who
   are adept at sneaking, gathering info, and, *ahem*, appropriating
   necessary things for the band.  They generally stay out of army fighting
   unless absolutely necessary.

   This rank is equal to the Bannerman rank in the Band hierarchy.  It is
   only open to the thief class and upon taking on this rank, the member
   relinquishes affiliation with their unit in the form of exchanging their
   current guild equipment for Scout equipment.  As this is a fairly
   prestigious group, there is little chance for advancement from this
   point, so be forewarned.  (However, it should be a lot of fun.  ;)

5. Bannerman of your respective unit - This is a person of exceptional
   experience and ability when it comes to the inner workings of their unit.
   In battle, they carry the banner of their unit and operate as immediate
   leadership for the unit if problems arise.  Generally, there will be one
   for each unit unless band numbers warrant more.

   This rank is equal to the Scout rank in the Band hierarchy and receives
   the banner of their unit upon taking this rank.  Contrary to the Scout,
   however, there is still room for advancement.

6. Field Marshall - This is someone who has shown extreme valor and ability
   while in their unit.  They are also experienced in Band activities and
   are some of the best tacticians around.  Generally, one must serve as a
   Bannerman for some time before attaining this rank.  The Field
   Marshall is responsible for tactical decisions reguarding ALL units on
   the battlefield.  Their banner is traded in for a banner of the Hand,
   and they are also awarded the medal of honor.  (The final piece of
   guild equipment.)

7. Trainer - Generally, this is a wizened individual who has served in the
   Band for a good while, has show great ability to use their weapon, to
   teach the use of their weapon, and to rp.  They generally stay out of
   army combat and are primarily in charge of training new recruits and
   any in the Band who wish to learn.  There will be one for each unit.
   If you are interested in this position, ask Mat and he will tell you
   more about it.

8. Commander - This is the rank reserved for Talmanes and Nalesean, the
   seconds in command of the Band.  They are also the assistant guildleaders
   and perform the General's functions while he is away.

9. General - This rank is reserved for Mat Cauthon, the General of the Band
   and primary guildleader.

BANDRANKS2

This file explains the way the different ranks within the Band interact
with each other.

First and foremost, the Band is a unit.  Their strength is in working
together.  In general, and when there is no danger, all members of the
Band are equal.  No rank is to be pulled unless it is ESSENTIAL that
someone take charge.  If this circumstance arises, then Band members
default to following the orders of the highest ranked Band member there.
The Band member of highest rank will then be responsible for what happens.

UNDER _NO_ CIRCUMSTANCES IS A BAND MEMBER TO PULL RANK ON SOMEONE ELSE FOR
A FRIVOLITY!

This rule cannot be stressed enough.  Sending a lower ranked Band member to
get someone else for important business is necessary.  Sending them to get
your food or wash your clothes is NOT!  This goes for all situations.  If
you see this happening or are the victim of it, talk to Mat and he will
take care of it.  Persistent or major misuse of rank within the Band will
result in being placed on probation with a possible demotion.

The only wierd situation is someone who is on probation.  While on probation,
a Band member loses all rights and priviledges and must default to the
person of highest rank, irreguardless of what they were before.

Now that that's out of the way, here's how it goes rp-wise.  :)

Lower ranked Band members should respect the higher ranked ones for their
experience and ability.  They should want to learn from the people of
higher rank.  Remember: they can teach you a lot about war, tactics, weapon
handling, and being a Band member.

Higher ranked Band members should take lower ones under wing and help them
out if possible.  Tell them of your experiences, teach them some of the
finer points of warfare and weapon handling.  Tell them what they are good
at and what they should work on.  But be a friend, not a parent.  You're all
in this together, and even the General goes out and has a fun night of
gambling with his men now and again.  ;)

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

BUILDING

 Building is the creation of Zones, areas, mobs, objects and shops.
Here on Dragons Fang it's handled mostly by BUILDERs and BUILDER GLs,
even though both CREATORSs and GUILDLEADERs has been seen building from time
to time. There is a Head Builder coordinating all building activities, and
happens to be a WEAVER.

"So, what if I want to make build on Dragons Fang, how do I do?"

The best way to let us know that you wish to build for Dragon's Fang is
to let an IMMORTAL know, preferably a CREATOR or a WEAVER. An interview
will be arranged, and you are (almost always) required to appear before an
IMMORTAL council, where you will undergo questions from the IMMs there, as
well as a vote. This is the general way to apply for any kind of IMM.
  GUILDLEADER applications will be required to know the guild they are
applying for and know why they wish to lead that guild. BUILDER applicants
should have building experience, have read most of the WoT books, and have
(perhaps) an area they wish to build in mind. Keep in mind that you may be
assigned an area to build.
  All approved BUILDERs will be set as GUILDLEADER level at first, and given
an assignment of (a min.) 50 rooms, 10 objects, a few special objects, 5 or
so mobs, and a shop to complete within a month. This assignment will be
judged (by the Head Builder) and either accepted (in which case you may
be advanced to BUILDER level and given a free assignment) or denied (in which
case you may lose your IMM status).

"CHILDREN OF THE LIGHT" COTL WC WHITECLOAKS

The Children of the Light.


  A strict order, whose vows are for life, \c07The Children of the Light \c00
follow their interpretation of the Light, as written by Lothair
Mantelar, in his book, "The Way of the Light". Some people think
that they are too fanatical, too strict, too overbearing, (putting
it lightly), with their views. They do believe that they follow
the True Light, and all others, if not out and out darkfriends,
are not as pure, as Illuminated, so to speak, as they.

  Whereas some CotL are the fanatical, overbearing, vicious types,
there are some that believe truly in the calling that turned them
to the CotL, and while they still can be ruthless about their beliefs,
they take a while longer to turn to the violent methods.

There are two factions within the Children of the Light:
       \c07The Children, \c00and the \c01Inquisitors.\c00

\c07The Children \c00are the soldier types.
   The CotL have a strict chain of command, and orders are expected
to be carried out immediately, if not sooner. If there is some delay,
the under Childe will be suspected of "straying from the Light."
Children refer to other CotL, who are ranked under them, as "Childe".
Higher ranks are referred to by their ranks. A strict militaristic
group, the CotL are the soldiers of the Children of the Light, and
make up the majority of the members.

\c01The Inquisitors.\c00
   Officially, "The Hand of the Light", the inquisitors are the members
of the CotL as a whole, but somewhat seperate. The Hand of the Light,
(HotL), are the ones that have, more than anything, made the Children
a feared presence. They "question" suspected Darkfriends. They use
instruments of torture to bring the suspected Darkfriend to the Light,
"knowing" the answer before the Question is given.
   Most, if not all of them think that they are doing the True Work of
the Light, and are therefore superior to the soldiers of the Children.

\c06Guild requirements\c00

Level 20, no exceptions.
Must be a non channeler. No exceptions.
2 sponsors from already guilded members.
A working knowledge of the books is a bonus.

CLASS CLASSES
You can be one of seven classes at creation:

\c02Adventurer:\c00 A person of great skill when it comes to fighting abilities
            and wildlife survival, he is one of the sturdiest and most
            versatile classes on Dragon's Fang. Available early on to
            him are many fighting skills and equivalent.

\c02Soldier:\c00 A person used to living a fighting life, this is the class
            that has the most fighting skills available to him the earliest.
            He is very skilled in many martial arts (No, not Karate and such!)

\c02Craftsman:\c00 A person not that skilled at fighting, he/she is the only
            one skilled at retooling.

\c02Thief:\c00 Someone adept in the areas of the rogue: Stealing, sneaking,
            hiding and backstabbing in dark alleys ;), he is also very
            good at finding other thieves.

\c02Wisdom:\c00 A wisdom is normally a village wise woman with many skills
            in herblore, healing, judging differences among village
            members and governing the village as a whole. She is not at
            all adept in fighting, but has many other aces up her sleeve.

\c02Wilder:\c00 A person who has learned all by herself to channel, and if not
            helped he will most certainly die a painful death or burn
            himself out. One of the classes who at creation can wield the
            One Power at will.

\c02Channeler:\c00 A person who can be trained to use the One Power if
            he/she ever gets the proper education. Due to the power of
            the Channelers and the Wilders, they are given limited access
            to fighting skills to not overturn the balance of the mud.

#
COLORSETTING

   There are two ways to add colours to your output, description and objects:
\c01   a)\c00
   You simply type \c directly followed by any of these numbers:

        Normal text      Bold text    Backgrounds
        ===========      =========    ===========
Red         01              08            15
Green       02              09            16
Yellow      03              10            17
Blue        04              11            18
Magenta     05              12            19
Cyan        06              13            20
White       07              14            21
Dark gray   22              23            24

And -\c02don't\c00- forget to "close" the colors off afterwards!
Otherwise the colors will "bleed" into other text.
The closing-off symbol is for all codes \c directly followed by 00

\c01   b)\c00
   There is also another way to use colours , using the & symbol exactly 
like the \c sign (using &n to "close" it so that it won't "leak") :

COUNCIL
A Council of three imms has been formed to help uphold and
enforce the \c03Policy \c00(type '\c03policy\c00'), and to act as
a mediator between IC and OOC problems or issues.

Some examples that would fall into our category include, but are
not limited to, the following:

- *Any* issue that involves the \c03Policy \c00(type '\c03policy\c00'). This
  includes multiplaying, harrassment, and OOC stealing and tooling.

- IC conflicts such as determining the winner of a roleplay fight.

- OOC conflicts such as using OOC info or bug abuse.

There are numerous conflicts/issues/problems/arguments that
should be brought to our attention. Mail us with the issue and we
will question both sides before making a decision.

If you are unsure whether you should bring the issue to us, do
the safe thing and just do it; we are here to help.

Please send a tell or mail to any or all Council members with
your questions/conflicts/issues. Like I stated earlier, we are
here to help.

The Council Imms are \c03Ganic\c00, \c03Jei'reen\c00, \c03Shai'tan\c00, \c03Herid\c00 and \c03Shirine\c00.

DAES DAEMAR DAE'MAR DD
Life is a game. The object of the game is to stay on top of a
dangerous and ever changing world. This is done by many methods:
bribery, cohersion, kidnapping, assassination, and many other
dirty tricks. The people who play this game either have Light
touched ethics and ideals or do what it takes to win, caring little
for who stands in their way. This is \c06Daes Dae'mar\c00, the Game of
Houses.
\c06Daes Dae'mar \c00is a guild where you deal your hand and hope you
become the game master, not the pawn. The nobility varies greatly in
power and status, but all hold a single goal: the wish to excel in
politics and power. There are also the guards of the city or Houses,
spies hired to snoop or even kill, even lowly stablehands, maids, and
serving wenches. You can also dabble in the court system as a
Magistrate or Thieftaker. 

All seekers must be at least \c14level 20\c00 and must send a \c14background\c00
with a life story to &cDyeline and Maugan'ra&n and must \c14RP\c00 with other members of the
guild (who in turn MUST send an RP report to &cDyelin and Maugan'ra&n. The number of
sponsors necessary to be guilded changes with each seeker. It depends
on the RP and how you are rated. \c14No channelers\c00 are allowed
into the guild except on rare occasions and this rare occasion only applies
when the Channeler has written approval from Dyelin or Maugan'ra.

**The only exception to the rule of number of sponsors necessary, is for Noble
Applicants. You must send a detailed background with family and House
information and anything else planned for the rank. This sort of
background should be long and involved. Nothing less will be accepted.
Email this type of letter to:
&cDyelin:&n \c10zaria@earthlink.net\c00 and,
&cMaugan'ra:&n \c10vertigo@ala.net\c00

DAMANE
Literally, leashed-one.
  The girls born with the ability to channel are collared by the Sul'dam.
They are like dogs, controlled by a sul'dam with an a'dam (see HELP A'DAM).
They are used as weapons, using the One Power in battles.
  Depending on the talents of the Damanes, they can be trained to find
precious minerals for the Seanchan, to make a'dams, or any other tasks that
can be executed only with the One Power.  To be touched by a Damane is a
dishonor, except for the Sul'dams.  They are feared because of their power,
but beside from that, they are seen as less than human by the Seanchan.
The Damanes are the property of the Empress.  They can not do anything
without the Sul'dam's permission.  They possess nothing.  Damanes are
possessions. Most Damanes are not allowed names.

INNS TAVERNS

   Inns and taverns are placed in various places in all the lands, where
travellers can buy food and provisions or a place to spend the night.
Traditionally used as good role-playing spots, players can stay undisturbed
in private rooms, or join as groups in the common areas to hold meetings
or celebrations.

DARKFRIEND

  Darkfriend, Friends of the Dark, the Shadowsouled, Nightrunners, they have
been called by many names by many people, but they all mean the same thing:
Someone who has forsaken the light and pledged their soul and lives to
serve the Shadow. It is not easy for many people to understand why someone
would want to become a Darkfriend, but there are many possible explanations.
One possibility is that these people are seduced by promises of \c03wealth\c00,
\c02power\c00 and even \c06immortality\c00 for their service to the Dark One. Others are
perhaps castoffs from society, and seek revenge against those who scorned
them, or perhaps some are forced to serve the shadow against their will,
and eventually are mired so deep that they cannot escape. Yet despite the
methods that have brought about their oaths to the dark, we can suspect that
they have served well, for the Dark One has never been a lenient master.

There is little that is truly known about those who have pledged their lives
in service to the shadow, and much that is suspected. One thing that is
known, is that a darkfriend would rather die than betray their oaths, for it
is suspected that the Lord of the Grave has found some way to punish his
minions even beyond their own death. As for where darkfriends come from,
there has been much speculation, and little hard evidence. It seems that
anyone could be one of the Friends of the Dark, regardless of what country
they are from, or their social status, from king to beggar. Those people
who have admitted to being a darkfriend before they died, have come from
all lots in life, so it seems the Lord of the Grave will use anyone he can
to advance his goals.

            \c01<Requirements to become a Darkfriend>\c00

\c05	\c00 All classes, sexes, and races are allowed in the Darkfriend guild.

"DEATHWATCH GUARD"

A Deathwatch Guard is property of the Seanchan Empress, and her blood.
They are the elite guards, and it is an honor to be one.  The Deathwatch
Guards only obey the Empress, and no one else, not even a High Lord or
Lady, except in order from the Empress.  They have tattoos, like the
Seekers, but display them proudly, like a badge of honor, to identify
themselves: a Tower on one shoulder, and a Raven on the other.  When you
enter the Deathwatch guard, it is for life.

\c062)\c00    Your Darkfriend character must have a story, background, and a
       description. In addition to some reason for joining the Dfguild.

       RP reasons.

\c063)\c00    To speak to other darkfriends use: dt <text>. Your message will be sent
       to all darkfriends who are logged onto the mud.
       NOTE: names will not be displayed with the message because
       dt is totally OOC anyway the Dfs are not psychic!

\c064)\c00    If another character you know wants to become a darkfriend, and lets
       you know, inform one of the guildleaders (Shai'tan or Shaidar)
       as soon as you can so they can be guilded.

\c065)\c00    If someone of a higher rank gives you an order, you MUST obey it
       regardless of what it is. Abuse of this will be punished.

\c066)\c00    If someone of a higher rank requests a report on your activities, you
       MUST give one.

       mud groups second.

\c068)\c00    Darkfriends can not automaticaly know what guild a person belongs to
       by their guild Equipment or other such clues, unless it is a really
       obvious affiliation such as Whitecloak battle armor, Gleeman patchwork
       cloak, and so forth. (Basically just use common sense)

\c069)\c00   You are allowed to join another guild (if you do not already belong
       to one) after you become a Darkfriend.

\c0610)\c00  If you betray the guild in any form or fashion, your Darkfriend
       character will be Pkilled In Character.

\c0611)\c00  The only way to leave the guild is through IC character death.

\c0612)\c00  If you have an alt who is not in the Darkfriend guild, and use
       Darkfriend guild knowledge with that character, both your Darkfriend
       character, and the alt who used the information will be IC pkilled.

\c0613)\c00  You will be expected to attend all Darkfriend guild meetings, and if
       you are unable to attend, please inform the guildleaders BEFORE the
       meeting.

\c0614)\c00  Darkfriend book characters will start with the level, rank, equipment,
       skills, weaves, money, and so forth that will be deemed appropriate
       by Shai'tan and Shaidar.

\c0616)\c00  Darkfriend book characters who are also a member of another guild can
       only be assigned by Shai'tan and Shaidar in conjunction with the
       other GL(s).

\c0617)\c00 If another character has proof that your character is a member of
       the Darkfriend guild, it will be an IC reason(in most cases) for them
       to try and Pkill your character, and it will also be a reason for
       other Dfs to kill you.

\c0618)\c00  No Darkfriend guild members receive any Equipment for membership
       in the guild. Also, any and all guild skills will be restricted by rank,

Guildleaders: Great Lord / Hand of the Dark

This is the rank for the Gls, we are responsible for guilding all new
converts to the winning side.

Shai'tan handles the day to day running to the Chosen, while
Shaidar handles the day to day running of the Darkfriends.  This
is not to say we have two guilds, it is simply to say that if we are
both on go to the correct GL, it will save you time.  Please note
however, that you can go to either GL, truly we don't bite

Note: If you see Shai'tan you had better be in the Bore visiting him,
otherwise he is OOC, please remember this.  If you see Shaidar, I
might be IC, but not  usually at the board, and I do not stroll about
Caemlyn ICly either if you see me at the mail room, I am OOC.

However, if we are IC I expect groveling from everyone, with the
exception of certain Chosen with regard to me, however I will put
you in your place.

Nae'blis

The Nae'blis stands but one step below the Great Lord.
If you are graced with the presence of the Nae'blis (and they are IC)
show all the respect you can possibly give no matter who you are,
because if you annoy the Nae'blis you will probably be killed on
the spot, and neither I nor Shai'tan will much question the actions
of the Nae'blis with regard to Darkfriends, so get on your belly and
squirm.

Chosen

The Chosen are near immortals from the Age of legends, their power is far
superior to anything you might possess (unless you are the Dragon Reborn).
Chosen should be treated the same as the Nae'blis.  The one exception is
that may end up getting caught between two or more Chosen and their
different plans (which may end up with you dead or promoted depending on
how clever you are). Grovel to the Chosen, they can kill any Darkfriend
pretty much before you can blink. (however abuse of this will not be
looked on kindly, and I have been waiting to brand various people with
that amusing skill so do not abuse your power as a Chosen.)

The Chosen will also be a great help to you in getting higher ranks.
Dreadlords must be bonded to and trained by a Chosen in order to get
skills or rank, the same goes for Black Ajah members. For you non
channy DFs, you do not have to be bonded to any Chosen, although you
may find that it is useful to your career. If you are useful to a
Chosen they may reward you with greater rank.  This is because the
Chosen's recommendations are required for certain advancements in rank
(although the final decision will be made by Gls).  In other  words,
you must work with the Chosen in order to get anywhere in this guild.

 Shadow Spawn  Gholam/ Myrddraal / Drahkar/ Trolloc/ Greyman

There is no one is the rank right now, however should there ever be, only
Chosen, Nae'blis and the First Dreadlord will be able to command these
creatures, and yes they will still be relatively powerful MUDwise, but they
will only be given as rewards for outstanding RPers.  That is to say if you
show great RP you will be allowed to play a Shadow Spawn for a special
RP/Quest type deal (like attacking a city).  (NB these will be announced
well in advance)


The Master Rank

These people will be referred to as Master/Mistress and in fact they may
be your personal Master/Mistress for RP purposes.  This rank will not be
assigned it will be earned in various ways depending on the subranking.
This rank controls the actions of the members of its subrank (unless a
Chosen happens to interfere).

This rank will include the First Dreadlord, The Head of the Black Ajah,
The Spy Master, The Honored Minion, and the Master of the Records.

Be aware that the is a rank order to these five people, however, none has
any power over any of the others unless it is RP based (i.e. The Spy Master
has two or three Chosen backing his plan for the Head of the Black Ajah).
The Master of the Records has the highest mortal rank simply because
that job requires the Master of the Records to know who is on and what
is going on.

Lords

This rank will be referred to as Lord/Lady by lower ranks (with the
exception of Sitter which is its own title). These people will have the
most power with the the Great Lord and has been rewarded for it.

This ranks includes High Dreadlords, Lord Spies, The Sitters for the Black
Ajah, Lord Minions, and Master Scholars

Veteran Members

Members of this rank have no special titles, but they have proven
themselves to the Great Lord and their subrank.  These people are
skilled in the specialty of their given subrank, and generally plot
to advance their careers.

This rank includes Veteran Dreadlord, Veteran Spy, Mistress of the
Black Ajah, High Minion, and Learned Scholar

Basic Members

Members of this rank have been trained in their various subranks and proven
that they are at least competent.  Members who attain this rank are generally
begin to start they plotting for advancement either though threats, skill, or
well timed accidents.
Members with this rank are Dreadlord, Spy, Sister of the Black Ajah, Minion,
and Scholar

Subrank Trainees


Members of this rank have chosen a subranking (or had it chosen for them).
Generally this rank spends its time learning more than plotting although
there is plenty of that going around.

This rank includes Acolytes, Scouts, Accepteds, Servants, and Students.

Darkfriends and Trained Darkfriends

This is the rank everyone starts at, you must be level 20 to join, and
have the most basic of RP skills (i.e. if you are a powerleveler you
will never get any rank or addition skills nor will you live very long.)
Darkfriends must complete a few lessons given by the Scholars in order
to advance.

Trained Darkfriends are those which have passed the initial lessons required
for advancement beyond Darkfriend.  These lessons will give you a little
background into the Shadow, as well as, lessons on how to act within the
guild. These lessons are given by the scholars and you will not (I repeat)
you will not be advanced within the guild if you do not complete these
lessons to the satisfaction of the Master of the Records.

Accused / Fallen / Damned

The Accused are those Darkfriends who for what ever reason have
been accused of betraying the Shadow.  If you are set to this rank
start preparing your story because you will very soon find your
self on trial. Anyone of higher rank may accuse anyone of lower
rank (just mail Shaidar).  However, this is a very very serious thing
for you to do so be very very careful, because if the accused in found
loyal, guess who will be on trial next.....

The Fallen is a rank to be avoided.  If you are set to the Fallen rank it is
because you have pissed off one or more of the Chosen to the point
that they want you dead.  However, most Chosen consider you
so far beneath them that they simply want someone else to do it.  If
you are set to Fallen (and Yes I hope to make that a skill for Chosen)
then you need to appeal to either the Nae'blis (who will have the power
to undo it and set you as Darkfriend) or appeal to me ICly.

Do not kill a Fallen person unless a Chosen orders you to do so, then you
will do your best to kill that person no matter what the cost. Be very careful.

If you get put to Fallen unfairly or for OOC reasons appeal to either GL
OOCly. As Fallen, you will be branded as a Darkfriend for all the world
to see.  This will be IC reason for anyone to pkill you regardless of
whether or no you think it is fair. There is no deguilding for a DF,
only PK IC death.

The Damned are those who are found guilty in a trial of the accused
or have failed in their appeal from being set to Fallen.  The damned are to
be hunted down and killed.  If you see a damned person on, stop what you
are doing and kill them, these people may also be branded as a Darkfriend
depending on the circumstance. (On a side note kill anyone who is so
branded because they are either disloyal to the shadow, or possibly spies
from the Light, either way it is better that they are dead.

Dreadlord subranks

First Dreadlord

First Dreadlord: The First Dreadlord will be chosen from the High Dreadlords
through combat or threat there of.  In other words, when there is no First
Dreadlord (and more than one High Dreadlord) whoever can make the other(s)
submit will become First Dreadlord.  Now this does not have to be combat,
you could vote if you are wimpy, but then to keep your post you will likely
have to defend it from challengers. If there is a current First Dreadlord,
then they have to die in order for a new one to be considered and killing
the First Dreadlord does not mean you are the successor, in fact it may
wind up with the Chosen who supported the old First Dreadlord as your
new enemy.

High Dreadlord

The most powerful of the Dreadlords, these are the commanders of the
Trolloc armies.  High Dreadlords are chosen for outstanding RP ability
in addition to cleverness in dealing with Chosen.  You must have two
Chosen speak to Shai'tan in order to attain this rank (i.e. sponsor
you) and one of them will be your personal master and instructor
(which will be RPed as well as coded, one of them must bond you).
There is a maximum of 3 High Dreadlords.

Veteran Dreadlord

These are the seasoned commanders of the Trolloc armies.  Veteran
Dreadlords are chosen based on RP ability and demonstrated ability
as a Dreadlord. A Veteran Dreadlord must have two chosen sponsors
to attain this rank.

Dreadlord

Commanders of the Trolloc Fists, Dreadlords are chosen on the basis of RP
ability, the recommendations of the High Dreadlords, or First Dreadlord,
and having been bonded to a Chosen Master or Mistress.

Acolyte

These are Dreadlords in training, they receive no skills and are chosen
on the basis of minimal RP ability (we hold that you can improve), and
the ability to Channel.

Spy Subranks

Spy Master

Spy Master:  Chosen from the Lord Spies in a secret battle this person will
be known only to the Lord spies (i.e. it will not show who is the Spy
Master). Anyone leaking this information will have given the Lord Spies and
the Spy Master an IC reason to kill them and the person they told).  On the
death/assassination of the old Spy Master, the Lord Spies will be released
into Caemlyn (or some other large city) where they will decide by what ever
means they wish, who the next Spy Master will be.

Lord Spy

The Lord Spies are masters of deceit and cunning, they are the elite
information gatherers in the world.  Lord Spies are chosen on the basis
of RP ability in addition to a Chosen sponsor.  Lord spies do not require
the sponsorship of the Spy Master (as it is quite likely they will not
be friends).

Veteran Spy

Our highest ranking spies out in the world collecting knowledge for the
coming battle.  Veteran Spies will be selected on the basis of RP ability
and the usefulness of  the information that they provide to the Spy Master
(or me if there is none).  Veteran spies do not require Chosen sponsorship,
but it never hurts.

Spy

The trusted informants of the Shadow.  They are chosen based on RP
ability, and the vote of the Veteran and Lord Spies (tie votes mean no).
To advance from Scout to Spy requires such a vote (of at least 50% of
them), so kiss up ;)

Scout

Spies in training, chosen based on minimal RP ability, membership in a
guild other than DF.  Being a thief is highly encouraged, but not required.
You get no skills at this rank.

Black Ajah Subranks

Head of the Black Ajah

Well for now this is Alviarin.
I have spoken with Elaida on how to work it so that Alviarin can
be different from the Tower Sedai GL (mainly because I want you to be able
to kill her). Because Alviarin is now a mortal she may be killed off. If
this happens then the Black Sitters will choose the new Head in a closed
meeting, where they will be allowed to channel freely.

Sitter for the Black Ajah

Our supreme calculators within the ranks of the Aes Sedai.  Sitters will be
chosen based on their outstanding RP ability and the recommendation of
the Head of the Ajah in addition to one Chosen sponsor.  Your Chosen
sponsor will also be your master/mistress and instructor. There can only be
3 Sitters.

Mistress of the Black Ajah

Mistresses of the Black Ajah are required to bond to their Chosen instructor
(or another Chosen).  These women have shown their undying loyalty to the

Shadow and have been rewarded for it.  Mistresses of the Black Ajah are
chosen based on their outstanding RP ability (and I speak with Elaida and
Egwene regularly) both inside the Tower or Camp and inside the DF guild.

Sister of the Black Ajah

Must hold the rank of Aes Sedai within the Tower or Rebel camp. In
Addition you must have a Chosen instructor (or you do not get the skill
for this rank).

Accepted

These are either novices or accepted in the Tower/Rebel camp, although it
is possible for them to be full sisters.  Accepted must be either be in
the Tower or Rebel camp, have the ability to channel, and possess minimal
RP ability

Minion Subranks

Honored Minion

The honored minion's function is to keep track of the rest of the
minions and to report on the progress of various minions to various
Chosen.  The honored minion position is awarded by the Chosen.

Lord Minion

These are minions how have proved their loyalty to their Chosen
again and again.  They are the most trusted of the servants, the
most loyal of the Dark Friends.  Lord Minions work closely with
the Chosen they serve.  Lord Minions are promoted on the basis
of RP ability.  There is a maximum of 3 Lord Minions.

High Minion

The High minions are the head minion for a given Chosen, as such
there can be only one High Minion for each Chosen (Lord minions
counts for this purpose i.e. a Chosen cannot have both a Lord Minion
and a High Minion).  High Minions are chosen on the whim of the
Chosen.


Minion

These are the trusted servants of a Chosen.  Minions carry out
the plots of the Chosen they are bonded to.  Minions can receive
a variety of skills based upon what their Chosen teaches them.
Minions are selected on the basis of RP ability by the Chosen
they serve.

Servant

These are minions in training.  Servants must be bonded to
a Chosen to be placed in this rank.

Scholar Subranks

Master of the Records

Master of the Records: This position is given to the most senior and
still living of the Master Scholars, I think you get the point.  The
Master of the Records is responsible for keeping track of the lessons
given to the new Dark Friends. In addition the Master of the Records
is responsible for informing Shaidar when a Darkfriend is to be promoted
to the rank of Trained Darkfriend. This is not the most fun job in the
world, but if you do it well you will be rewarded quite nicely.

Lord Scholar

The Lord Scholar (there is only one) is the de facto head of the Scholars
(the actual Head being the very busy Master of the Records).  The Lord
Scholar assists the Master of the Records and keeps track of which Scholar
is teach what and to whom and reports this all the Master of the Records.
This person is selected by a vote of the three Master Scholars (if the
elect one of their own then a New Master Scholar may be chosen if there
is someone qualified).

Master Scholar

The teachers and instructors of the history and power of the Shadow.  These
people can speak several languages (and hence use the ways without getting
lost).  Master Scholars are chosen based on RP ability, the recommendation
of the Master of Records, and Two Chosen sponsors, neither of which need
be your master. There is a Maximum of 3 Master Scholars.

Scholar

Scholars are teachers in various things, they instruct the Darkfriends in
various lesson (TBA later) Scholars are chosen based on RP ability, and
completion of a series of training lessons.

Student

Scholars in training, the students life is not pleasant.  To become a student
you must have good RP skills because you will eventually be very important
to new DFs.  In addition, you must have the sponsorship of one Scholar
(or above rank).

Circles with the DF guild

Circles are RP based groups of the various subranks which operate
within the DF guild.  While there in no actual (coded) rank
assigned to a circle member there will be skills and of course
RP benefits.  I changed this to allow anyone to join a circle,
I hope you all like it better.

Shaidar

Master of the Circles

Master of the Circles:  This rank will be heavily influenced by the Chosen.
This is the most "political" of the circle ranks, so if you choose this
path, be prepared to cater to the Chosen. This position will be chosen from
the Circle Leaders by the Chosen.  If the Chosen do not agree feel free to
kill your competition.

Circle Leader

Our supreme plotters outside the Tower.  Circle leaders will be selected
on the basis of RP ability, they must have at least three people in their
circle (not including them) in addition a Circle Leader requires Three
Chosen Sponsors,

none of whom need be assigned as your master.

Circle Enforcer

This is a senior member of a circle whose job is to make sure newer
members get with the program or die.  Enforcers will be chosen by
their circle leaders.

Circle Member

These are the rank and file plotters for the Shadow.  To become a
circle member you must have minimal RP skills, and your circle leader
must approve of your joining.

DISCLAIMER

Alright, since this has to come someplace....

The owners, staff and hosterss of this mud have no control over any
information being passed in the game, and hence have no possibility to
stop, censor or in any other way tamper with or identify any information
that may be passed via the game in any way, regardless of what the
purpose of said information might be.

Long sentence, eh? What it means is; We immortals have no clue what
people might type in private, unless we're snooping someone, something
we only do if we suspect someone of cheating, or if it's necessary to
help the person being snooped. Nor does anyone else, for that matter.

We don't save logs of what people do and say, only of some special
events, such as players gaining another level, dying, quitting, etc.

We can't, therefore, take any responsibility for what others 
might type, when in this game.

No matter what.

DRAGONS FANG MUD

The Dragons Fang is a mud based on Circle 3.0 bpl 11 and the book
series called the Wheel of Time, written by Robert Jordan. This is a
mud strongly encouraging roleplay [rp], and good roleplayers will be
rewarded by entrance in the various guilds lead by the guildleaders,
who are immortals.

The idea of this mud was basically worked out by the following people:
Stefan Lindstrom, Fredrik Lannergren and Erik Soderberg, but by now the
mud has swelled so much that no credit can be given them alone, but has
to be shared to all those involved with with this mud.

Should you have any ideas at all that you think would help us out in
this rather ardous work, we'd be happy to receive them. Who knows, if
you give enough good ideas, you might become an imm yourself!

DRAGONSWORN DS
The Dragonsworn are led by Masema Dagar, a spiritual man. His followers
spread the word of the Dragon Reborn throughout the lands and convert
others to their cause of the truth of Rand al'Thor - that he is the only
salvation against the Dark One and his followers as the day of the Last
Battle approaches. Those faithful to the Dragon have been known to be
vicious and cruel on occasion in their attempts to display the truth of
their preachings. Not all Sworn are this way, however, as many strive
to help others. The Dragon and his Prophet welcome all, be you a farmer
or a soldier of war.
You must be level 20 and have two sponsors from the guild.
Send a detailed background to the Guildleaders (Valtara).
*No male Channelers*

EMPRESS

The ruler of the Seanchan is the Empress of the Nine Moons, and the symbol
of the Imperial family is the Tower of Ravens. She supposedly has the most
direct blood link to the High King, Artur Hawkwing.  The greatest honor
someone can receive is to look at the Empress' face.  Her daughter is Tuon.
The Empress have all powers.  The Empress is feared and respected.

ENTERTAINER ACTOR

To be a successful Entertainer you must be able to put on a good show.
That means Roleplay. There are many different ways to entertain, so one
never has to worry about not being able to perform. Some such ways include
Gleeman stories, Illuminator fireworks, Animal Handling, Juggling, Dancing,
Singing, and much, much more. So if you think you can make the audience
laugh at your joke or cry at your sonnet, then this is the place for you!
It is easy to join; you need only to prove you can handle a show by
performing for the Guildleader (Thom). You must also be at least level 20
and have a history sent in, but those are the only other requirements.
So put on your best (or worst) face and try your luck on the stage!

EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points
  * When you are grouped, you get exp calculated on the average level
    of the members in the group, divided on the total amount of members.
    Example: Three people are grouped, one level 20, one level 100 and
    a level 30. They get the exp a level (20+100+30)/3 = 50 would have
    gained, divided by three.

FAQ "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS" NEWBIE

   Some survival tips for you while you are new to the lands of the
Dragon's Fang; not all of them are apparent, but most of them should be
mandatory to ensure your having a good time around.

QUESTION: Where is everything?
ANSWER: Around. In this helpfile, instructions about reaching various
        places will be given starting from the recall room. You may
        always get to that room by typing "home" and pressing Enter -
        the "home" command will be working for you until you reach the
        40th level of experience.

 ---->  Type "help basic" for more about specific places.

QUESTION: Where do I find food/water?
ANSWER: Both can be found just up, north of recall near the Oval plaza.
        Just type "list" to see what is available, and "buy <item>" to
        buy something that caught your eye. For example, "buy bread" .

        To get water, just type "drink fountain" and if you have a water
        container (which you can buy from that same room if you type
        "buy skin" you can also type "fill skin fountain" and later on
        in the game "drink skin" to drink wherever you are until you
        empty it. There is a fountain in the Oval plaza.

QUESTION: How do I get in a guild?
ANSWER: You must be at least level 20 before you can join a Guild in the
        Dragon's Fang. Other than that, Role Playing your character as
        seeking your Guild of choice will draw attention to you, and you
        will be able to be guilded.
        Type "help guild" at this point for more information.

QUESTION: What are all those acronyms people use? (AFK, OOC, etc)
ANSWER: Type "help acronyms" to find what most of those mean. Ask for
        help from an immortal if you need help on something not included
        there.

QUESTION: How do I mail someone?
ANSWER: Walk to the postmaster and type "mail <person>" . End the message
        with @@ in an empty line and press enter. The postmaster is
        conveniently just Up from recall.


QUESTION: Where do I talk to lots of people at once?
ANSWER: There is a public channel called OOC which is available for
        everyone to use after reaching the 2nd level or experience. Just
        type "OOC <message>" to use it, like "OOC Hey all!" .
        Remember that since this is a public channel, you are assumed to
        use it wisely. That means, avoid spamming, and please DO not use
        four letter words to express your feelings.

QUESTION: Where do people Role Play around here?
ANSWER: Lots of places. For starters, check out the Oval Plaza (just up,
        north, west of recall), or the Golden Bowl inn (three east,
        down from the Oval plaza) .
        Or use tells/the OOC channel/the IC channel to find out where to
        find people.

QUESTION: I am low level. Where do I go to advance in levels?
ANSWER: In the first few levels, before you are powerful enough or have
        friends to help you and eq to enhance you, you are suggested to
        walk around the city you are in and use the consider command on
        mobs (monsters, guards, etc) you encounter. if you are in
        Caemlyn like most people, kill suspicious whitecloaks,
        flies, a bit later on annoying peddlers to level.
        In most cases, leveling is a matter of trial-and-error. You may
        die a few times before you understand how things work. *smile*

QUESTION: Is Player Killing allowed on the Dragon's Fang?
ANSWER: Type "help pk" .

#

#
FOOD DRINK

  Just like in Real Life(tm) you have to drink and eat, in order to keep
your stamina. On Dragons Fang, you can't die neither from thirst, nor
hunger. But, the more hungry and/or thirsty you become, the longer it'll
take you to regain mana, hitpoints and moves. And being stuck in the
Blight without food or water, and no strength to defend yourself, is
NOT a good position in life. :)
#
FORSAKEN

  The Forsaken is the name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes
Sedai of the age of legends, thus among the most powerful ever known;
who went over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow in return
for the promise of immortality. The Forsaken were cast into the Dark
One's prison when Lews Therin and the Hundred companions resealed the
bore, the counterstroke of this by the Dark One resulted in the male
half of the True Source becoming tainted. Among themselves, and other
darkfriends, the forsaken are known as "the Chosen" those mortals who
have been chosen by the Dark One to become one of his Immortal servants.
The names of the forsaken are:
\c02Aginor, Asmodean, Balthamel, Be'lal, Demandred, Graendal, Ishamael,
Lanfear, Mesaana, Moghedien, Rahvin, Sammael and Semirhage.\c00
It is believed by those with current knowledge of the events in the
world that only Demandred and Sammael remain living among the men; and
only Graendal, Mesaana, Moghedien, and Semirhage among the women.!
(However, it is most likely that two of the Forsaken were brought back
from the grave as Aran'gar and Osan'gar, both who wield Saidin).
  A number of strange encounters, and activities suggest the possibility
either that several new Chosen have been selected by the Dark One; or
that the Lord of the Grave has in some cases reached beyond death.


Becoming one of the Forsaken:

ALL Forsaken are book characters and need to be interview by the DF/FS GLs.

To apply for one of the forsaken book characters, you must Mudmail Shai'tan,
or Shaidar with a formal application for the character you are interested in.
Please include the following information in the application:


1) The name of the Forsaken book character you are interested in.
2) Which of the Wheel of Time books you have read.
3) Why you are interested in this character.
4) What other characters you have played on Dragon's Fang, including other
   book characters.
5) Any guilds you have belonged to on Dragon's Fang.
6) How often you will be able to play the character.
7) Any other information you wish me to know.

Sometime after Shai'tan or Shaidar receives your application, you will be
contacted either by Mud mail, or personally if Shai'tan or Shaidar are on
at the time. You will be informed if your application has been accepted,
or refused, and why. If you are accepted, you will be interviewed by
Shai'tan, who will ask you between 15 to 35 questions to determine your
book knowledge. If you pass this test, you will be given the character
you have applied for.

(Note from Shai'tan)
  To all those who wish to play one of the dreaded forsaken, there are two
pieces of information you should know. One, you can apply for one of the
forsaken book characters that is already taken, and if I think you will
perform better than the existing person, you will replace him/her. Second,
if you join the forsaken guild you CAN NOT have any other darkfriend 
characters on Dragon's Fang. This rule exists so that the forsaken will 
be an active part of the mud; and there will be no exception to this 
rule, ever.

GLEEMAN GLEEWOMAN

  Gleemen. Gleewomen. People of the world. Performers. Salt of the
earth, so to speak. Adventurers? Rogues? Assassins? Fools? Whatever the
case may be, if you want to be one, this is the place to do so.
  Gleemen are wanderers of the realms, out on their own trying to earn a
living in their own special way, by performing for the sake of others..
and if needed, even more. Their only common characteristic, the colorful
patchwork cloak, one you can dislike but can never ignore or miss.
What Gleemen (and gleewomen) actually perform is up to them, whether
it is singing they prefer, or the telling of tales, stories of faraway
places and people who are considered legend, great battles or deeds,
dances, formal or otherwise... Or it may run to the more exotic arts and
performances, like eating the  occasionaly blade or two.. a torch.. or
what might impress their audience.
  What we ask from you before you join us, is the 20th level of
experience. At this point you have proven you have more than a basic
knowledge of what the Mud is all about, that you have IC knowledge of
people and active relations with some of them. But that's just one of the
basic requirements.
  The real requirement is that you \c14RP.\c00 Being IC is the normal mode for
the Gleemen, not the exception to the rule -- this, after all, the
most RP-based Mud imaginable, since you will need to seek out, gather,
and impress your audiences with your masterful performances.
We do have an active ranking system.. Or at least, we will have one
quite soon. It won't be very official, and will not hold up any
importance to anyone else outside the Guild, nor will it give the right
to command other member of "lower rank" in any way to rank holders. But
it will be a strong indication of where you stand in the Guild, how well
you have proven your worth as a performer, how much respect you hold
among others like you, or the world at large.
  As for \c02Guild Policies\c00.. There is a simple rule -- as long as you Role
Play your character, there aren't any. Gleemen and gleewomen are free
persons, free to act as they wish as far as your Guild Leaders are
concerned. You can be good or evil, darkfriends or tinkers, you can be
wolf brothers or failed shadowspawn experiments.. But be IC, please.
If you want to join us, some mud mail to the GL (Thom) would help. In it,
you must include the basic background of your character (who she/he is,
where she/he came from), and if you want, why she/he decided to become a
Gleeman. After that, you will be asked to perform for us once, and if you
are worth it.. you will be apprenticed to the most popular guild
everywhere (which we aren't really, but would like to believe we are).
That is all. Enjoy.
\c14NOTE: \c00This Guild is actually called Entertainers.

GOOOC GOIC
\c02   The OOC and IC states of a character on Dragon's Fang is easily
determined with simple code; this will affect everything you do in
different ways - here is how it works.\c00
   Any given character can either be \c01IC\c00 or \c01OOC\c00 at any given
time. Type:

\c01GOIC\c00 to switch to In Character mode. Now, you will be In Character
where you are on the MUD (you cannot claim to be Out of Character if someone
wishes to Roleplay with you in the room you are in). All your channeling is
considered to be IC - and if you overchannel, you burn out. Your taint, if
you are a male channeler, may increase with various results.
   You can always switch to In Character mode simply by typing this command;
nothing can prevent you from Roleplaying whenever you feel like it.
\c01GOOOC\c00 to switch to Out of Character mode. Now, you will be considered
to be Out of Character wherever you are. You may still burn out, and, of
course, channeling is still IC. On the other hand, you cannot see what
In Character people are saying or doing while in this mode.
   In order to be able to switch to Out of Character mode, you mustn't have
Roleplayer anything for a small while - that is, not have used the "emote"
and "say" commands for a small time period.

#
GUILD GUILDS

  The Guild area is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles
and perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only
members may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people
come to learn and practice the skills of their trade.

The guilds that you can join are the following:

\c06	\c07Aiel:\c00
          The descendants of the people who worked as servants before
          the Breaking, they are considered to be the fiercest warriors
          living, as a group regarded. The live in the Three-Fold Land
          and refer to all other peoples as 'Wetlanders'

\c06	\c07Asha'man:\c07
          Male channelers who have joined a society to aid the Dragon
          Reborn at Tarmon Gaidon, the Last Battle. They are considered
          to be the elite forces following the Dragon Reborn as they can
          wield Saidin, but the price is high; they will all eventually
          go mad because of the Taint on Saidin placed there by the Dark One.

\c06	\c07Band of the Red Hand:\c00
          A rather haphazard group of people all following
          Mat Cauthon, a Ta'veren with incredible luck and one of the child-
          hood friends of Rand al'Thor. This 'army' has so far never lost.

\c06	\c07Children of the Light:\c07
          A group of zealous, some say fanatic, soldiers
          in a rigid army regarding themselves to be the only true followers
          of the Light. They have been accused of many transgressions, but
          never so that others can hear; they are numerous and very skilled
          fighters.

\c06      \c07Daes Dae'mar:\c00
          A guild that spans across the entire Nation and consists of
          Nobles, guards, Magistrates, Thieftakers, servants, and more,
          all willing or forced players of the Gr. These people
          will lie, poison, act diplomatic, or even assassinate to get
          what they want: bettering themselves and their rank or House.

\c06	\c07Darkfriend:\c00
          People who for different reasons have turned to the Shadow
          and now follow the Lord of the Dark. This is the only guild that
          people can join together with another guild.

\c06    \c07Entertainers:\c00
          Rogues of the lands, bearers of tales and myths. They make a man
          a legend or leave him as nothing more than a speck of dirt on the
          ground. Entertainers come in many forms: Gleeman with rich stories
          or saucy bartunes, Illuminators and their mystical fireworks,
          actors of the stage, trainers and performers of traveling
          menageries. These men and women travel often and try to evade
          being tied down by anything.
        
\c06	\c07Forsaken:\c00
          They call themselves the Chosen are -very- few, a dozen or
          so. They are those who have been selected by the Dark One to
          be immortals as reward for a long service, spanning over millenia
          in most instances. They are invariably superb channelers and
          fighters, better than almost all mortals, and most people regard
          them as myths or sagas. ALL Chosen are book characters and need
          to apply by interview.

\c06      \c07Hunters of the Horn:
          Those who have taken the Oath at the Square of Tammuz in Illian
          and now dedicate their time in search of the legendary Horn
          of Valere. Many of these Hunters become legends themselves;
          Gleeman sing praises even to those long gone. It is said that
          whoever finds the Horn of Valere will become a true legend.

\c06	\c07Ogier:\c00
          A race of very large, very kind and very slow people, who are
          spoken of as the Builders, due to their superb skills in building
          cities and pieces of art. They live in Steddings and live a very
          long life, more than three centuries generally. Lately the have
          become shy and secluded and keep to their Steddings.

\c06	\c07Rebel Aes Sedai:\c00
          Aes Sedai who have broken with the Tower and now are
          placed in Salidar. They are ruled by Egwene al'Vere, a childhood
          friend of Rand al'Thor.

\c06	\c07Rebel Warders:\c00
          Warders who follow their Sedai who have broken with the Tower.

\c06	\c07Seanchan:\c00
          People coming back across the Aryth Ocean to reclaim what
          they think of as theirs: the rest of the world. They are the
          descendants of Artur Hawkwing, one of the greatest rulers that
          ever has lived.

\c06    \c07Tuatha'an:\c00
          People who follow The Way of the Leaf, a way of nonviolence and
          happiness, commonly called Tinkers. Most people, especially in
          large cities, view the Tinkers with fear, as they are reputated
          (without much evidence) to steal and subvert youths. Tinkers
          spend their lives traveling from place to place in colored wagons


\c06	\c07Tower Aes Sedai:\c00
          Aes Sedai who chose to stay with the Tower when it split,
          and who still are governed by Elaida, the Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon.
          The Tower Aes Sedai have little but contempt for those who became
          rebels, but are still trying to make them come back.

\c06	\c07Tower Warders:\c00
          The Warders to the Sedai that chose to stay in the Tower
          when it split. They are also called the Younglings.

\c06	\c07Two Rivers:\c00
          People from the Two Rivers area following Perrin Aybara, a
          Ta'veren and a childhood friend of Rand al'Thors. They have the
          banner of ancient Manetheren, the kingdom which was situated there
          many centuries ago, as their symbol.

You need to be \c03level 20\c00 before you can join any Guild on the Dragon's
Fang, except for the Tuatha'an, who are not allowed to level.

   After you reach the 20th level of experience (thus proving you know at
least some basic things about the Mud, and that you have a certain degree
of dedication - enough to level that far) you may Role Play and seek the
Guild of your choice.

Remember to seek your Guild in an \c02IC\c00 way - that is, seek the one most
appropriate to the way you want to play your character, not according to
the bonuses you will get in skills or the power of its equipment.
   For most Guilds around, there are specific help files. You can try
typing "\c03help <Guild name>\c00" for details, or ask on the OOC channel about
it. Alternatively, you may contact that Guild's own Guild Leaders (the
Immortals responsible for it) to ask anything you may need.

         \c01See also info on each guild for more information.\c00
#
GUILDWALK

   To assist Role Playing, you can type \c01guildwalk\c00 to travel back to your
assigned guildarea. You can only do this whenever you could normally recall,
and it's strictly against policy to use the command to escape RP.
   The rigorous trip also leaves you particularly exhausted.

         \c01See also information on guilds - type "\c02help guild\c00\c01".\c00

#
HEALING

  On a mud you fight mobs, gain experience and inevitably get hurt.
There are several ways to heal. The simplest is to simply wait; you get
Hitpoints, Movement points and Mana points back each mud hour (about one
minute). If you rest or sleep, you heal faster. If you are hungry or
thirsty, you heal more slowly.
  There are also healing weaves which the channelers can weave upon you,
should you be fortunate enough to be friends with one.
  The third alternative, if you are impatient and don't know a channeler,
is to go to a healing house and type "heal <(amount) | all>". Beware, though,
that for each point hitpoints you heal there, it costs you one coin.
  Additionally, Immortals sometimes heal or refresh the mud, so be nice to
them. ;)

  If you \c01burn out\c00 - or are stilled (i.e. lose the ability to channel)
try to find someone ICly who can heal you - IMMs are \c01_not_\c00 there to
heal you whenever you need it. If you are leveling and are near to burning
out, type 'home' and go to the Oval, where you can release without burning
out.
#
"HIGH NOBLE"

  They are the most important nobles below the Empress.  They each own Houses
and control them.  They have some servants assigned to that house (soldiers,
so'jhin, lower nobles, citizens, Sul'dams).  In their House, they are the
supreme ruler, and they can command everything.  All Seanchan must obey a
High Noble, even if they do not belong to their House.  Only the Seekers and
the Deathwatch guards are the exceptions, since they belong to the Empress.
They have some power over a High Noble, but they must be careful how they use
that power.

HINTS

Some general hints: (in random order)

1)  Do not annoy others.
2)  Don't be easily annoyed.
3)  If annoyed, ask an Imm for help, don't try to deal in the matter with
    Pkills, or harassment or similar. This will earn you nothing but
    unpleasant surprises.
4)  If harassed, feeling unfairly treated or anything like that, even if
    the source of your troubles are an Imm, see No3. No one is above the law
    ghere on Dragons Fang, no matter their position.
5)  Be helpful towards other players, it will make it easier for you to
    gain help in return, come the day YOU are in trouble.
6)  Remember the magic word, Gimme! :) Nah, the magic word is PLEASE, using
    this small and seemingly insignificant word, you might get help 9 times
    out of 10.
7)  Save often, although the game autosaves all characters every minute,
    a lot of things can happen between saves, and if the MUD crashes...
8)  If (when) AutoQuests are implemented, do NOT give away solutions to
    players trying to solve it. Subtle hints are allowed at your own
    descretion, but if we found out ANYONE giveing away clear descriptions
    on how to solve a certain quest. That person is up for a guided tour in
    the Freezer!
9)  Make sure you got food and water with you all the time. If you can
    channel, the spells "Create Water" and "Create Food" might be
    interesting.
10) Do not Pkill, unless the fight is a result from RP. We're harsh
    with ANY un-justified Pkills.
11) Use your common sense, and the golden rule in your dealings with both
    mortals and immortals on DF, and you will be Ok in 99 times of 100.

#
HOME

This command will take your character to it's homeroom. The homeroom
is defined by which race you've chosed at creaton. For Instance,
a Borderlander will be transfered to Fal Dara, a Seanchan to
Seandar.
*NOTE that many homerooms have not yet been set. You may end up in Caemlyn.

HUNTERS GREAT HORN VALERE

Have you ever dreamed of riding alongside the legendary Rogosh
Eagle-Eye or fighting side by side with Gaidal Cain and the
Golden Haired Birgitte? Travel the world like Jain Farstrider
in your search for the legendary \c03Horn of Valere!\c00 The call for
the \c03Great Hunt for the Horn\c00 has been declared. Now \c03Heroes,\c00
Adventurers, and even \c01Rogues\c00 have set out to claim the glory
of discovering the elusive \c03Horn \c00and becoming legends themselves.

Seek out the \c03Horn of Valere \c00and gain \c01Fame!\c00 Glory! \c03Riches!\c00 There
is always the possibility of \c23danger \c00and perhaps even \c01death.\c00
Do you have the skill and determination to overcome the obstacles
to become a true \c03Hero\c00?

If this is so, and you wish to take the oaths in the Square of
Tammuz in the glorious city of \c03Illian\c00, you must be level 20 and
mail a \c01background history \c00of your character to the Hunter GL(s).
This history must lead up to the reason why your character
wishes to become a \c03Hunter of the Horn\c00, be it for Greed, Glory,
or even for the good of the land. Once this is done, you will
encounter one or more actual Hunters. They will test your
skill in roleplay. You should be contacted within a week
or less as to whether you shall be traveling to take the oaths
at \c03Illian\c00.

#
ILLUMINATORS FIREWORKS

  The Illuminator Chapterhouse of every major city is almost as closely
guarded as is the treasure chamber of a king. The secret of making the
magic of the night sky is the least known and most searched for secret
of the Ages. Illuminators tend to work detached from the normal rabble
of the city, though they love to visit and give performances to the
people. Although a firework display can cost lots of gold, no one you
ask will say it is not worth it. If an Illuminator is even rumored to
be visiting a town, the whole place explodes with excitement.
  So be an Illuminator! Hold the secret of fireworks in your palm and
dazzle audiences with it! Just beware of blowing up your own hand..
To become an Illuminator, we ask that you reach the level of 20.
The only other requirement is that you Roleplay, and that you send a
mail to the Leader of the Guild (Thom) in order to be considered. You
should have a history of your character as well as reasons why he/she
wishes to become an Illuminator.
\c14NOTE: \c00Illuminator is a part of the Entertainer Guild.

#
IMMORTALITY IMM
  Sooner or later, if you continue to play here at Dragons Fang, you WILL
run into something called Immortals. :) They're everything from:

  \c08CREATOR\c00s     (The IMMs who head and run DF)
  \c09WEAVER\c00s      (Coders, who do the hard stuff :P)
  \c10HEADBUILDER\c00s (There's only one, in charge of mud areas, bugs, etc.)
  \c11GROOVY GL\c00s   (Who do busy work, or something)
  \c14ENGINEER GL\c00s (Promoted  Guildleaders)
  \c12ENGINEER\c00s    (Promoted Builders)
  \c07BUILDER GL\c00s  (Guildleaders who also build in multiple zones)
  \c05ARCHITECT\c00s   (Promoted Builders, keep building rights)
  \c04GUILDLEADER\c00s (Run guilds, yes?)
  \c06QUESTOR\c00s     (Just what it says, they run quests if you're lucky).
  \c05CARPENTER\c00s   (Intro Level Builders)
  \c06NEWBIE IMM\c00s  (So you wanna IMM?)

Contrary to most other MUDs you CAN'T gain Immortality by bashing mobs, once
you've reached lvl 199 (the highest mortal level) you won't simply gain any
xp for your kills. Even though the code says that you do. Immortality is a
gift for those who do their best, and devote some time, (ehr, haven't I said
this already? :)) NOT for beeing the MUDs biggest mob-basher.

Time devotion is very important to the staff. Because of this, if you are
considering applying to be a Questor, Guildleader, or Builder, you will
need to have acquired 120 hours total (all your characters combined) and
have been playing on this mud for at least 10 weeks.

#
IMPLEMENTOR CREATOR

The most powerful being in existence. On Dragons Fang these are called
Creators.
#
JENN
  The "thirteenth clan" of the Aiel, the way of the Jenn has not been
seen since the Breaking of the World. Originally called the Da'shain,
these Aiel served the Aes Sedai while following the Covenant, also termed
the Way of the Leaf (see HELP TINKERS). When the Breaking occured, these
peaceful Aiel were forced to travel in search of a safe place for a large
cargo entrusted to them by the Aes Sedai. It is the Aiel belief that this
safe place was never found and that they had failed the Aes Sedai.

  During the long years of traveling, the Da'shain split twice: the first
came when Sulwin took many Aiel away to find what he called the Seed Song.
These people were the original Tuatha'an. Because they left the Da'shain
and their promise to the Aes Sedai, they became Lost.  The second split
brought about the Aiel we know today. This idea of violence and fighting
as a way to protect oneself changed most of the Da'shain. These new Aiel
called the peaceful ones the Jenn (Old Tongue for Dedicated) and protected
them until the Jenn disappeared completely.

\c01See also\c07 HELP AIEL, HELP JI'E'TOH, HELP WETLANDERS\c00

#
JI'E'TOH
  The Aiel live by a code of honor and duty - Ji'e'toh, which prescribes
the correct behavior for any situation. Ji'e'toh isn't a written code, but
rather a taught way of living for the Aiel.
  For example, if someone incurs toh toward someone else, only the person
who has committed the wrongdoing can ascertain whether he or she has Toh
towards the other person or not. You cannot tell someone else that they
owe you Toh, else this incurs even more Toh, as well as offends the Ji
(honor) of the other person.
  There are many paths to gaining JI or TOH, and not all are in battle. The
paths to earning Ji in battle are many, as are the ways which Toh is gained.
For example, the greatest Ji is earned by touching an armed and living enemy
without causing harm. The smallest path to earning Ji is to kill, for anyone
can kill. Somewhere in the middle of these two extremes is taking someone
gai'shain (a servitude of a year and a day, in which the gai'shain cannot
wield weapons and must wear white, among other customs).
  Shame has many levels in Ji'e'toh, and is considered to a worse occurance
than pain, injury or even death on many of those levels.
  There are many ways of meeting Toh, but even the smallest infraction must
be met in full. Toh outweighs all other considerations, to the extent that
Aiel will accept shame to fulfill an obligation that may seem minor to an
outlander.

KIN "THE KIN"
  The Kin are essentially a secret society of women channelers who have
hidden headquarters in Ebou Dar, a port city northwest of Illian and far
to the south of Caemlyn.
  They number more than 2000 in number, far outnumbering the number of
Sedai that have existed, even before the White Tower split into two
factions. Most, if not all, are novices and accepted that have, in the
past, either refused to be tested for the shawl in the White Tower, or
have not been found adequate for the shawl for several reasons. However,
Sedai are still revered by the Kin.
  As Kin, you will be sworn to secrecy, as no one outside the Kin know
that we exist, and spreading of such knowledge is certainly frowned upon,
as it threatens our safety. Many Kin are healers, as this Talent seems
abundant in Wise Women, which some of us are.
  As a guild, Kin requirements are level 20 (as are all guilds), female,
channeler/wilder/or born with the spark, a history submitted to the Reanne,
and possible some RP with present Kin members or the GL.

\c01See also\c07: KINRANKS, KINSUBRANKS, KINRP\c00
#
KINRANKS
  As the Kin attempt to emulate the Aes Sedai as much as they can, short of
claiming that they are Aes Sedai and wearing the serpent ring, the ranks
of this guild reflect this attitude toward the White Tower:
  \c02Guarded\c00 - those that have runaway from the Tower, and are being
            held to be returned.
  \c02Wilders\c00 - those that the Kin have found to channel naturally, but
            have not been to the Tower. Most, if not all, will be turned
            over to the Tower (the Rebel Sedai, since Elayne Sedai forged
            an alliance with the Kin). Many wilders are the apprentices
            of nearby Wise Woman.
  \c02Apprentice\c00 - Once a woman is taken in by the Kin, she begins a
            training that attempts to emulate the training they had
            previously received.
            There are 5 subranks for Apprentices:
               Apprentice [Initiate]
               Apprentice [Practiced]
               Apprentice [Advanced]
               Apprentice [Prepared]
               Apprentice [Learned]
            Advancement through these 5 ranks depends on a loose
            syllabus and active RP with Wise Women and Elders.
  \c02Wise Woman\c00 - Once done with your Apprentice Training, you
            become a full Wise Woman, and can begin a Healing shop if you
            so choose. Since the Kin focus a lot on healing weaves, and
            since many of the Kin were Wise Woman trained in the Ebou Dari
            tradition, there is an abundance of healers in the Kin. Most
            Kin know beyond the basics of healing using the One Power.
            There are 7 subranks for Wise Women to choose from (see help)
  \c02Mistress of the Runaways\c00 - She takes care of those who have run away from
            the Tower.
  \c02Mistress of the Wilders\c00 - She takes care of the Wilders and makes sure
            they train at the Tower.
  \c02Mistress of Apprentices\c00 - She arranges the lessons and advancement of
            Apprentices.

KINRP
  The Kin are a secret society of women channelers, so no word should be
spoken mentioning the Kin or anything related to the location of the Kin
farm. Noting the dangers of anyone knowing that a Kinswoman can channel,
Kin should also be very very reluctant to spread knowledge that she can
channel. Also, a Kinswoman should avoid channeling in public to an extreme,
even if she thinks she is alone. All healing weaves should be done near
a Wise Woman or healer's shop, and should be disguised by using herbs and
other supplies as well.
  If a Kin reveals the location of the farm or the existance of the Kin to
an outsider, she will be punished severely, possibly stilled and put under
guard. Pains will be taken to remove traces of the farm or the existance
of the Kin.
  The Kin revere Aes Sedai, and according respect should be shown to them
if their presence is known. Likewise, a Kin should never channel within
a league of an Aes Sedai (another reason to keep public channeling secret)
and should conceal their channeling ability near Aes Sedai (this is one
of the basic weaves taught to apprentices).
  After apprenticeship, Kinswoman are free to leave the farm or their place
of apprenticeship and do as they choose, always remembering their ties and
allegiance to the Knitting Circle and remembering the location of the Kin
farm near the Rahad and Kin messengers throughout the land (all Kin should
know the marker for a Kin informant on healer's shops).

KINSUBRANKS
  The Kin model themselves after the Aes Sedai, and the subranks of their
Wise Women as well as their Elders reflect that:

  [\c10Scholar\c00]    - those who study and wish to learn; bookworms.
  [\c07Philosopher\c00]- those who take themselves up with the questions of life.
  [\c01Seeker\c00]     - those who spend their time finding runaways and other
                 girls from the Tower.
  [\c03Healer\c00]     - those who heal beyond the normal
  [\c02Defender\c00]   - those who choose to protect the Kin and guards its
                 secrecy.
  [\c14Mediator\c00]   - those who wish to spend their time mediating the many
                 quarrels of their native city of Ebou Dar, as well as
                 others.
  [\c04Traveler\c00]   - those who spend their time in other lands, healing and
                 gathering information, spending their time on various
                 causes.

LOTD LEGION

The Legion of the Dragon is a group of soldiers who have dedicated
themselves to fighting for the Lord Dragon and his glory. The main camp of
the Legion is located north of Caemlyn, although smaller chapters exist in
other places. The other places are not revealed to many people, however.
The Legion owes no allegiance to any country or rulers, except for the
Dragon. \c01(THIS GUILD IS DISBANDED).\c00

A list of the ranks for the Legion is as follows:

AWOL
Recruit
Trainee
Footman
Pikeman
Bowman
Crossbowman
Horseman
Master Footman
Pikeman Leader
Master Bowman
Master Crossbowman
Master Horseman
Medic
Trainer
Commander
Chief Medic
Master of Training
Battallion Commander
General
Lord General

The rank of General is the highest attainable by a mortal. The Lord General
rank is for that of guildleaders only. The Master of Training is in charge
of training new recruits and dealing with soldiers who have become
uncooperative. The Battallion Commander and General, both of which are a
rank that may only be filled by one person at a time, help the guildleaders
will things and help organize the troops during combat.

The rank of AWOL is for soldiers who fail to follow assignments, wander off
during training, or generally prove they still need more training. Soldiers
who are in the AWOL rank will lose some guild equipment or guild skills if
it becomes apparent that the soldiers merely have joined for equipment or
skills and do not really care about helping the Legion.

In the case of a spy being caught, a trial will be help with a guildleader
presiding. The General, Battallion Commander, and Master of Training will
help will the trial process. A guilty verdict for one who has either been
leaking secrets, shown to be definitely affiliated with the dark one, or
some other caliber offense will be dealt with harshly. A probable
punishment of such crimes would be death.

Those who wish to join the Legion of the Dragon should seek out a
recruiter. If one cannot be located, send mudmail to Taernim or Morgard.
This is a RP guild, so do not apply if you only want eq or skills...

LOCATE
   When you use this skill, you have a chance of discovering hidden players
in your room. You can't search very often, but if you find someone spying on
you he/she will be unable to hide for a limited time period as you confront
them.

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

\c01If however, you were looking for a help file on LINKING (i.e. with channelers)
then go to: \c07HELP LINKING\c00
#
LINKING
  All channelers can link (join their power) with other channelers. Linking
has the advantage of increasing your grasp of the One Power - the more people
link the more mana they have, and the stronger weaves they can weave.
You can link with a channeler who is female or male - up to thirteen female
channelers can link and up to two male ones can link, without the aid of
a female channeler. More than two male channelers need a female to link
with them, as do more than thirteen female channelers. Above these numbers,
male and females need to alternate in order to extend the link.
  Here at Dragon's Fang, linking is coded to be very Wotish and IC. You need
to grasp (if you cannot grasp, make sure you are both a channeler and not
in a room which does not allow channeling), have the other person grasp, and
type "link <person>." Remember to Dissolve the link when you are done! Else,
the other person will end up being linked and following you forever :)

#
MAIL MUDMAIL
There is a mailing system withing the Dragons Fang, and if you find the
place where the postmaster is you can mail the other players. The stamp
price is currently 1 coin, so there should be no monetary problems.

All you do when you are in that room is simply this:

>mail (person)
[Write the mail contents and finishing by typing @ at a new line]

And there you are! You have now mailed that person.

#
MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana, but
still cast the spell, you run the risk of losing your ability to cast spells
(called Stilling for women and Gentling for men) or even dying.

MARATH'DAMANE

  The name given to a girl born with the ability to channel (spark).  They
are wilders, and they would learn to channel by themselves.  They do not
need someone to teach them.  The translation of the name means: those who
must be leashed. The Seanchan think that every woman who can channel must
be collared and controlled for the safety of everyone else. The Aes Sedai
are for the Seanchan marath'damanes, since they can channel, but they have
not been safely collared yet.
  Each year, in every village of Seanchan, the Sul'dams go and test every
girl with an a'dams, trying to find more Damanes and Sul'dams.  There is
then a big festival, and the event of testing is very well seen by the
citizens.  The girls with the spark are collared and made Damanes, brought
along with the girls that can be taught to channel and made Sul'dams.
  The Seanchan do not know that Sul'dams are latent channelers, and only
believe that the ones that are going to be Damanes can wield the one power.
However, both people on the side of an a'dam bond can channel.

"THE BLOOD"

High Lord/Lady

These nobles are the most important below the Empress.  They own property
and are always vying for the Empress' favor so that their house might see
greater honor. They have some servants assigned, or bought for their
house.  In their House, they are the supreme ruler, and they can command
everything.  All Seanchan must obey a High Lord/Lady, even if they do not
belong to their House.  Only the Seekers and the Deathwatch guards are
exceptions, since they belong to the Empress.  They have some power over
the High Lord/Lady, but they must be careful how they use that power.


Of the Blood

This is the first noble rank on can attain in the Seanchan Hierarchy.  It
is through great valour that one can attain such a rank, and only the
Empress herself can bestow such a rank.

So'jhin

The So'jhin are special servants to a High Lord/Ladyy, trained from birth
how to serve properly.  Only trusted servants with high talents can be
raised to this rank, and it is a symbol of honor.  Only a High Lord/Lady
or one Of the Blood can raise a servant to So'jhin.  They are members of a
police/spy organization for the High Lord/Lady they serve, like the
Seekers for the Empress.  They have many powers, but not as
much as the Seekers.  Their power is limited to the High Lord/Lady's
House.

NOBILITY NOBLES
  When someone mentions Nobility he usually is referring to a Lord, Lady,
Duke, Prince, possibly a Queen or King. On Dragon's Fang you may play
your character with a noble rank if you happen to be from such a family.
Usually, nobles have their hands deep in politics and subterfuge and so
play the game of \c11Daes Dae'mar \c00(see \c01HELP DAES DAE'MAR\c00). Some
nobles, usually the sons and daughters of an established Lord, end up
leaving their manor to find adventure on such grand quests as the Hunt
for the Horn (see \c01HELP HUNT\c00) or by joining a group that follows
the excitement of Ta'veren (see \c01HELP BAND\c00). There are also a few
nobles known from other lands (see \c01HELP SEANCHAN\c00).
  There are many Houses already in existance, as well as those waiting
to be occupied. Should you want to roleplay with noble birth, you must
either speak with a noble of a House or apply (with a detailed background)
to the Daes Dae'mar Guildleader.

#
OGIER
   The Ogier are a non human race characterized by great height(average
being 10 feet tall)broad almost snoutlike noses, and long, tufted ears.
They live in areas called stedding. Their separation from these steddings
after the breaking of the world created the longing; an Ogier that stays
to long outside a stedding feels this longing and if to long out they can
die of it. Widely reknowned for their stone work and building of the great
human cities they consider their stone work simple compared to their
wonderful works of Treesinging; the process by which an article is moulded
by singing to a tree and bending the tree to the shape that you want
Treesung wood objects are very hard and durable (practicably unbreakable)
   Ogiers are also very great keepers of knowledge and as the average Ogier
lives till about 600 years they collect a lot of books and knowledge and
consider humans hasty.
   The Ogier guild is run by Alar and Olgar( both of whom are cool). To
become an ogier your character must be above level 20 and be a keen role
player.  An ogier is a peacful character and therefore does not fight.
A preference for having read up too book 4 would be good but apply even
if you havent and prove your self worthy.  Joining the ogier guild means
not only becoming a huge (very strong) non magic using character it also
means you gain great guild gods and the oppurtunity to train to be our
next Famous treesinger.

               \c07Mail Olgar or Alar your applications\c00

"ONE POWER"

  The One Power (OP in short) is the "magic" in the world of the Wheel
of Time, and also the magic system in Dragons Fang.
  One Power, also called the True Source (not to be confused with the True
Power, which is used only by the highest Darkfriends and some Forsaken), is
made of Saidar (the female part) and Saidin (the male part, which has been
tainted by the Dark One). The One Power is wielded by 'grasping' (for women
it is 'embracing' as well, since Saidar is wielded by surrendering to it and
Saidin is wielded by wrestling with it.) (grasping is the equivalent of
holding magic).
  The One Power is made of five parts - or flows as they are called
(Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit and Water). These five flows are 'woven' (the
equivalent of casting in the WoT world) into different patterns and 'weaves'
(the WoT equivalent of spells) By blending these five flows differently,
you get different results; Spirit  has much to do with living things, Air
manipulates the air and light, Earth deals with things that move the earth,
and so on.
  The more you have in each flow, the more spells (here called weaves) you
can gain and use. A list of what preconditions there are for the spells can
be seen by typing "spells".
Also, spell damage rates are related to how strong you are compared to
the prerequisites: If you have twice the requirements to gain the spell,
your damage/effect is doubled! In some spells, this isn't applicable,
and the flow/prerec ratio isn't affecting anything.
  You raise your ability in each weave by spending Trains, which
you get each time you gain a level. The cost is 1 Train to raise one flow 
one step.
  Each weave needs to be bought, varying between costing 1train up to 8
trains or so (you gain trains when you level, as you do practices.. 10pracs
= 1 train). Then each weave can be practised at the trainer up to a max
of
70%, beyond which it can gain only from use. There are also special weaves,
in addition to special skills, which you gain if you are in a guild.

OOC CHANNELS IC SHOUT
  OOC is the Out Of Character channel. All comments here are to remain as
such, just as the IC channel shall remain In Character _only_. Both channels
can be turned off and turned on again by typing NOOOC and NOIC, respectively.
  The SHOUT channel works within a specific area (people across the world
cannot hear you!) and is considered IC and shall remain so.
  This does not, however, mean you may spam any channel at all times. There
are limits to spamming :) If an IMM tell you to stop, please do.

ORIGIN ORIGINS

There are many places from which a person in the Wheel of Time may come,
and in Dragon's Fang the following origins are available to you:

Three-fold land, Almoth, Amadicia, Andor,Arad Doman, Borderlands, Cairhien,
Illian, Murandy, Seanchan, Tarabon, Tar Valon, Tear, Tremalking and Two Rivers.

The origins give some modifiers to the original stats (Strength,
Constitution etc) but no bonuses. The predefined origin is now Three-fold
land. For the Three-Fold land and Two Rivers there are special guilds that
those coming from there may join, but there is no restriction as such to
what guild someone coming from any particular origin may join.

PKILLS PSTEALING

Pkills and Pstealing, means the killing of, or stealing from, another
player. Since the Dragons Fang is basically a Roleplaying-MUD, these
actions will be frowned upon, unless they are an outcom of RP. Simply
to state that "I killed those smegheads because I'm a Darkfriend."
won't make your life easier.

Although Pstealing is annoying (well, think about it, some schmuck steals
all your hardearned gold)) it's not nearly as annoying as being Pkilled,
mostly because you lose as much XP when killed by a player, that you do
when killed by a mob. So, if you wanna pkill, remember the golden rule,
"Don't do anything to people, you don't want people to do to you."

        Player Killing      Player Fighting.
        --------------      ----------------
     Player Killing (also known as PK) is allowed in the Dragon's Fang,
        and it is also IC, which would mean that the winner of any combat
        session with another player gets to choose what happened (i.e.
        if the loser was killed, or captured, etc).
     BUT both parties have to agree that a Player Fight is going to take
        place if one is to happen legally. You may -not- attack a player
        without emotes (i.e. backstabbing or throwing a fireball) unless
        that player has agreed that a PFight should take place.
     What may count as Player Killing is anything that a player might find
        unpleasant and is not done entirely in emotes. While that includes
        direct damaging attacks (ones that take hit points and can kill),
        it also includes restricting actions (gag, wrap, etc).
     The consequences of an illegal PK may be severe, and are up to the
        judgement of the individual Immortal who has noticed or has been
        asked to interfere in the aftermath of the PK. It may be as light
        as a warning, or it can become loss of levels, deguilding, even
        deletion.
     If you are uncertain about something, please contact any of the Imms
        who will explain this in detail and answer questions. If you
        dispute a ruling made by an Immortal on a PK, you may bring it up
        in an Imm meeting for it to be resolved once and for all.
     Also, if you are player killed ICly but do not think the ICness of it
        is valid, you can dispute the claim to a Council imm. Between the
        time of the kill and the time the decision is made, you should not
        roleplay, as your character might or might not be dead. Any renaming
        or removing of skills and eq will wait until after the decision.
\c01See also:\c07 RP ROLEPLAYING\c00
#
QUESTS QUESTPOINTS QUESTITEMS

  In Dragons Fang, the immortals sometimes arrange Quests, a much appreciated
diversion from the ordinary hack 'n slash or roleplay. The goal of these
quests can be to find certain items (given certain clues), defeat an
onslaught of Shadowspawn or a Trivia in which you get Quest Points (QP) for
your knowledge of the Wheel of Time, among other goals that vary depending
on the type of Quest the IMM is giving.
  Depending on how well you do this, you may get different amounts of QP,
and with these you can buy Questskills (very powerful skills that
enhances your character a lot), Questitems (items with boosted stats, some
of them better than any other on the mud) or perhaps convert them into
Trains and Power Points (at trainers throughout the game).
  Harassing IMMs for quests will not only NOT get you a quest, but can
further irritate them, so don't do it please, through tells or on channels.
#
RACES

When creating your character, you will have a choise of races, or rather
your origin. One thing about races, is the fact that they're starting out
different stats, i.e. a Borderlander might have a bonus on strength, a
Cairhienin might have it on Intelligence. In the long run, this doesn't
really matter, since all races has max abilites of 30, whisch you can gain
by devoting some Trains on them. So why bother choosing a race anyway?

Well, first of all, if you're gonna play a Soldier, a race that gives a
higher Strength and Constitution might be a better choise, since then you
don't have to spend as much of your precious initial trains on those stats.

Secondly, with the HOME command, you will be transfered to the zone that
corresponds with your chosen race, I.e an Aiel might be transferd to
Rhuidean, a Seanchan will be transferd to Seandar. Sometimes, this might
be a good reason to be picky with your choise of race.

RBSEDAI REBELSEDAI REBELS
  The Rebel Sedai have fled the White Tower and Elaida (the current Amyrlin
of the White Tower). The coup was a reactionary act, supported by many
Aes Sedai for fear of a new and different Tower.
  It was feared that Siuan with her support of Rand would make the tower a
secondary, subject power in the world.  It was feared that the Tower would
have to diminish its influence, and change it s policies.
  The Rebel Aes Sedai gathered in Salidar have this fear, the reason they
opposed Elaida and the White Tower was that they viewed her coming to power
as unmoral and unjust. Even though they have a more open view of the Tower's
roles, its not that much different from Elaida's. Due to this split, there
was a lack of a Red Ajah in Salidar (Elaida had been a Red) and a lack of a
Blue Ajah in the White Tower (both Suian and Moiraine, engineers of Rand's
rise to become the Dragon Reborn, had been Blue).
  The Rebel Sedai are also gathering forces to return to the White Tower and
replace Elaida's claim to the Amyrlin Seat.

RP ROLEPLAYING

  Dragon's Fang is a roleplaying MUD, set in the world of Robert Jordan's
wonderful bookseries "The Wheel of Time". We still do allow hack'n'slash
though, but we wish it mostly to be a complement to RP, not a substitute.
Becuse of our direction towards the WoT-series, we want people to choose
names that fit into the WoT-realms.

  This means, no characters named Tjoflojt, Killer, MasterBlaster, Terminator
SlaskTratt or similar. Also, even if the name might fit, don't choose to
wellknown names from other bookseries. For instance, Gandalf, Sauron, Saruman
Raistlin etc might be good names, they're too wellknown to be really good
names.

But, the main question remains, what the bl**dy `ell is roleplaying?

 A hard question to answer, since propably all people invovled in
roleplaying has different definitions. But roughly, you could say
that you make a character, give him a name, and try to think out a
so called 'background-story' for your character. Both name and story
should fit into the WoT-world. Now you log onto the game with your
character, and try to play him accordingly to how you figured your
character should behave in different situations. (Almost like acting).
So, all you have to do now, is to play your character, along with
other ppl from all the corners of the world, and try to have a really
good time. Only one thing is required: \c07creativity!\c00

One important hint though:

Do not use 'impossible' knowledge in your RP. For instance, if you see a
character in the city named Demandred, this is so called OOC-information.
You might now this player is a Forsaken, but your character won`t!

And perhaps the most important at all. Every player you meet on DF, will be
here to have fun, to RP in the WoT-world. So you should live by the golden
rule. Don't do anything towards others, you don't want others to do to you.

RPEXP ROLEPLAYING EXPERIENCE
   
   Every character on Dragon's Fang can gain levels and increase their
power by leveling; this is usually done by killing mobs and being
awarded for it, but now there is another way to achieve that:
   When you Role Play in a room with someone else, you will start
receiving Experience Points for it - more as you continue, encouraging
long sessions over short ones. You and your partner(s) have to be IC at 
the time, and some following of good Rp etiquette will even grant you
better results - for example, if you have a doing for yourself.

#
RWARDER
  A warder is a person who has dedicated his whole life to defend the
Aes Sedai, the "Servants of all", directly translated. They have a
society a bit apart from the Aes Sedai. They are renowned fighters of
considerable skill, and many are Blademasters.
  The warder gets bonded, should he be good enough, and that means that the
Sedai creates a magical attachment between them both, making them both aware
of what mental and physical state the other part is and also if she/he's
injured.
  Rebel Warders are those warders who went with the Blue Ajah when Siuan
Sanche was denounced and stilled.

To join the Warder Guild, you have to meet the following requirements:

Class: Any but Channeler and Wilder
Level: 20+ (May vary depending on how many seeks them out)
_Cannot_ channel. That's the Sedai's job. *whap*

RWARDER_RANKS

Student
----------------------
When a man, or boy joins the Tower in hopes of becoming a Warder,
he must first become a Student. In this short period of time he
must show his knowledge in the blade and in other things that would
be desired from a Sedai. Once a Student makes the oath to become
a Trainee, he can never turn back.

Trainee
----------------------
When a man goes through the student stage and passes, he becomes a
trainee. This starts his life in the ways of the Warder. Trainee is the
harshest time for a Warder, and since the Tower has been Broken
moer Warders are needed. If a Trainee passes his Training he becomes
part of the Tower Guard.

Tested
-------------------------
A Trainee who in terms in no longer a Trainee. He has proven himself to
his Instuctors and has stabilized his standing within the Guild. He
has gained the Cloak, but not been Bonded. This Rank is either a Life
Long rank or a waiting period to becoming bonded.


Warder
----------------------------
A Warder is a Trainee who has finally gained the Cloak, and has become
Bonded.
Some warders have gone straight from Trainee to Bonded, but most
Warders were part of the Tower Guard at some point. This is the most common
rank in the Guild.

Instructor
-----------------------------
An Instructor is a Warder, who knows the forms and the ways of battle.
He also knows the ways of tracking and in short the most effiecient
ways to protect and keep the Sedai safe. They are the best Warders,
and teach the other on how to improve themselves.

Gaidin
-----------------------------
Gaidin is a basic honor Rank. These are Instructors who either
have been promoted through constant ability, or that Warder who would
be an Instructor but is constantly out in the World with his Sedai.
A Gaidin is supposed to be the same Ranking as an Instructor but it
has been known that some Gaidin have even respect from a
Master of Trainees.

Master of Trainees
-----------------------------
There can only be 1 to 3 Master of Trainees at once. These Warders
are Instructors who are the recruiters, and the Trainers of the Students and
Trainees. Only The highest devoted and respected Warder ever attains
such a Rank.

SEANCHAN

From the Glossary in the books;
(1) Descendants of  the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the Aryth Ocean,
who conquered the lands there.  They Believe that any woman who can
channel must be controlled for the safety of everyone else, and any man
who can channel must be killed for the same reason. (2) The land from
which the Seanchan come.

The capital of this land is Seandar, where the Empress sits on the Crystal
Throne, in the Court of the Nine Moons.

The ruler of the Seanchan Empire is the Empress of the Nine Moons, and the
symbol of the Imperial family is the Tower of Ravens.  She supposedly has
the most direct blood link to the High King, Artur Hawkwing.  The greatest
honor someone can receive is to look at the Empress's face.  Her son
Serkralin oversees the Hailene.   The Empress is all powerfull, she is
feared and respected, her word is law.  Serkralin is her vessel to the
Hailene, therefore his word is her word.

Some time ago the Seanchan attempted to reclaim the land they claim was
theirs in the name of the High King.  The attack on Falme was turned back
when Rand Al'thor used the Horn Of Valere to call the heroes.  Rumors of
an army of Aes Sedai aided soldiers has since swept all the way to the
Dragonwall.  Though few know the true story of what happened at Falme, the
Seanchan have fallen back to a few islands in the Aryth Ocean, and prepare
for another strike.

SEANCHAN_REQUIREMENTS

  As for all the others guilds, you need to be level 20 to be guilded.
Then, you need to contact Serkralin or Se'brakne, the guild leaders. The
Seanchan guild is different from the others guilds on the mud, in that  we
are a race, not only a guild. It is always better if you choose the
Seanchan race at creation, to be able to use the home command and recall
to the home room in Seandar.  You can level there up to level 20 as a
Seanchan.  But then, you are not part of the Army until you can be
guilded.

\c01See also:\c07 SEANCHAN, SEANCHANRANKS\c00

SEEKER

  Seekers are property of the Empresses family, like the
Deathwatch Guards.  They are the  police/spy organization with wide
powers.  Even one of the Blood can be arrested for failure to answer any
questions put by a Seeker, or failure to cooperate fully with a Seeker.
To flee from the Seekers mean death.  Only the Empress can change their
decision. To anger or to insult a Seeker is the same as if you anger or
insult the Empress herself.  They have tattoos to identify themselves,
also like the Deathwatch, but they hardly  ever let them be seen.  The
Seekers carry with them a coin marked with the Raven Tower, and they are
the only ones allowed to carry such a coin.

Listeners

Listeners are both higher and lower than the Seekers.  There are two types
of Listeners; there are the Listeners who work within the Raven Tower
hearing confessions and the like, much like the Inquisitors at the
Fortress of Light.  But, there are also listeners who are employed by the
Seekers and the Raven Tower to spy within the houses.  No one but the
Seekers and the Raven Tower knows who these Listeners are.  These
Listeners could be anyone, from a slave to a So'jhin that has been with
the family for generations.

SHOPS SHOPKEEPERS

 Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

 To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop
by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers
are often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed,
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end. Not
only that, killing or stealing from shopkeepers is considered \c02CHEATING\c00
and will not be tolerated by IMMortals. At All.

#
SKILLS

Depending on what class you have chosen, you can gain and train certain
skills (to see what skills are available to you, type "skills").
These skills are bought with Trains and trained with Practices, both
which you get when you increase in levels.
These skills can only be bought and trained at certain places where there
are trainer mobs, which are placed at certain spots throughout the mud.

#
SOLDIER

  The soldier is the backbone of the forces of the Hailene.  Without this
very basic unit nothing would ever be accomplished.  There are a few ranks
within the aims of a soldier, these are; Soldier, the beginning unit; the
Leutenant, a commanding officer; the Captain, a slightly higher rank; and
the Grolm Rider, a special rank, the Grolm Riders are the Elite forces of
the Seanchan army.

SPEARMASTERY BLADEMASTERY

Usage: Automatic

This questskill kicks in automatically once a fight begins.
It gives you +30 hitroll, +30 damroll and -10 AC.

#
STATS

  The stats you have (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, Hitpoints, Movement points, Mana points, the five flows)
are not set in stone. You can increase those if you have Trains, and this
is how you do it:
  Increasing Str, Con, Dex, Int, Wis, Cha, Hit, Move or Mana and the five
flows can be done at the proper trainer, which can be found at several
places.
  Just type the name of the stat, and if it is anything but the five flows
and you have Trains enough, you increase it by 1 (for Str, Con,
Dex, Int, Wis and Cha) or 10 (for Move, Mana and HP).

  Raising Move, Mana or Hp by 10 always costs 1 Train, the other stats cost
more the higher they are (1 per step up to 18, 2 up to 25, 3 up to 30).
Be careful not to use all the Trains for stats, they are used to buy
skills and spells as well.

The five flows (Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit and Water) cost Trains to 
raise as well, one to increase one of them by one step.

You gain Pracs and Trains when you reach a new level.

#
SUL'DAM

  In the Old Tongue, "leash holder."  These women wear the bracelet of the
a'dam and control the Damanes.  To be able to be a Sul'dam, a woman needs
to be able to be taught to channel, but without having the spark (with the
spark she would be marath'damane and would be made Damane). (note:  It is
not known to all that a Sul'dam must be able to, and eventually learn to
channel, if that were known to all it would be disastrous.)  Though they
can learn to channel, most sul'dam don't realize that they can.  They are
the one who collar the marath'damanes,  girls born with the spark.  They
control them and use them to serve the High Noble of their House, or the
Empress herself.  They are like the Soldiers, in rank, but they are most
feared and earned respect and a higher status among the Seanchan.  There
is always more Sul'dams than Damanes.  Sul'dams can only be raised to the
So'jhin rank.

A'DAM

  Device created by the Seanchan.  It is a ter'angreal:  a collar and
bracelet linked together by a leash, all of silver.  A woman who can be
taught to channel wear the bracelet and control the woman born with the
spark and wears the collar.  It creates a link between the two women.
When complete, the Sul'dam know what the Damane is doing with the Power.
The Damane can not channel without the Sul'dam permission or she will get
sick. The more Power she will draw without permission, the sicker she will
become.
  Both women are aware of the other's feeling, like anger, fear
and, sadness, although the Sul'dam can control what feelings are shared
through the leash.  The Sul'dam can make the Damane feel things through
the a'dam, like pain or pleasure. The Damane can not touch any weapon, nor
anything she think of as a weapon, or she will get sick.  The Damane can
not move the bracelet of the a'dam when no Sul'dam wears it.  The farther
she will try to move it, the sicker she will become, until unconsciousness.
  When a Damane and a Sul'dam are joined, whatever the Sul'dam feels, the
Damane feels ten times over, even to death.  It is why a Damane may never
strike at her Sul'dam, but she must protect her even more than herself.
If the leash of the a'dam is broken when a Damane and a Sul'dam wear the
a'dam, they die.  If a man who can channel touches the a'dam, both women
suffer, as if shocked, from the touch.  If a man who channels wears the
a'dam, he will die and so will the sul'dam if any, the listeners in the
Raven Tower use the A'dam as a questioning tactic, and torture.  A'dams
do not work on women that can not channel.


MARATH'DAMANE

In the Old Tongue, "those who must be leashed."  The name given to a girl
born with the ability to channel (spark). The Seanchan think that every
woman who can channel must be collared and controlled for the safety of
everyone else. The Aes Sedai are considered Marath'Damane by the Seanchan,
since they can channel, but they have not been safely collared yet.  Each
year, in every village of Seanchan, the Sul'dams go and test every girls
with the A'dams, trying to find more Damanes
and Sul'dams.  There is then a big festival, and the event of testing is
very well seen by the citizens.  The girls with the spark are collared and
made Damanes, brought along with the girls that can be taught to channel
and made Sul'dams.



DAMANE

In the Old Tongue, "leashed-one."  The girls born with the ability to
channel.  They are like dogs, controlled by a sul'dam with the a'dam.
They are used as weapons, using the One Power in battles.  Depending of
the talents of the Damanes, they can be trained to find precious
minerals for the Seanchan, to make A'dams, or any other tasks that can be
executed only with the One Power.  To be touched by a Damane is a
dishonor, except for the Sul'dams.  They are feared because of their
power, but beside that, they are seen as less than human by the Seanchan.
The Damanes are the property of the Empress.  They can not do anything
without the Sul'dam's permission.  They possess nothing.  Damanes are
possessions.  Most Damanes are not allowed names.

#
TER'ANGREAL

Ter'angreals are as San'greals and Angreals, items of the One Power.
But, Ter'angreals doesn't increase the ammount of the One Power you
can channel. Instead, they're designed to use the One Power in a
special way. Examples of this are the stone ringg Egwene is given by
Verin to access Tel'aran'rhiod, or the balefire-producing rod stolen
by the Black Ajah.

Not as rare as *greals, Ter'angreals are still not very common, and
the White Tower will surely lay claim on it.

"TOWER SEDAI"
Tower Aes Sedai Guild
=====================
     The Tower Aes Sedai guild is a roleplay guild, and hence, roleplay is
greatly emphasised within the guild.  Only the best roleplayers will be added
to the ranks of this guild.  If you are lucky enough to become a member of
the guild, you will most likely start as a Novice.  The basic rankings
most members will see are Novice, Accepted and Aes Sedai.  Those few who
are elected by their Ajahs may become Sitters in the Hall of the Tower,
or even Leader of their Ajah.  The Tower Aes Sedai guild also has places
for Protectorates (those who seek the Protection of the Tower, but either
do not channel, or do not wish to become Aes Sedai), and Prisoners (those
who the Tower takes as Prisoner for a period of time, for some
reason).
        A Novice's life is one of chores, learning, meekness,
duty and strictrules.  A Novice never speaks to an Aes Sedai, unless
spoken to first, and obeys an Aes Sedai's word without question (failing
to do so usually gets a sharp lecture from the Aes Sedai, which is all in
the spirit of roleplay!).  Novices are given instruction by Accepted and
Aes Sedai.  They are taught the basics of using the One Power; how to
grasp and release, identifying each of the five flows and how to weave
each of the five flows.  Novices are restricted to the White Tower, and
may not even enter the city of Tar Valon without an Aes Sedai's
permission as well as an escort (be it a Warder or an Aes Sedai).
***It is worth noting at this point that for rp purposes, a Novice may go
anywhere on the mud icly, so as not to restrict rp, BUT, if caught by a
Warder or an Aes Sedai, such a Novice should *expect* to be *severely*
punished, icly (ie, switchings, extra chores, or anything else an Aes
Sedai or the Amyrlin can think of!).When a Novice is deemed to have
suitable control of the One Power, and able to recognise the flows, weave
them to a certain aptitude and has the correct attitude, she is raised to
the Accepted.
        An Accepted's life is somewhat less confined by
rules than a Novice's, and they are allowed to choose their own areas of
study, within limits.  They also may not leave the White Tower without the
permission of an Aes Sedai as well as an escort (be it a Warder, Student,
Trainee or Aes Sedai).  An Accepted may speak to an Aes Sedai without
being spoken to first, but should always be respectful and meek (else face
rebuke by the Aes Sedai if she takes offence to the Accepted's tone!).
When an Accepted is deemed to have reached a suitable level of control,
knowledge, strength and skill in the One Power (and attitude) she is
raised to the Shawl.  Part of what an Accepted learns entails learning how
to weave complex weaves with the One Power, how to tieoff weaves and
flows, history, and this on top of their chosen areas of study.
       When an Accepted is raised to the Shawl, she becomes Aes Sedai
and chooses her Ajah.  There are seven Ajahs:  the Red, the White, the Green,
the Grey, the Brown, the Yellow and the Blue, however only the first six
are present within the Tower Aes Sedai.  If you wish to become Blue Ajah,
best to seek out those darn Rebels! *grin*  An Aes Sedai may do as she
pleases, as long as it does not break Tower Law.  The Ajah an Aes Sedai
chooses tends to dictate what her actions will be as Aes Sedai, and to
what she will lend her energies for the course of her life.  Type help
ajah to learn about the Ajahs.
        A Sitter is an Aes Sedai who has been raised by her Ajah to the
Hall of the Tower - an esteemed position among Aes Sedai.
The Hall consists ofthree Sitters from each Ajah (all but the Blue in t
he case of the Tower AesSedai).  While the Amyrlin Seat
is by law the absolute power in the White Tower, in fact her power has
always depended on how well she could lead, manage or intimidate the Hall,
as there are many ways that the Hall can balk any Amyrlin's plans.  Thus,
a Sitter is an Aes Sedai who helps govern the White Tower, under the
Amyrlin and Keeper, and who holds some sway among allAes Sedai.  Because
of this, Sitters are normally accorded a tad more respect over 'normal'
Aes Sedai (though not so much that they are revered).
        Ajah Leaders are those Aes Sedai that are elected by their Ajah
to lead that Ajah.  For each Ajah there is only one Ajah Leader, elected
by a majority vote (and
incidentally they can be removed by a majority vote among the Ajah).
Within the Ajah, an Ajah Leader's word is as equal to the Amyrlin's;
outside of the Ajah, an Ajah Leader's word is simply that of another Aes
Sedai's.  Normally, no one outside of an Ajah will know that Ajah's
Leader, and normally the members of an Ajah will give the Leader a title
to show she is of some importance.
        Protectorates are people who seek the protection of the
Tower for atime.  They are usually not permanent members, and thus can
make for some interesting roleplay.
Protectorates usually do not channel (if they do, they may well find
themselves bullied into becoming a Novice).  The Tower will offer
protection to nearly anyone in need of it (oocly, you must clear
this Elaida first, probably best done through a mudmail stating your
intentions, and roleplay with other Aes Sedai, or Elaida herself - though
it may not be easy to get to see Elaida icly *wink*).
        Prisoners are those people Aes Sedai deem necessary to hold within
the walls of the White Tower for a period of time.  Again, this should be
cleared with Elaida beforehand via a mudmail stating your intentions and why
you want to be taken prisoner.  In the case of belonging to another guild,
please check with your guildleader *before* mailing Elaida or beginning rp
which may lead to you being taken prisoner.  Of course, Prisoners do not
*have* to be added to the guild - it may simply be rp'd the whole way, if
you wish.
        On the whole, however, the Tower Aes Sedai guild exists
for roleplay.We do not encourage levelling, though we do not restrict
it.  We *do* preferour members to roleplay, however, and thus try to
create the best atmospherefor roleplaying.  Within the Tower, if you do
not agree with something icly,then try to change it, icly, by roleplaying
(this could be anything, fromsomething an Aes Sedai is doing, or
something the Hall is considering, tosomething the Amyrlin is doing!).
If you love roleplay, then roleplay now fora position among the Tower Aes
Sedai - but read the requirements first!

#
"TOWER REQ"
Tower Aes Sedai Requirements
============================
        There are a few requirements you must meet before you can attempt to
gain a position within the Shining Walls of Tar Valon.  These are:
       *** Be female (yes, we are a sexist guild *wink*)
           The reason behind being female is that any male who channels the
           One Power eventually goes mad from the taint.

       *** Be level 20 or over

       *** Be able to roleplay well

       *** Have some basic knowledge of the Wheel of Time world
           There is no requirement on you to have read a specific number of
           the Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan, or even any, but it is
           recommended you try to do so.  Without a good knowledge of the
           WoT world, and the concepts of the WoT theme, it will be hard for
           you to roleplay as an Aes Sedai, as there are many underlying
           concepts presented in Rober Jordan's books that set the
           foundations behind the Tower Aes Sedai guild.

        *** Be a channeler, wilder, or a sparked character
            Channeler or wilder are classes that can be selected at creation.
            A sparked character means you did not select channeler or wilder
            at creation, but you have been 'born' with the spark in you, and
            can channel anyway!
Now, if you meet all these requirements, you must seek out members of the
Tower Aes Sedai guild and roleplay with them.  If you are finding it very
hard to find any, feel free to send a mudmail to Elaida or give her a tell;
she can then point you in the right direction, or point some Aes Sedai
at you.When you find an Aes Sedai, you should try and roleplay with her in
such away as to let her know you are seeking the Tower Aes Sedai guild.
She willbe able to tell if you channel or not, and will roleplay with you.
Be aware though, that she may not reveal herself as being Aes Sedai right away,
since there are some enemies for Aes Sedai.  Once you have roleplayed with an
Aes Sedai or two (or three, or as many as you can/like), she will notify
Elaida and other Aes Sedai.  If you are successful in grabbing their
attention, you will probably be brought to Tar Valon, where you will gain
an audience with the Amyrlin.  Remember, roleplay is the key to success
within the Tower Aes Sedai guild!

#
TOWERAJAH AJAH

The Aes Sedai Ajahs
===================
        There are seven Ajahs among the Aes Sedai, which are similar to
societies, designated by colour.  All Aes Sedai but the Amyrlin Seat belong
to one, and each follows a specific philosophy of th euse of the One Power,
and the purposes of Aes Sedai.  The definitions of these Ajahs is as follows:
     The \c01Red\c00 Ajah -- bends its energies to finding men who can channel,
                     and to gentling them (cutting them off from the One                       Power forever).  They see this as the only way to
                     prevent another Breaking of the World.  Reds usually
                     dislike or hate men and hence do not bond Warders.
     The \c10Brown\c00 Ajah -- forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to
                     seeking knowledge, lost artifacts and books.  They
                     try to rediscover the knowledge lost during the
                     Breaking, the Trolloc Wars and other catastrophes
                     of the world.  Browns are usually quite dreamy and
                     tend to suffer from a short attention span.  They
                     believe in bonding only one Warder at a time.
     The \c07White\c00 Ajah -- eschews the world and the value of worldly
                     knowledge, devoting itself to questions of truth and
                     philosophy.  Whites tend to be cold, calm, logical,
                     aloof and stoic.  They bond only one Warder at a
                     time.
     The \c02Green\c00 Ajah -- holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai'don (the Last
                     Battle).  Often called the Battle Ajah, the Green
                     Ajah fought alongside armies during the Trolloc
                     Wars.  They tend to love men and bond many Warders.
     The \c14Grey\c00 Ajah -- devotes itself to mediation, seeking harmony and
                     consensus among all things. They tend to negotiate
                     between nations and the White Tower, and they bond
                     only one Warder at a time.
     The \c03Yellow\c00 Ajah -- are Healers.  Yellows bend their energies to the
                     study of Healing, and tend to be the best among all
                     Aes Sedai.  They constantly try to find new ways to
                     Heal things, and bond only one Warder at a time.
     The\c04 Blue\c00 Ajah -- involves itself with causes and justice.  Blue
                     sisters are sometimes single-minded, and will often
                     meddle in the affairs of nations.  They bond only one
                     Warder at a time.
Among the Tower Aes Sedai there are currently no Blue sisters, as
all of them fled to Salidar when Siuan Sanche was deposed and Stilled.
Among the Salidar Aes Sedai there are currently no Red sisters, as none
fled with the rebels.

"TOWER WARDER" GAIDIN

WARDER: (1)In the Old Tongue, "Gaidin", which means "Brother to Battles".
A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai.  The bonding is a thing of the One Power:
By it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods
without food, water, or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark
One at a distance.  So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is
bonded knows he is alive, however far away he is, and when he dies she will
know the moment and manner of his death.  The bonding seems weaker at a
distance, and the Warder knows precisely in what direction his Sedai lies in
relation to him.
While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a
time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, and the Green Ajah
believes an Aes Sedai may bond as many as she wishes.  Ethically, the Warder
must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to be done
against the Warder's will.
What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is a closely held secret.

"TOWER WARDER GUILD" TW

The title Warder is known far and wide throughout the world.  Heroes of
legend, villains, shadowy figures about which little is known, most anything
can be heard to be ascribed to a Warder.
To join the Warder Guild, one must have a sponsor.  To gain a sponsor, you
should make an effort to seek out a Warder, or a Tested, and RP with them.
If they are impressed with your loyalty and bravery, they may bring you to
meet the Master at Arms, of whichever Tower you seek to join.  An interview
will be conducted, and, if after that you wish to swear allegiance, and the
Master At Arms is willing to accept you, you will begin your training.

TP "TRUE POWER"

The True Power
  Bestowed only by the blessing of the Dark One, this tremendous
source of power, is given only to Shai'tan's most trusted servants.
Being a weapon which cuts both ways, this power is drawn directly
from the Great Lord, rather than Saidin or Saidir. Its advantages
allow the wielder to use this dark energy independent of the One
Power, still being able to channel the horrific blessing even if
the wielder is severed from Saidin or Saidir. Besides being
extremely lethal, the True Power extracts a price from the
wielder as well, driving him or her to madness and death, much as
the taint on Saidin. The Saa, black dots that appear in one's
eyes, is the only known physical indicator of oncoming insanity.

TWRP

  This section is intended as a guide to what(general) views are held toward
various other groups.  Individual RP can (and is expected to), supersede
these guidelines, but they should be used when possible, for good RP.
Because you are working closely with a Sedai in most cases, your RP enjoyment
can be both enhanced and more difficult.  Try to bond with a Sedai who you
have come to know, and whom you can work with.
Suggested Attitudes toward other guilds:

\c07Aes Sedai:\c00
   As a Warder, you exist to protect Sedai.  One Sedai in particular,
   but all in principle.  Their goals and needs are yours.  Respect and
   loyalty are to be shown to all Sedai.

\c07Aiel:\c00
   Warriors of the Aiel Waste, these men and women are awesome fighters,
   and are to be shown the greatest of respect, within reason.  They are
   not your enemies, so you should not seek battle with them unless no
   other choice remains.

\c07Army of the Rebel Tower:\c00
   A small army led by Gareth Bryne to protect the Rebel Amyrlin Seat,
   Egwene al'Vere. Their loyalties are toward the Rebels, and they
   would not hesitate to attack the Tower.. be watchful of them, they
   are not your enemy, but could be dangerous.

\c07Asha'man:\c00
   Channeling men harbored by Rand Al'Thor.  They learn not only to use
   the One Power in combat, but to use the sword, as well.  It is yet
   unclear how well any of them have learned this skill.  Consider them
   dangerous, and keep your Sedai clear of them.

\c07Band of the Red Hand:\c00
   A motley collection of mercenaries following the lead of Matrim Cauthon,
   they are not to be trusted, as they have little love for Sedai. While
   not enemies, neither are they friends.

\c07Children of the Light:\c00
   'Whitecloaks'. These zealots are to be avoided whenever possible,
   otherwise they should be considered extremely dangerous.  Your Sedai
   is in great danger from these men, who travel in large groups.  Even
   a blademaster can be overwhelmed.  Do not overestimate yourself.

\c07Darkfriends:\c00
   Pawns of the Dark One.  Evil men and women who, if discovered, should
   be destroyed, if the action does not endanger your Sedai, or your
   ability to Ward her.  Do not allow these evil souls to place you or
   your Sedai in a position where pressure can be placed upon you for
   their ends.

\c07Forsaken:\c00
   Powerful channelers, shielded from the taint by the power of the Dark One.
   These people are to be avoided at all costs.  Do *not* allow them any
   opportunity to corrupt your Sedai, or to harm her.  Get her away,
   Immediately.

\c07Gleeman:\c00
   Spare a few coppers for them if you see one performing at an inn :)

\c07The Kin:\c00
   You know nothing of them whatsoever, and you would treat them as you
   would other healers and Wisdoms - respectful, but not overly so.

\c07Legion of the Dragon:\c00
   A ragtag army of followers who wish to see Rand Al'Thor placed
   upon the thrones of the world.  Badly organized, badly trained... but
   dangerous in numbers.  Beware overconfidence. (now disbanded).

\c07Ogier:\c00
   These are the famed Builders - who built the walls of the White Tower, as
   well as many other cities that have disappeared since the Breaking. They
   are to be regarded with the utmost respect and honor due to them, since
   they do not appear regularly and are regarded as wiser and more
   knowledgable than the oldest Brown Sedai.

\c07Rebel Warders:\c00
   Our brothers apart.  Treat them with the respect due any Warder. If Sedai
   pits Warder against Warder, we will fight, but until then, we are one,
   although we are separated.

\c07Sea Folk:\c00
   Little is known about the shipfolk.  Consider them dangerous until proven
   otherwise.  It is rumored that some of their men are fine warriors.

\c07Seanchan:\c00
   Based on what information has been gathered, these people are extremely
   dangerous, particularly to Sedai.  No quarter should be asked, or given.

\c07Tuatha'an:\c00
   Tinkers - their colorful garb hurts your eyes, but that is the farthest
   they would go to hurt you. Their way is off peace, and while it is not
   your way, you should respect then at worst, as they would go out of their
   way to welcome you.

\c07Two Rivers People:\c00
   Common folk from the south and west of Andor, these people should be
   judged on their individual merits.  Beware Darkfriends, who may lurk
   hidden amongst them.

"TRUE POWER"

  The True Power (TP) works just as the One Power, with the one teeny weeny
difference that it is connected to the Dark One. It determines who gets
access to TP and who does not. Very few get access to TP, probably only the
Forsaken themselves, but that is never certain.
  When TP is used or grasped, only others who have access to it can see that.
There is of course a terrible setback to using such a power, but who is
there to tell you what?

"TWO RIVERS"
  The Two Rivers guild is a communitity type guild.  Men and women alike can
join.  This guild is headed by Perrin and Faile.
  The people of the Two Rivers are the decendants of ancient Manetheren.
Manetheren was destroyed in the Trolloc Wars.  When it did exist, it was a
thorn in the Dark Ones side.  Now, after hearing the stories, the people
of the Two Rivers wish to become a thorn in the Dark Ones' side once more.
Making Perrin Aybara their lord and he using the help of Tam al'Thor to
train the people in the ways of battle has vowed to drive the Trollocs and
Whitecloaks out of the Two Rivers and prepare the people for Tarmon
Gai'don.  And because of the unrest in the world, many people have fled to
this little place looking for some peace and quiet.  So the Two Rivers has
become home to many people of many races.

TUATHA'AN TINKERS

  Tuatha'an, Tinkers, travelling people...whatever you call them, you can
always recognize them by their bright colors and their way of life, a
peaceful life led by the \c02Way of the Leaf.\c00
  They are a wandering people, skilled at repairing goods, and are one of
the few groups allowed by the Aiel to cross the Aiel waste. The most
important purpose of their life is to search for the song, a song that
was known in the Age of Legends and when found, will bring peace to the
world once more.
  Rumors about the Tuatha'an abound, rumors that they steal anything,
including children, but the reality is that many children, once they have
seen the way of life that the Tuatha'an lead, wish to go with the travellers
and lead a peaceful, relaxed life of wandering about the world in wagons,
searching for the song, telling stories and dancing at what seems almost
like a continuous party. The Tuatha'an do not turn anyone away. Level 20 is
not required.
  On Dragon's Fang, the Tuatha'an have a central camp, which is located
between Altara and Illian, but the members of the Tuatha'an who have reached
a certain rank travel by themselves and in groups throughout the world in
their own personalized wagons, which the Guildleaders make for them. They
can use the money earned from guildskills like repair to buy a horse to ride
and pull their wagon, also made especially for the guild members.
  To join the Tuatha'an, you need to mail a history to Ila and/or Raen,
preferably both of them, and set up a time to RP with them and the other
guild members online to join. Roleplay is extremely important for
advancement in the Tuatha'an. It is preferable if at least books one
and two of the Wheel of Time series have been read as well.

WETLANDERS
  Aiel refer to those that are non-Aiel as wetlanders, and especially the
people who live to the west of the Spine of the World. They regard
wetlanders as one would a child - weak, soft and not intelligent enough
to comprehend the ways of the Aiel (especially Ji'e'Toh, which is never
applied to wetlanders).
  Killing a wetlander would not result in Toh towards the wetlander or his
clan. However, raiding and killing wetlanders merely for the sake of killing
is frowned upon (as were the Shaido, who practiced this after they turned
upon the other clans).
  Taking wetlanders Gai'shain is considered useless, as wetlanders do not
have the capacity for understanding Ji'e'toh, and may result in the
outcasting of the person (or clan, take the Shaido) who does this.

"WAY OF THE LEAF"
  The \c02Way of the Leaf\c00 is a nonviolent way that is the code of the
Tuatha'an people, the Traveling Folk - who would rather run away from danger
than cause violence to someone.
  The Way of the Leaf is simple - as the leaf bends to the will of the wind,
so shall the Tuatha'an. They believe that violence not only causes harm and
injury to the victim, but it also causes harm to the one who is perpetrating
the violence - When you chop down a tree, the tree is harmed by the fall of
the axe, but the axe is also dulled by the bark of the tree.
  \c02"The leaf lives its appointed time, and does not struggle against the
  wind that carries it away.  The Leaf does no harm, and finally falls
  to nourish new leaves.  So it should be with all men.  And women."\c00

WOLFKIN WOLFBROTHERS WK

Some people is born with the ability to talk with wolves. These people
are called Wolkin or Wolfbrothers (at least here on Dragons Fang).
You can't really become a Wolfkin, this is something you are born
with.

Before meeting your kin, you will be unable to do more than hear to
the wolves calling to you; voices will be audible to which you will be
unable to reply. This will last until you gain the golden eyes.

As a wolfkin you will get access to the WolfTalk channel, do not abuse this
it's for RP-purposes only. This is also one of the few, perhaps only, channel
of communication that works if you are gagged. Other good effects from being 
WolfKin is good hearing (implemented as an ability to hear whispered 
conversation in a room) and good sight (implemented as the ability to see in 
most dark rooms without a light).

WOT "\c07WHEEL OF TIME\c00"
  "The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that
  become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten
  when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the
  Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose
  in the Mountains of the Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are
  neither beginnings or endings in the Wheel of Time. But it was _a_
  beginning." - EotW

 The Wheel of Time started thus, a single book published in 1990 by a man
some named Robert Jordan. This book detailed the journey of a small band
of Two River's Folk - their flight from fists of Trollocs and several
Fades, their journey into self-discovery and adventure. Rand al'Thor,
Perrin Aybara, and Matrim Cauthon were the trio that would shake the
world. They were Ta'averen, outside the Pattern of the Wheel of Time,
twisting and bending its threads like spiderwebs in their palms.

  Thus the story of the coming of the Dragon Reborn started - a man so
strong in the One Power as to rival the Dragon (Lews Therin Telamon), a
man so strongly Ta'averen that nations would bend around his will. In the
late third Age, the seven seals which held the Dark One were weakening
and the spread of the Shadow was reaching further and further down from
Shayol Ghul - the weather was hotter than previous years, the agents
of the Dark One spread throughout the Land, False Dragons wrecked havoc
in many nations...
  The Dragon had sealed the Dark One into the Bore at Shayol Ghul, where
he was bound with thirteen Forsaken - the most powerful Aes Sedai from
the Age of Legends. The Dragon had also been blamed for Breaking the
World with the use of tainted Saidin. The legend of the Dragon Reborn
was regarded with the same apprehension and fear - but without the
Dragon Reborn, the world would fall into Shadow when the Dark One stirred.

RPHELP CITIES RPCHAR \c07RPCHARACTERHELP\c00
   In the Wheel of Time, many nationalities of people, and even some
races, coexist. The following is a brief summary of countries and
nationalities to help develop your character:

\c06o\c07Aiel\c00     - Aiel are very tall, normally pale but tanned from the sun,
            have grey, blue or green eyes, and have hair color that
            ranges from red to blonde. Warriors wear cadin'sor in
            natural colors, a shoufa with a black veil attached, and
            use spears and bows. Men are clean shaven, and wear clothes
            in natural shades - soft laced boots, close-fitting coat,
            and breeches in shades of brown and yellow. Young girls
            wear short skirts and braided pigtails. Women wear bulky
            brown skirts, loose white blouses, and brown shawls, and
            usually wear little jewelry unless they are Wise Ones.
            Gai'shain wear only a white robe. It is an Aiel custom to
            never wear rings, as they may hinder fighting or other tasks.

\c06o\c07Altara\c00   - capital is Ebou Dar. People are of medium stature, of
            rather dark complexion. Women wear their hair loose, and
            down to their shoulders or shorter. Pale skirts with
            brightly colored petticoats showing on one side, with lace
            trim are worn by the women. Men have handle-bar mustaches
            and square trimmed beards, and wear dark pants, pleated
            white shirts with loose sleeves and brightly embroidered
            vests. Both sexes wear daggers on themselves and know how
            to defend themselves well. Women of all classes wear a
            marriage dagger around their neck.

\c06o\c07Amadacia\c00 - capital is Amador. The home of the Children of the Light,
            and people are very conservatively dressed, with women
            wearing long, high necked, long sleeved (unrevealing)
            black dresses. Women have dark curled hair and wear bonnets
            to hide their faces. Men wear coats to their knees, unless
            of course, they wear those distinctive white cloaks.

            region to region, with some towns having stripes as a local
            fashion and others scarves worn on the head. Many towns
            regard the braiding of hair as a sign of womanhood,
            especially the regions near the Mountains of the Mist.

\c06o\c07Arad Doman\c00 - capital is Bandar Eban. Women are tall, willowy, and have

            and sometimes have hair reaching below their shoulders.
            Domani dresses are thin, high necked and long, and are
            nearly transparent and cling to everything. Noblewomen
            wear bracelets bearing their house symbols. Men sometimes

            leather vests.

CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS
                    C  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
