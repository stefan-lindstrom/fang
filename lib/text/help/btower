bTOWER ASHA'MAN AM

     Asha'man, the name taken by followers of the Dragon Reborn, men who have 
come to what is now being called the Black Tower in order to learn how to 
channel. Some have dreamed of channeling despite all the dire risks, while 
others remain only because passing the test for the ability to learn has 
itself started them on the road to channeling, and they now must learn to 
control it before it kills them. They train not only in using the One Power, 
but in the use of the sword and in fighting with hands and feet. Unlike Aes 
Sedai, who go to great lengths to make sure that those they train are not 
allowed to move dangerously fast, the Asha'man are pushed hard from the 
beginning, most especially in learning to use the Power as a weapon. It is 
expected that a certain number of Asha'man Soldiers will die or be burned out 
attempting to learn.
