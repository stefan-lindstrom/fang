  In hopes of assisting smaller roleplay plots on the mud, rather than
skipping right to the major stuff then stopping after the massive event, the
following has been implemented.

1) If you wish to run an event, contact your  Guildleader or a Storyteller.
In the case of the latter, it is their job to execute events for your
enjoyment and if you suggest an event to them, they will seriously consider
the idea and run it, or explain why they wouldn't and help you come up with
a better idea or plot.

2) You must have more than three individuals involved in the event. Mail
the names along with the idea to the Storyteller you've chosen to run the
event.

3) Outline what you would like the Storyteller to do in the event.
  What role did you want the Storyteller to play?
  How much authority do you want the Storyteller to have oocly?
  Do you want the Storyteller to run the event, so that you are as surprised
as your companions at the outcome of the rp? Or would you rather have
full control of the event and put the Storyteller in a role of conflict
with your own or a subordinate position to your character for the rp.


  The Storytellers are here to assist in your roleplaying experience.
They are required to run events for your pleasure, but this does not mean
that they will not take quest requests. Please help the Storytellers, come up
with events that will make you have fun at Dragon's Fang.
