    Please choose names for your characters appropriate to the WoT setting
in the books by Robert Jordan, or at least reasonable ones to the
atmosphere and spirit of those. Immortals of the Dragon's Fang may change
your name later if that doesn't happen.

    If you are new to the lands of the Dragon's Fang, you can type "help
basic" and "help faq" to get some really elementary help. You should also
be aware of our current Player Killing rules, so type "help pk" for that.
Ignorance is not an excuse.

    It is a good idea to turn the nospam option on, if you haven't done so
yet. Just type "nospam" for that, and a symmetric and more structured
interface in your combat.
