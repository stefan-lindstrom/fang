                \c13The Omnipotent Immortal Handbook\c00
               \c11*--------------------------------*\c00
  As one of the creators of this mud once said: Be fair, be fair, and
never forget to bring your towel. You must always follow the rules as
honestly as you can. The Rules and Policies are meant to help the mud
stay fair and enjoyable for everyone involved, and to ensure that no
one undermines this single objective. Muds are games that people play
to relax and have a good time. As part of the immortal staff, it is your
job to make sure you do not trip on the wire and shut off the gamewide
enjoyment. Avoid this by using your common sense.
  It must be made extremely clear that your immortal position is a
privilage that can be taken away. To be immed you must already be trusted
not to misuse what you are given, or you would not have this chance.
Everyone makes mistakes. You are allowed countless times to mess up.
However, there is only one abuse. You are trusted to use your commands
wisely and without favoritism. Ignorance of the rules surrounding your
commands and imm-dom is not an excuse. Ask before you act. If you abuse
something, you will be de-immed.

\c10Examples of abuse:\c00
***Note: these are \c14examples\c00. Use your judgement in everything.

\c05*\c00 Reimbursing/Handing out EQ: Giving eq to someone other than your own
guildmember is very wrong. Reimbursements are for when *we* mess up. Only
then. As in if we delete their obj files or purge them instead of a room.
\c14A coding mistake.\c00 Distributing eq and money is not what imms are for.
\c05*\c00 Snooping: With invis and snoop, you have the ability to watch another
player at any time, but you should never do it. It is an invasion of privacy
to snoop in on someone. The only times it is fair to do so are when you watch
guild or quest rp, or when you suspect cheating. And you should \c14always\c00
ask if it is okay to snoop beforehand.
\c05*\c00Statting/Giving Code Info: When do the mortals ever need to know how a
skill's code works, or what the stats of a mob are? We are not an information
service for them to use when needed. Let them experiment and discover for
themselves. This is what skills like appraise are for.

  Nepotism has no place on a mud. Playing favorites is the worst thing that
can happen in a game like this. You may like your guild better than the
others, but you may not give them extra gifts. As an immortal, your goal is
to make the mud balanced and fair for everyone who plays here. Making one
person unfarily stronger than the rest will only increase resentment.
  I once heard the quote: "Masters are usually indistinguishable from the
rest of the people until they are required to express themselves through
their creations." You should strive to make this mud the best. To do that,
you need a respectable, influencing product, be it a guild, area, or some
rp you throw out to the crowd. We want this place to shine. To do it, all
we need is the support and best intentions of everyone involved, which means
working together and making everyone masters of their field.

\c10The Areas and Types of Immortals:\c00
\c09"\c02What exactly am I supposed to do here?\c09"\c00
\c14**\c00All immortals are Newbie Helpers. Never let a bad name go by,
  and take a few minutes to help all new players.

\c01Q\c08u\c10e\c09s\c13t\c11o\c05r\c12:\c00
Your job is to promote roleplay, book knowledge, and excitement. Have
yourself a good time with the mortals, and just follow the Quest Policy.
Also, you are like a Newbie Imm. You should be the first to jump to a bad
name or new player.

\c07B\c14u\c07i\c14ld\c07e\c14r\c07:\c00
Your job is to build the base atmosphere of the mud. You will build what the
Headbuilder agrees to as your project, and finish by deadline. You report to
the HB on all things, and must comply to all building Policies. Do not build
to the benefit of any one type of player or any whim of some other immortal.

\c06Gu\c11il\c06dl\c11ea\c06de\c11r:\c00
Your job is simply to run your Guild. You must play at least 10 hours a
week. The guild is yours. You decide what the ranks and help files are, and
what your eq looks like. The guild zone is yours as well, but any changes
must be okayed by the Headbuilder. You must have no less than \c144\c00 eq for
every single rank in your guild. You should try to have regular guild
meetings. You should run guild quests, with the same rules applying as
normal quests. You should promote roleplay and try to make your guild ICly
respectable. You will not try to have the strongest eq or skills. All new
skills must be agreed upon by the Creator and Weaver imms. Your only focus
is your guild, nothing more. Only you can make the guild fun, full of people
and a presence in the mud.

\c01C\c08ou\c10n\c08ci\c01l\c07:\c00
You uphold the mortal Policy of the mud and deal out punishment to someone
who breaks it. You also mediate problems between people, such as who should
win an rp fight or an immortal who can't stand another. Run a trial for
someone who breaks policy, listening to the excuse and determining if it is
viable. Hear both sides to every case. The most important trait you *need*
is the ability to be \c14objective\c00. The final thing you can do is
formally suggest new Policy. Other immortals may come to you with ideas,
and if you agree to them, write and present them. All Policy changes must
be discussed and agreed on in majority between all Council imms. There
will always be an odd number of Council.

\c03He\c10a\c14db\c10u\c03il\c10d\c14er\c10:\c00
There is only one. You decide all projects and determine who runs the upkeep
of what zones. You interview new Builder hopefuls. You are the head of the
Building spectrum of the mud. You run builder meetings. You may determine
new building Policies. However, these changes must be agreed upon between
you and the Creators.

\c02W\c06e\c09a\c02v\c06e\c09r\c02:\c00
You run the entire Coding spectrum of the mud. You do the changes, bugs,
new commands, etc. You also decide whether new guild skills will be
implemented. You interview new Weaver hopefuls.

\c05C\c12r\c05e\c12a\c05t\c12o\c05r\c12:\c00
You head the People spectrum of the mud. You interview new Questors and
Guildleaders. You immortalize all new additions. You also deimm all who
cheat. You are the only one who can siteban. You are the first to look
over and decide whether new Policies or skills are okay. You physically
change all Policies except Builder. You decide any mud affecting issues,
such as moving or changing from Circle to ROM. You run the immortal and
guild meetings. You are looked to as the Head of the mud, and therefore
must be more \c14objective\c00 than any other.

\c10Did you forget your towel yet?\c00
  This handbook is long because being an immortal is not easy. Once you
get a hang of it and can grasp responsibility, being an immortal is one
of the most enjoyable experiences of mudding. It shows you a whole new
side of the game and at Dragon Fang we want everyone to have a good time,
even the staff that runs the whole thing. If you ever have any trouble
with any other player, bring it up. Try first to talk to that person, or
use a mediator. As a last resort, speak about your problem to a Council
imm or Creator. No one should have to deal with their problems alone. If
we are to be a family, we need to work together, even with the occasional
sibling rivalries.
  Lastly, I want to thank every person that is or ever has been an immortal.
You give this mud its flavor. Your hard work will pay off some day! And
then I want to leave you with a second quote. "Your rank gives you
authority, your behavior earns you respect!" You can derive your own
meaning from it. I feel it represents how I attempt to shape my portion of
the mud. I want to create an environment fit to contain, relax and thrill
everyone equally. I hope you do too.
