\c14Don't forget to read your \c07Handbook!\c00

\c02Please remember to keep gecho spam to a minimum.
And try using \c08refresh \c02instead of \c08restore\c02. It makes
restore seem more of a treat. Also, restrict your usage of \c13trans\c02.
Unless it is for an OOC reason like a preguild interview, don't use it.
We have Taxis, Gate, guildwalk, and more for morts to use on their own.

\c06Snoop is to \c00\c01only\c00\c06 used without mortals' explicit knowledge
and consent if \c00\c01a)\c00\c06 there is suspicion of cheating, or \c00\c01b)\c00\c06
there is suspicion of violation of policy (multiplaying, etc). Do NOT snoop
otherwise.\c00

\c06New commands: \c14guildinv\c06 and \c14clone\c06.
\c00
&BNew fixes :&n
* IMMs can't tell through notell.
* The "lines" command is fixed to approve lengths only from 10-50.
* "Dreampull" is fixed. When you dreampull someone and wake up , the
  one you dreampulled can try to wake with 20% chance each round.

&Ranother fix for the questors :&n
You can now use switch. The switched mobs won't move , attack or
anything while you are inside them. You can also use IMM commands
while inside a mob , but only IMM commands of level Immortal.

\c01Q\c08u\c10e\c09s\c11t\c06o\c13r\c05s \c00and all imms who run \c12Quests!\c00
Due to the fact that the position of Head Questor proved to not be
necessary, we will go back to our usual ranks. Anyone who runs a Quest
must mail \c09Sorilea\c00 a quick report. This is especially important for
Questors; if I do not get at least 2 mails from each of you a week,
after 3 weeks I will deimm you for not doing your job.

\c01NOTE \c00the clarifications of Nobility setting on imm board and help files.
