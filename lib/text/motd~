    Please choose names for your characters appropriate to the WoT setting
in the books by Robert Jordan, or at least reasonable ones to the
atmosphere and spirit of those. Immortals of the Dragon's Fang may change
your name later if that doesn't happen.

\c14**  \c00Multiplaying (logging on more than one character on at a time) is -not-
allowed.

    If you are new to the lands of the Dragon's Fang, you can type "\c01help
basic\c07" and "\c01help faq\c07" to get some really elementary help. You should also
be aware of our current Player Killing rules, so type "\c01help pk\c07" for that.
Ignorance is not an excuse.\c00

For \c02new players\c00 to the Dragon's Fang: Go up from the First Room
for a guided and full automated tour around the Mud's features!

Please note that all non-levelling channeling is \c01In Character\c00.
\c11Gate \c00is very much IC, at ALL times. Remember, not knowing \c01Policy\c00
is not an excuse.

\c01Buffering of tells\c00 is finally in. See \c11HELP BTELL\c00 for more
info about this subject.

\c01First Official Warding\c00 has finally arrived. See \c11HELP WARDS\c00
and \c11HELP WARD HUMAN\c00 for more info.

   It is a good idea to turn the nospam option on, if you haven't done so
yet. Just type "\c14nospam\c00" for that, and a symmetric and more structured
interface in your combat.

Roleplaying EXPs can now be gained - type "\c02help RPEXP\c00" for details.
\c01New commands\c00: Be sure to type "\c02help goic\c00" for details
on the IC/OOC modes, and Guildwalk is now available.

\c01Note:\c00 Type "\c02policy\c00" and particularly point \c0220\c00 before
tooling -or- keeping equipment not complying with it.
\c07Type \c08HELP CAEMLYN\c00.  \c14Have fun exploring!\c00
