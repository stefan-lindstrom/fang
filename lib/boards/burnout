      <text>Hey guys (and gals) Just thought I'd mention that when you burnout, before
posting on this board, type 'date' and then copy and paste that info into
the message here.  It gives a much easier way to deal with timetelling
than simply saying the date or whatever your time is.  According to
policy, 24 hours after posting on this board, you just need to remind an
immortal that you've burned out and they'll heal you up.  Also, you can
try to find someone who has 'heal gentling/stilling' before then, but
people who have that are few and very far between.    

An example of this 'date' thing would be like such:
*fake post* Burned out today.
Current machine time: Sun Dec 22 21:36:18 2002
Thanks!

Okies?  Hope this helps you newbies to burnouts :)
