      <text>When she was 2 months old, Katti's destiny was given a swerve. While 
travelling in a dark and gloomy forest, her family was ambushed. the 
robbers killed her mother and her father, tossing the baby in a bush. 
In that bush the crying infant was discovered by a wolverine.
The wolverine raised the child together with its own little ones. At 
the age of 13, Katti saw humans for the first time. The travelling 
merchant though, fearing that she might be a darkfriend chased her 
away. After that incident repeated a couple of times, Katti decided 
that it would be wiser to stay away from them. Thus, she led a life 
of seclusion.
While she lived in the forest, Katti learned to distinguishe between
types of herbs, and to use herbs for healing.
At an age of 17 Katti left the den of the wolverine. She had heard
about strange people, who can talk with the wolves, and about their
leader Perrin Aybara. Since rumors say that Mat Cauton is Perrin's
childhood friend, she decided to find him too and offer her healing
skills to his Band.

Hmmmm, what do you think?

      <text>Arctus was born in Caemlyn to a poor family. He had two siblings, Terast and Kallak. 
His family was barely able to support itself, always being forced to thievery to put 
dinner on the table. Kallak began takeing more of an intrest in theft and soon had 
joined with the local thieves guild. Terast began comeing down with severe sicknesses
 that would last for a short period then leave as suddenly as they came. It was around
 this time that arctus, at the age of 16, fled his home in search of something 
&quot;better. he brought with him only the clothes on his back, a dagger, and what food 
he could take from a vendor before fleeing. He immidietly hit problems, he did not 
know anything of the land or how to live off it, before the week was out he had depleted 
his food supply, his water only came from brooks  streams and ponds that he encountered 
on his way. After two days without food a weakened arctus ran across a village, so 
small that it would not register on any mpas. He quickly found work, running errands
 for a local crafter. He worked there for three months, earning coin and staying at 
the mans house as a guest. It dawned on him just how little he knew, of the world,
 of anything.  so he set out again, his lust for adventure burning, but with no real 
skills. He wandered for several months, getting by on
the coins he had earned. He never encountered any real trouble so he never
 learned any combat skills. by the time a year passes he finds himself back
 in his home city. With some knowladge of the crafters and with much more general
knowladge he was determined to help his family get back on their feet. Strangely,
 he could not find any of them, both parents and both siblings seemed to have disappeared. 
((sorry if this seems short but my first attempt at writeing this was cut off when i
 was about halfway through, im also going to be adding to his description and tooling
 his equipment to match. and this will be my third attempt to mail this to you))

Hello Mat. I would like to join the Band of the Red Hand. But I do not know if you 
accept Assassins. Well anyway. Here is my background.
Trelibor A'Garfola
This thirty three year old man stands just above average height. His long black hair is 
tied up in a ponytail and his face is covered in the growth of a three week old beard. 
He has a gleam in his eye that could be anything from anger to hatred. On his right arm
 he bears his family mark, a tattoo of a serpent twisted around a dagger, above the motto,
 'Shan a cuebiyar'.Trelibor A'Garfola is a bitter twisted man. When he was sixteen years
old, he got into a fight with a White Cloak and accidentally killed him. In order to
 prevent his whole family from being declared darkfriends, his family disowned him and 
ordered him to leave Caemlyn. He fled the city and spent the next few years wandering 
from place to place, learning the sword and the ways of a warrior. He became angered by 
the loss he felt at being forced to leave everyone he had loved.

Eventually he became very bitter and started using his skills another way. He became a 
mercenary, killing for money and enjoying every life he took. Soon he began to realise
 that if these Lords that hired him could afford the prices he charged, then they could
 afford to pay even more. He started stealing from the men that paid his wages. One day
 he was found out and once again had to flee to stay alive.
Some time later, he met a young woman called Marilyn. She was gathering firewood 
when she was attacked by two young men. Trelibor immediately rushed to her aid and
 soon one of her assailants was dead and the other was running for his life. It was 
love at first sight. She soon thought him the error of his ways and he started to work 
for her father, a village blacksmith. 
The years past and Trelibor started to yearn for the family he once had. Marilyn finally
 convinced him that it was time he went back. So after a few weeks they made there way to 
Caemlyn. But  he was devastated by what they found there. His parents dead and his only
other relative, his younger brother Gaindal missing. He vowed to find out who could have
 done this terrible thing and why. After some time questioning his old neighbours he
 discovered that his brother is indeed alive but that he had not been in the city for 
some time. He once again took up his sword and began the search for Gaindal.

If you do not accept members of the Assassins subguild, please mudmail me or Gaindal.
           Thank you.

      <text>Kyros is 18 years old at this time, though he does not have alot of combat
experience, a few thing happened to him that forced him into worldly experience
Kyros grew up right along the outskirts of Bandar Eban in a small village
to the north. When civil war broke out in Arad Doman, the rebels came from
the north and tried to get to the city, burning every village along the
way to the capital. When they reached Kyros' village they slaughtered
most of everyone in it, Kyros' mother was raped, his father murdered, all
while Kyros was out on his family's boat collecting the days fishing nets.
When he started coming back to shore he saw the billowing smoke and dropped
the nets and quickly came back where he found the aftermath of the rebels.
After that he blamed himself for the deaths and headed towards the marching
rebel army, when he found them he realized he was no match for them at all.
He snuck his way into thier camp at night and avoiding the guards he began
taking the oil lamps and emptying them on the tents, he lit some of them on
fire then fled towards the city, a few of the guards spotted him and they
chased him all the way to the city where he tried to hide for a few days
but he was spotted by the rebel search party that was in disguise and they
chased him to the docks where Kyros fled onto an Athan Meire ship, he told
them his story after almost loosing his head for not asking permission to
come aboard, but they simpathized with him and took him in untill their
next port destination, during that time he made friends with one of the
crewman, that friend had givin him a black tattoo around his neck to show
friendship to Kyros. They exchanged some knowlage and gifts as well.
The ship had traveled around the sea and through the archipelligos of
Tear and then traveled its way up towards Tar Valon where it stopped at
Aringill along the way, that is where Kyros got off, he thanked his
newly found friend and they said goodbye, the ship continues north while
Kyros made his way north east, doing small jobs for farmers to earn a
nights rest, he layed over in the various villages and towns untill he
ended up in Cairhien. When he got there there were rumors of battle and
one paticular group had been spoken of that was led by young man, that
group had incredible luck in winning against overbearing odds. That sparked
little ineterest in Kyros, still blaming himself for the death of his parents
he decided that maybe joining a non-affiliated army might gain him the
necissary skills he needed to avenge his parents, even if the army would
never lend its hand to Arad Doman, perhaps he could just get the skills
needed and then seek out that paticular band in general and kill them.
He decidide to find the group but he had learned he was too late and they
had already departed, so again he made his way through the land avoiding
trouble at all costs and thinking only of avenging his family. He reached
Caemlyn some time later, hitching a ride almost everyday there. he resides
there staying at the Queen's Blessing. He still asks around Caemlyn everyday
if there is anyword of the Band, and he will continue to seek them out
untill he finds them...

      <text>Hello Mat
I don't know if you remember me or not, but you helped me change my name a ways back.  Well I want to seek BotRH but I'm having a little trouble with my BG.  I was wondering, why do people join your army, besides for the fact that you always win, and you serve the Dragon Reborn.  Are these the only two reasons?  If not, could you help me out with some others...
P.S.- If you were wondering I wish to be a scout if that can help you help me
Thanks again for any help you can provide,
Trent

Hey, Here's my backround...
     ALus is a man born and raised in Arafel.  When he was young, the boys in arafel were taught the sword the time they are able to hold on.  Though Alus wasn't much of a fighter, he went on with the swordplay, and continued to live with the sowrd.  Alus doesn't really do much now, since his father died in a farm accident, and the blight border grew even more, he had no choice but to flee to camelyn.
    He thought he could run from the fighting, run from everything, but the expansion of the blight to his homeland grows more and more everyday, haunting him.  After finally convincing himself, he believes that the last battle is near, and he wishes to fight on the right side, the dragon...During his travels in Camelyn, he heard of a man leading an army who had this great luck....and he never lost a battle ever.  He is interested now, thinking he won't do much since, this army had great luck...
     ALus has a odd personality.  He is proud of himself, and doesn't think he's arrgant or conceited at all... he prefers to be &quot;Confident&quot;, when he really is arrogant and conceited.  Just another hot shot swordsman, thinking he can take on a whole formation of trollocs himself.

Hello Mat,
This is my BG:
My name is Trent Dina'aethan, son of Dameon and Dierdre.  My father, Dameon, is a bodyguard to a high ranking Cairhien family, and my mother, Dierdre, is a housewife, that takes care of my two younger brothers, Daron, 11, and Simeon, 8.  I was raised with a decent education, learning about most sciences and history, but my passion was the art of combat, which my father started teaching me at the age of 10.  My closest friend, Tohm, who was also the eldest son of the Cairhien man which my father protected, and I would always practice fighting, pretending we were members of the great Matrim Cauthon's army.
As we became older his father pulled us apart, leading him towards an education of politics and such, while I continued to dream of joining Cauthon's army.  I continued my training in combat with my father, but became an apprentice to a man named Kent, who was a tracker, at the age of 13.  He taught me about the forest and nature, and how to blend in with you suroundings and stalk your prey.  I continued apprenticing with him until the age of 19, at which time I had made a fair amount of money, enough to follow my true dream.
So I left my home, armed with a short sword that my father gave to me, and three long throwing knifes given to me by Kent, and supported with the little bit of money that I had made, to join the army of Matrim Cauthon.
Hope that's ok, if not just tell me whats wrong and I'll fix it...Thanks again
Trent Dina'aethan

This is the log for the RP I had with Dunsan.
In the The First Common Room of The Half Moon Inn
Dunsan says, &quot;Yeah.  Join the Band, or Whatever.&quot; [Grump] [BotRH] is lounging in the southeast corner of the room, facing the doorway.  His chairback is propped against the wall, and he is sprawled against it, the crimson emblem of the Band of the Red Hand blazoned clearly on the plain cotton tunic he wears.

-A small gust of wind is felt as #N opens the door and walks in slowly. He scans the area lightly, but not noticing anything of interest yet, he makes his way over to the bar and sits himself and orders a drink. (Trent)

-Dunsan puffs a deep sigh out through the beginnings of a rough mustache, and reaches out for the mug which rests on the table before him.  Giving it a halfhearted swish, he takes a small swig, and sets the beverage back down.

-Trent takes the drink from the barkeeps hand, nodding him a thanks.  He turns in his chair, scanning the room once more, and drinks from his mug, draining a quarter of it.  His eyes stop as they reach Dunsan, and his body stiffens.  He pulls the mug from his mouth and smiles childeshly.  He drops a few coins on the bar, and heads over to Dunsan's table, mug in hand.

-Dunsan notices Trent's approach, but doesn't move much, just following the man cross the room with a lazy drift of his eyes.
-Trent reaches Dunsan's table and looks down with an errie smile.  He speaks with youthful exuberance, &quot;Excuse me sir, that crest on your tunic.  Is that not the emblem of the great Matrim Cauthon's army?&quot; his eyes light up with hope.
-Dunsan tilts his chin, slowly looking Trent up and down.  &quot;That it is.&quot;  He says laconically.  His eyes linger over the swordhilt at Trent's hip.  &quot;You ever use that thing?&quot; He asks somewhat dubiously, making no attempt at politeness.
-Trent looks down at his hip, then looks back to Dunsan with a arrogant stare, &quot;Aye, there have been times I have had to draw my steel on another,&quot; he pulls a chair up from behind himself, sits across from Dunsan, then nods toward Dunsan's brightly polished axe, and grins, &quot;Have you ever used that?&quot; his voice still filled with excitement.

-Dunsan shrugs, and replies in a rather disinterested tone.  &quot;A few.&quot;  He plucks at his tabard with the fingers of his right hand.  &quot;What about this was it that you found so interesting?&quot;
-Trent shakes his stare from the gleaming axe back to Dunsan's face, &quot;I have been seeking to join with Cauthon and his army for some time now,&quot; he raises his glass and drinks heavily from it, slowly placing it back on the table, &quot;It has been my personal goal in life for as long as I can remember.&quot;
-Dunsan raises an eyebrow.  &quot;You've got a short memory, then.  Lord Mat's only been a general since two years back, 'r so.&quot;  He says.  Taking a long look at the mask covering the face of the man seated opposite him, he adds, &quot;You get hit on the head, or somesuch?&quot;

-Trent shakes his head in disbelief, and quickly pulls his mask back so it rest atop his head, &quot;Nah, nothing like that, just a little souvenir from my apprenticeship.&quot; he completely removes it and looks down at it with a smile tracing the outline of green, black, and brown with his fingers.

      <text>-Dunsan frowns.  &quot;Ah.  Curious thing, that...&quot;  He shrugs it off.  &quot;So you want to join up, do you?&quot;

-Trent drops the mask on the table and looks up, &quot;Aye, that I do,&quot; he leans forward in his chair slightly, and picks up his mug and drains the rest of his drink.
-Dunsan nods his head, and leans forward enough to send the front legs of his chair thumping to the floor.  &quot;Well, then, why should we take you?  Plain crowds of men want to join the Band, since word of the General's luck got about.&quot;
-Trent is taken aback a bit with this question, almost as if caught by surprise, &quot;I have spent 9 years training with the sword and other combat techniques, I have been well schooled, and have apprenticed as a tracker for 6 years.&quot; he pauses and swallows hard, &quot;I am a hard worker and can learn what needs to be known, please, give me a chance.&quot;

-Dunsan blinks in clear suprise, and straightens up, exclaiming,  &quot;Nine Years?!?!?  Bloody Hell!  What do you want to be, a flaming warder?&quot;  He calms down a bit as he notices people staring from various places around the room, and settles back into his seat.  &quot;Light man, we're just a bunch of bloody soldiers....you could get a fair sight better wages enrolling with the Queen's Guard, or the Companions, or some such.&quot;  He seems a little offended by the notion of nine years of training.

-Trent is again surprised at Dunsan's reaction, &quot;If I had wished to join them, I would have...&quot; he looks away then back to Dunsan, &quot;If you will not help me join the army, I -WILL- do it alone, although the latter will take considerably longer.&quot; he picks up his mug and looks down into it, then back up to Dunsan.
-Dunsan rubs his nose.  &quot;No, not really.  I'm not the only recruiter in town, but you ought to realize that the Band is an army, boy.  An army.  If I say no, the guy who says &quot;yes&quot; damn well better outrank me by a sight.&quot;  He looks Trent up and down again, sighing.  &quot;Look, you're more than qualified to join, but are you entirely sure that you really want to enlist?  I mean, light knows there are better outfits to join, the General aside.&quot;
-Trent stands and looks down toward Dunsan, &quot;Believe me, I have thought about this hard and long...this is the path I wish to take,&quot; he continues to stand awaiting Dunsan's response.
-Dunsan nods.  &quot;Fair enough.  Since you're so determined, I suppose it wouldn't hurt you to meet me at the Ball and Hoop tonight, round suppertime?&quot;  He raises an eyebrow.
-Trent looks down to Dunsan, a wide smile crossing his face, he bows deeply, &quot;Thank you sir, I shall be there.&quot;
-Dunsan rolls his eyes.  &quot;And drop the 'sir'... I'm no lord, just a soldier with some years under his belt, eh?&quot;  He slumps back into his chair.
-Trent corrects himself with a nod, &quot;Then may I ask what name should I call you by?&quot;
-Dunsan grunts, &quot;Dunsan.  Name's Dunsan.  Yours?&quot;

-Trent smiles broadly, &quot;I am Trent, Trent Dina'aethan.&quot;
The end...

      <text>I did some roleplay with Trent today....he's decent enough in roleplay, but
he seems to have some misconceptions about the Band icly, and he's a bit
overtrained to be a grunt, so I guess he wants to be a scout.  All in all,
he's fairly good, and his roleplay is technically proficient.  I say guild him.

  To: Mat
From: vangoren
Okay well I want to join the band....And I warn you to give
me leniency cos I have not read the series of books.

I was taken from my parents when young (I do not know of them)
and forced to sell Jewellery as an attractive girl-child on the
streets of Tear.  When I matured I decided to start a search 
for adventure, and ended up in the colourful city of Caemlyn.
*Okay now I'm not so sure and was thinking*
I heard of the band from a stranger on the street, and
decided that it was them that could offer me the life
that I seeked.

Thank you,
Vangoren

Was born in a small village outside Caemlyn, 
lived there with his parents and two younger brothers. 
The to Harvest had been bad and three sons of Gared Ethar 
were getting worried and restless. When I started to talk 
about getting out to see the world my father only murmuired 
something about youth. But he never said I couldn't go. 
My father learned me some tecniques with the sword. 
Just so I could do something with it. I wanted to see the 
world and learn something else than farming. When I got to 
Caemlyn I realized how isolated I had been, I'd been there before
but never been able to stroll around in my own. At once I 
started to hear about news &amp; events from all over. The news
that's interested me the most was those about a man called Mat.
The things he and his Band of the Red Hand had accomplihed was
amazing. After a while when got to know a few people and find 
my way around I made my living doing all kinds of tasks. 
It gave me enough money to survive, but I really wanted to meet
a member of the Band and even join them if possible.

Boulvai D'mornia, a north man from the northwest corner of the continent,
occupant of a now burned and destroyed village where mountain's meet the sea in
the Saldean region west of Maradon.    
Personality -
Boulvai is a leader, strong and fierce in combat, yet highly
intelligent and open minded. He believes in belonging
to a cause greater than himself, training hard 
with the others of his village.

History -
At 15 midsummers, Boulvai's parents were killed in a battle
against a force of Trollocs while defending the small 
village from their attack. He was then taken in by his 
Uncle Borik, who served as a soldier in Saldea as well
as a skilled craftsman and blacksmith.
Many years passed (10) and Boulvai was recognized
as the leader of the village. Dreadfully, the village
was attacked in a fierce battle as a battallion of
Trollocs moved down from the mountains that served
as a barrier from the Blight and all was lost, 
Boulvai was left for dead, but life still stirred 
in his chest. After the massacre, he travelled into 
the Blight and climbed high upon one of the many 
peaks calling out in a strong, deep, booming voice, 
swearing he would never stop until the shadow
had been smited and all it's creations destroyed
successfully.
Boulvai journeyed to the Inland river closest to his
now destroyed village and was greeted with open arms 
and hired as a soldier for hire aboard an inland barge heading 
for Whitebridge. After his tour of duty, he was payed well 
and departed heading east to Caemlyn on horseback.
He has just recently come to Caemlyn and will be 
residing at the Ball and Hoop.
He seeks to join an Army dedicated on defeating the shadow, 
an army that will use his skills, his sword and his heart
in the ultimate goal of truth. 
Boulvai.

      <text>Name: Prentis 
Full Name:*classified* Anna Prentis (an apprentice, get it)
I don't remember anything before my 18th birthday, you see i was in
training when i reicved a blow on the back of my head. I do have
flashbacks from time to time, but thats when something in the present
triggers some memory that happened in the past.
For example: When i awoke in a room(i belive it was my room
) i overheard the wisdom saying,&quot;he was in grave danger, but he has
come out of it now.&quot;. When she said (grave) i saw my father being
lawered into a grave, and a family retainer handed me my fathers swords
saying,&quot;you have to carry on the family name.&quot;. I had returned from my
memory trip before the wisdom stoped speaking.
How i got the name Prentis,well it happened like this:
I was awake when i overheard the wisdom talking to man. She said,&quot; He
does not remember his name, and we must not tell him. He must remember 
the past on his own.&quot; The man said,&quot;I know his name. He is an apprentice
(Anna Prentis). I am a blademaster and him my student... ,&quot;i could not
hear any more of what they said. But the damage had been done, i knew 
my name. What had gone wrong for my mother to name me (a young man)
Anna.
So how did i get here?
Well on one night i approched the duty guard and told him remembered
who i was and what had happned to me. He must have belived me or was
new to the gaurd. I was allowed to leave without a word. I still don't
know if they are looking for me, but then again every person i meet
doesn't reconize my name as runaway or missing person.
Why do i want to join the &quot;Band Of The Red Hand&quot;:
1: Fame (that would only be possible if i could get people to remember
me as a great man and a leader of men. not a man with a womans name.)

2: Money (great, but you can't buy loyalty with coins much less 
respect.)
respect.)
3: Leadrership (must have knowledge of Warfare and Logistics. I might have 
those but i can't remember them at present.

4: Honor (I don't know how i lasted as long as i did, but the shame 
of being named a womans name is to great. Hopefully i will get a 
new name from within the ranks of men i will fight side by side
with or lead. In any case i hobe to win back my honor.&quot;

5
5: Pride (i want to be in a place where i can take pride in what
i know and what i have done in the service of great men till
one day i may become a great man.)
General Discription:
Height: 6'2&quot;
weight: 180lbs.
Hair: Black
Eyes: Hazel
Build: Medium
[ Return to continue, (q)uit, (r)efresh, (b)ack, or page number (1/2) ]

Im am seen as am man with alot on his mind, walking around with 
twin swords straped onto his back with the pommel of each on the
right and left side of his head, both in perfect position for 
overhand drawof both swords.

      <text>Issunboshi was born in Seandar, where he grew up as an active youth,
playing war with his friends, using sticks as staff, spears, swords,
knifes, etc.  He became the leader of a group friends when he was
around six or seven.  These kids managed to cause a lot of problems
for the city, troubling strangers/travlers, stealing food from a
merchant, and other types of chaos.  This continued for a year until
Issunboshi decided to pull a prank on a passing soldier.  The soldier
managed to turn Issunboshi's plan upside down, catching Issunboshi
and taking him back to his parents.  His parents had been so
dishonored by Issunboshi for all the trouble that he had caused, and
doubly so with the soldier.  They decided to give the sol dier
Issunboshi.  The soldier took Issunboshi in and became a mentor to
him, teaching him honor\ and discipline.  Issunboshi came to know the
soldier as Kuroiboshi.  Kuroiboshi also taught Issunboshi how to use
a staff, spear, archery, and horseback rinding.  The style of
swordmanship was very different than the known style, (Heron Wades
the Rushes, Boar;Running down the Mountain, etc.  ).  The form
Issunboshi learned involved swords with only one edge, the blades
slightly curved, and the blade being the same width from
tip-to-pomel, and from the edge to the back of the blade.  **NOTE**
THE SWORD IS NOT A SCIMITAR Kuroiboshi also taught him an interesting
weapon comprised of a curved blade attached perpendicular to the
handle with a long chain attached to the handle.  Issunboshi learned
how to use another interesting weapon that Kuroiboshi had had a
blacksmith make, it w as a staff with foot long blades at either end.
The staff was five feet long (including the blades).  The blades had
only one edge and were both slightly curved.  The edges faced
opposite directions.  When he was 18, Kuroiboshi took him back to his
parents.  Kuroiboshi gave Issunboshi a bow, two swords (one curved,
one straight), and the staff.  Issunboshi had become one of the best
blade wielders in town as well as in archery.  Issunboshi won a lot
of matches in contests that used the staff, bow, and sword.  When an
order from the Empress came about the Forerunners returning back to
the Oathbreakers' (OB) land, there was much talk in the city.  A
messenger arrived to call out names of those who were to leave with
the Forerunners.  Issunboshi's name was called out as well as those
of his friends.  When Issunboshi joined the Seanchan army, he was
placed into a troop of soldiers and then ordered to boa rd a boat
headed for Falme.  When he arrived he was permenantly placed in an
elite core of fighters that would attack the right side of the Dragon
Reborn's army.  The plan failed when a mareth'damane began to use the
One Power on them.  The troop that Issunboshi was placed in had been
slaughtered.  Only a handful including Issunboshi managed to escape
and rejoin the main body of the Seanchan army.  When they rejoined,
the Seanchan ordered the soldiers that fled the battle to hang for
treason.  The soldiers were convicted of treason against the Empress
for leaving their fellow soldiers.  (Issunboshi believed it was
because somebody had;to be blamed for the fiasco.  ) Issunboshi and
his friends, came up with a desperate plan to escape the Seanchan
army.  When the plan was executed, Issunboshi and a couple others
were the only ones to escape the Seanchan with their lives.  
Issunboshi went underground and hid from the Seanchan.  He lived off
the money the Seanchan payed him.  When it was running low, he sold
himself as a bodyguard or a mercenary after first hiding his armor so
know one could recognize him for a Seanchan.  During one of his
mercenary jobs, he heard about an army called the Band of the Red
Hand.  It was said that the Band had never lost a battle.  The BOTRH
was led by one called, Matrim Cauthon.  Issunboshi began to get
interested in the group of soldiers.  He decided he wanted to join
the ranks of the BOTRH.  He is looking for the BOTRH or a soldier
