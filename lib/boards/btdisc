      <text>No, I'm not confused with the Gskills.  I simply think that's
a better order to get'em. =P

      <text>I was under the impression that one was not allowed to recruit without the tag.  As I was told, &quot;You can't do the seeker RP without the subrank.&quot;  Furthermore, basing it off of IC rank (which is what you do when you limit it to Dedicateds or above) still defeats the purpose of an OOC title.

      <text>List boards is really silly sometimes.
In response to your post:
At the time you were told that only Recruiters could give seeker RP, that 
was the way the policy was leaning.  The lean has since changed, as it 
would be rather silly to say only a few people in the guild can bring 
seekers in.  There are two parts to being a Recruiter.  While it is almost 
entirely an OOC rank, there is an IC part.  Being Dedicated is a 
requirement because Soldiers do not have the time or permission needed to 
run a full-scale recruitment party on their own.  It is assumed that 
Recruiters would be doing this.  The OOC part is the trust placed in the 
Recruiter to be able to distinguish between a good seeker RP and a 
less-than-good seeker RP.

Forgive me if this doesn't make sense or fails to answer your question.  I 
am coughing up blood.

      <text>It makes sense, yet it doesn't.  Chew on that!

Saying that ICly a Recruiter (OOC Rank) will be leading a party is quite false.  Over 90% of seeker RP takes place in Caemlyn, the standard &quot;Boy sees Asha, boy asks Asha about the farm, Asha acts tough, tests&quot;.  As soon as basic training was completed, even Soldiers are taught how to test--which is all that most seeker Rp is made of.  If you are to assume that a Recruiter (the ooc kind) is RPing his character as going around and actively &quot;recruiting&quot; in the villages, then I suggest you change the definition of the rank.  Or, bring it back to the application method.
