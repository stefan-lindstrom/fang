      <text>Hey all!

Just a quick note to let everyone know I'm stepping in as guildleader for now. If you know me, great! If not, feel free to get to know me! :) I've been playing here for about four years or so, and been in the Entertainers almost as long. I love meeting new players, especially if they're gonna be entertainers!
Feel free to contact me about anything (if you need/want something for your character that I might be able to provide, hey, even if you just want to chat, let me know! :) I'm online generally every night I can be, starting around 10 pm EST. If you don't see me, and need something, just send me a mudmail and I'll get back to you asap!) My connection is a little sketchy for the next six weeks, but I think we'll manage.
So, I guess that's that. :) Let me know of any ideas you have for this guild, and also where your characters are at right now. I want to try and get a clear picture of what's going on with everyone, see where we stand as a guild.
Hope to hear from everyone soon!

      <text>&amp;G&lt;yodaish voice&gt;&amp;gWhere all the entertainers went to has, I wonder&amp;G&lt;/yodaish voice&gt;&amp;n
Everyday I only see the same old four notes at this board, crumbled and
yellow from age, and the only soul being on the guildlist is my own poor
self..amd I truly the only entertainer left alive? (shrug) I cannot think
that the world has gone so wrong..(sniffle)

The poor would-be entertainer crying silently in the corner

      <text> I've had a rp sessions each with Doric and Cerryl and I think they
would fit in fine amongst the other entertainers..if Jen want logs,
she can just drop me an email addy where I can send them..

      <text>Just in case ya'll didn't catch it on the OOC board, I'm regurgitating material here for ya! :) (Aww, isn't that so great? Just like a momma bird and *is sacked* Oof... right then.. Getting on with it.)
Backgrounds (this shouldn't really affect you all, but it might, never know) are now to be sent to the immies via e-mail: FangBackgrounds@hotmail.com
As our immie is now, again, Amarinda (give her a hug! She'll need one from dealing with us rowdy and rambunctious folk, eh? :D) she'll be the one reading through 'em and stuff. Yeah. So, if bugged by seekers for any sort of backgrounds reason, send 'em that way.
RPlogs will now be sent (again, via e-mail) to:  FangRPLogs@hotmail.com
Again, Amarinda will be the one reading these, so make sure they're all nice and neat and awesome entertainment! :D

That's about it from me for now, I think. :) Take care of yourselves, and stay fun!!

      <text>In approx. 48 hours, I will be on my back to school. This wouldn't be such a problem, if my school didn't have a nasty firewall up, blocking me from muddin'. Well, supposed to be blocking me from downloading stuff, but.. anyway, the fact remains that there is a high probability that I will be even more elusive than usual. However, if I am needed, I can always be found at &amp;Gtribsel@hotmail.com&amp;n, or for you AIM users, screen name: &amp;Gtribsel&amp;n. 
Thanks for reading, and I'll be back on, once packing is done. :)

      <text>Just in case there are any active Entertainers out there, this is just a
post to let you know that I'm going to be handling all of the guild
matters from now on.  If you need to get in touch with me then mudmail is
good, my email info as well as other ways to get with me are included in
my contactinfo.

      <text>I'm sad about multiple things.  I won't see jenjen much *not like i can get on much*, and that i don't have the net anymore.  If i'm at my parents or such, i might be able to get on.  So, thanks to a car crash, guess where i'll be for a couple of days.

      <text>Hi. It's obvious my name is Jaise, but it's not so obvious what this is about. I assume this board is pretty old, with the latest post date reading at November 29th. I was curious as to whether anyone reads this board anymore. If you've got an entertainer alt, and you're itching for some roleplay, hit me up. I'll be glad to oblige.
