      <text>It is said that Lady Ferandal Vorgatine has returned home after a long
absence.  This arrival has sent rumors drifting through the air as to her
reasons, and the circumstances of several changes to her person.  The most
obvious reason for her return is the upcoming birthday of her mother, Lady
Claire Vorgatine, yet there is doubt as to that being the true reason for
her return with the absence of her siblings Serandal and Verandal.  Only
time will tell what her return truly means, and there is no doubt that it
will be revealed to open ears in due time.

News spreads through the city like wildfire that the young Lord Fenevall's
newborn daughter has been kidnapped. Criers walk the streets announcing a
reward of thirty gold marks for information that leads to the whereabouts
of the child.

A lone horseman was noted as leaving through the east gate yesterday 
morning.  This would not normally be of interest, but he was dressed in 
the personal livery of Cordell Fenevall of House Damodred. This would 
have raised few eyebrows either if not for the heavily wrapped bundle the 
man refused to let the guards inspect and the fact that the large man was 
definitely not Cairhienin. Our own good people starving in the streets 
and our nobles hiring foreigners. Disgraceful.
&amp;n
Later that afternoon, the Lord Fenevall and his Aes Sedai advisor were 
seen leaving the city in some haste by the same gate. They were 
travelling much more lightly than one normally expects of people of their 
station, especially people travelling by coach.
&amp;n
A black and silver liveried coachman was seen returning to the city just 
before the Watch closed the gates for the night. He returned without the 
passengers, and indeed, without the coach.
