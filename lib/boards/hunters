      <text>--&amp;cGuild Purpose&amp;n
The Hunters for the Horn is a guild dedicated to enjoyment
through Roleplay, bringing the greatest amount of
entertainment to the greatest number.
 
However, the guild was not constructed to give you a path
to follow. You will be expected to choose your own Roleplay.
If you ask us &quot;What do I do now?&quot;, we will most likely
answer &quot;Whatever you like.&quot;
 
--&amp;cGuildleader&amp;n
The role of the Hunter Guildleader includes:
     &amp;co &amp;nGeneral guild-direction guidance
     &amp;co &amp;nOut of Character support/advisement, when requested
     &amp;co &amp;nHandling of equipment, guildskills, and sponsorship
       rights
     &amp;co &amp;nGuildquests
     &amp;co &amp;nInduction and promotion of Guildmembers
     &amp;co &amp;nGuild Advertisement/Publicity
     &amp;co &amp;nOut of Character punishment administration
 
The role of the Hunter Guildleader doesn't necessarily include:
     &amp;co &amp;nIn Character leadership
     &amp;co &amp;nSyllabus enforcement
 
If a Guildleader is thought not to be doing his/her job
adequately, first bring it to the GL him/herself in a clear,
concise manner stating what has been infringed, if possible. If
this doesn't work, bring it to the Head GL. Never publically
flame - it is far from constructive.
 
--&amp;cPromotions&amp;n
Hunters of the Horn of Valere are not an organized group of
people or society of some sort at all. They only share a
common goal and &quot;home base&quot;, which usually makes them more
competitive than anything else. Thus, no syllabus or training
guide to &quot;become&quot; a Hunter is to be used.
 
Furthermore, ranks are not to be used as IC indicators of
experience, deed, or importance. If you are a &quot;higher&quot; rank
than another person, you still have no say over that person.
You merely have shown that you deserve a better title.
&quot;Higher&quot; ranks are, however, expected to conduct themselves
in a befitting manner.
 
Please note that ranks are meant to indicate your character's
IC condition. Divisions are not &quot;better&quot; than one another;
they are only different in providing for different kinds of
characters.
 
Promotions will be given based on activity, roleplay, and
merit. If you are consistantly logging on and your roleplay
is improving, you are being a good Hunter. That is expected
of you. You may nominate other guildmembers for consideration
in promotion, but ranks are at the GL's discretion. If you
believe your rank is unfair, take it to the GL like any
other issue.
 
--&amp;cActivity&amp;n
There is no proper way to gauge activity. Someone may set
triggers for idling and no GL, no matter how alert, can
humanly detect whether an online person is legitimately
RPing or not. However, a general idea of how often a
guildmember logs on and RPs is easily calculated.
 
Activity is largely dependant on frequency of RP, but quality
factors in greatly to almost every other issue.
 
If a guild member does not log in without reason for 3 weeks,
he/she will be set to Inactive subrank.

      <text>The following progressions/unique ranks are available in the Hunter guild:

Oathtaker Hunter/Huntress, Experienced, Renowned, Legendary

Student of the Blade, Swordsman, Skilled Swordsman, Champion

Footpad, Cutpurse, Thief, Rogue, Infamous

Retainer, Servant, High Servant, Advisor

Informant, Detective, Sleuth, Chalk Talker

Lord/Lady
Minor Lord/Lady

Thieftaker
Notorius
Captain
Spy
Guard
Servant
Mercenary
Assassin
Prophet of the Horn
Prophetess of the Horn
Blademaster
Cartographer
Chronicler of the Great Hunt
Master/Mistress of the Hunt

Any rank in the first two levels of any progression may be claimed by any
member of the guild, after a short period of settling in.  Beyond that,
any higher ranks will be awarded at the GL's discretion, based on what
progress a character may have made towards Glory and Renown.  The final
rank in each and every one of the progressions will most likely require
a great deal of roleplay, a particularly exciting character, and also
some small degree of reputatation among the rest of the MUD's populace.
They will be -extremely- rare, denoting those Hunters whose reputation
and accomplishments have earned them a place in the legends, in some
small degree.

      <text>That's a tad inaccurate.  I am still known as Daene, just not around here
so much, because any rp I ever did with this alt was under the assumed
name Alyse.  As you can see, Alyse still exits, but I'll no longer be this
guilds Imm GL, they've moved me over to the White Tower and right now it
needs so much work that I apparently can't do both.  I'll be on as Daene
most often - so yes, you can still ask me about seeking stuff, I'll still
be here to sponsor and play as Alyse.  But for now, at least, Hunters is
missing an Imm GL.  And I hope..  That I looked after you guys well
enough.    

Because I'm still around, I can still handle almost any guild matter
that needs seen to, and if I can't, I know the man that can.

Just.. don't think I'm running out on you.

      <text>He lies.  Cordell is not the sole GL of the Hunters.  He is one of
a pair of GLs.  And what a pair we make.  -wild laughter-  Anyway,
I am sure you all know who I am, and what I am, and why I am... so
I won't bore you with the details.  Just suffice it to say that at
long long last, someone has made the severe error of placing power
into my hands. What this means is that, um, I will be available to
putter about and help you guys get things done,  using not only my
considerable natural charm,  but also the handy dandy imm abilites
which I have, en alt.

Please feel free to contact me with any ideas you have in regards
to your own character, or to the orchestration of any whole guild
roleplay.  For now, I am going to occupy myself with some building
projects, including a rsssurection of the old Hunter Guildzone.

See you all around,

      <text>   Try to hold your adulation until the end of this post :) i am back,
once again, and i should be here for a while since i am now settled at
college, and i have my own computer, and can control my own hours.  If you
see me on, my char has changed a little bit to reflect the change in clubs
(my assassin's club was wiped, and so was my rival assassin's club.  ) so
my char is a little less...  Hostile...  Now.  He has a better lease on
life, but i'm sure you all wanted to know this.  Well, if you see me on,
say hi and rp with me...  Or i shall find you...  ;)

      <text>Hey there, Lord Auric Damodred here, as the title of this post suggests,
I'm posting in hopes that someone will respond with some much needed help.
You see, I happen to posess some inside knowledge as to the whereabouts
of the Horn which ensures my place in history, along with those who
acompany me.  This is where you might come in.  I was all ready to start
my journey to find the Horn when my servant/fellow hunter stopped playing.
That leaves me without anyone to attend to my various needs, and help me find
the Horn.  So, I am looking for a servant, a fellow hunter to accompany me, or,
preferably, someone who can fill both positions.  If you are a newbie hunter,
or an oldbie who feels his character has grown stagnant, please mudmail me and
see if we can work something out.  It will be a grand adventure.

      <text>Muahaha. Yup, that's Paige you see on your gchan all the time. Hunters
fell into the Home Lands category and that happens to be the group she
leads. Therefore, for those spiffy things that only an imm can do, be
sure you abuse her. I hear she likes sheep. And chippies. At least we
know what sheep are.. I'm kinda concerned on the chippie intake but I
guess that's what happens when a kiwi comes around.

On another note, the odd couple will continue to GL the guild. Are you
afraid? I am. *shivers and wanders off*
