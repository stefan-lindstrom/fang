      <text>If you are one of these clearly masochistic individuals, you should drop me
a line sometime.  I like swords.  I like swords.  I like.....err, sorry.  I
hate it when that happens.  As I was saying, I'm one of those crazy people
who actually enjoys emote combat for its own sake, and if you can catch me
online and in the proper mood, I'd be glad to go a few rounds with you, in
any sort of IC environment you'd like - Salidar, Tar Valon, Somewhere Else
Entirely...

I'm told, by a majority of the voices in my head, that there is absolutely
no substitute for experience if you want to get good at emote combat.  This
is why you should drop me a line sometime, so we can spar.  I make a damn
fine sparring dummy, if I do say so myself.

-Adhemar, a.k.a.:

Aemon, Amalric, Brann, Dunsan, Hadraen, Katore, Kienath, Soran, Tancred,
Tanen, Terain, Tevak, Vatharl, and Qur'san.  Tancred's contactinfo is, to
the best of my knowledge, accurate.  So you can use that to find me if the
entire menagerie of my alts seems to be absent.

      <text>Although I'm a big slouch in this guild :P, I would like to put down for
the record that I will spar with anyone who wants one.  I doesn't matter
what tower you are in, I have a warder in each tower and will not
hesistate to spar, because...  Well...  They're fun.  Now, I'm nowhere
near as good as Adhemar, but thats not the point.  Everyone spars a bit
different and it's the experience that counts.  And if one of my
characters is out of their tower, I'll play an NPC, doesn't bother me any.
A list of my various alts can be found here: Claude, Khalil, Gardoan,
Aljayn, Lance, Talbain, Jaell, Galdar, Kelmor, Faris.  And....  I think
there are some more...  But I can't remember who they are.

      <text>Hi.  Just wanted to point something out to all of you.
None of you are warders.  You're regular shmucks
who play warders.  Change your mentalities.  Playing
a warder on Fang is not a lifestyle.  It's a character
archetype, nothing more.  Quit thinking it's something
all important.  I'm so sick of hearing about &quot;having
heart&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot; that I think I'll kill someone the
next time they puke that BS all over this board.
The instant you realize you're blowing the &quot;meaning&quot;
of this guild out of proportion, and the meaning of
what it is to PLAY, not BE, play, a warder, is the
instant you'll begin a more balanced and healthy
existence on Fang.

      <text>Pardon to interupt, but warders are servants. You are a personal
servant and protector of an Aes Sedai. Sure, dangerous, but still
a personal servant. If she tells you to fetch tea, then you do it
and most of the time, had best not hear an argument. You might
make suggestions and advise the right path or course of action,
but really guys, you jump when she says too. That points to a
servant in my book, even if a dangerous one.

      <text>I think it's funny you hate the idea of serving Aes Sedai
so much.  I just hope you realize it makes you inherently
wrong for playing a warder and also that... When people
talk about serving an Aes Sedai, it's not like they're talking
washing dishes.  It's just a general term referring to role-
playing with an Aes Sedai counterpart, within the world of
the Aes Sedai-- because it is their world, their respective
Tower, their agendas.  What most people gripe about in
the books, yeah?  Yeah.  Again I bring up the concept of
humility, as foreign as it is on this board, it would seem.

PS- The next time I see someone capitalize the word
&quot;guild&quot; when referring to the warders, I swear to God
I will personally nuke their playerfile.

      <text> In an effort to try and explain myself.. for one, no one is
going to get their playerfile deleted.  That was just me
venting.  But I realize that some of you don't understand
why that would aggravate me, so I'll try and explain.
For one it's bad english which in and of itself bothers me.
Some of you have probably seen me correct spelling and
grammar on OOC and so forth :P  It's annoying to me, is
all.  In a world that consists of -just- text, my thinking is
that a little effort could be made to use the language
properly since that's.. all we have here.  Feel free to snicker
at the grumpy anal bastard that I am sometimes.
  For two though, and this is a more real reason as far as
I am concerned, it's a symbol of elitism to me.  When
Lannes says &quot;Warder Guild&quot;, that isn't even that bad to me.
But when I see someone saying &quot;the Guild&quot; as if there is
no other, none other that matters, it bothers me.  I've tried
to explain this to Embreth, but much of what I say, no
matter how plainly I put it, or what emphasis I place on
certain points, it doesn't seem to matter to him.  You can
all, feel free, don't get me wrong, to hate me for wanting to
take emphasis off of the warders.  You can think I'm evil and
out to get you and that I want to thrust my ideals onto all
of you.  That's fine.  All I am trying to help with though, is
balance.  Laugh all you want.  The word balance is normally
applied to our code, or the lack of balance it has but that's
not what I mean.  I'm trying to look at the bigger picture and
redirect interest to other guilds, other character types because
we simply cannot exist as a MUD if we're soley populated by
warders.  Can we?  I mean.. maybe we should, we may as
well already with the way it's so popular to behave in a manner
so as to discount anyone who isn't a warder or an aspiring
warder.  I just want variety for God's sake :P  Variety in
characters, in roleplay, and yeah, in how we think about things.
I can't force you to think one way or the other, I realize, but
that doesn't mean I can't be pissy with you either.  People
get pissy with me all the time...

      <text>Spring cleaning has come. What this means is that old posts on the boards have 
been removed. If there's something that was removed that you'd like to see 
put back up or put into ghelp files, mail me the information or repost it 
yourself.

As most of the messages were removed, I'll go over a few things. First up is 
the syllabus and required lessons. There is &amp;uno&amp;n syllabus or anything that 
is required for advancement. This does not mean that you are not free to spar, 
give or receive lessons, and the like. What it means is that it is no longer 
required to do so. You only become a warder if you bond. Unless you never 
intend to bond and decide to switch over into the Tower Guard/Rebel Watch, 
you will remain a trainee until an Aes Sedai bonds you.

Following that, being a warder means serving your Aes Sedai in any way that 
she requires you to, be it carrying books, protecting her, acting as her eyes 
and ears. Anything at all. Take it how you wish, as I'm sure you all will. 

Regardless of your personal take on things, there is no set way to play a 
warder. The only requirement is the want to serve your Aes Sedai. Other than 
that, warders are not all the same. Each one has their own reasons for bonding, 
yet they all serve in one way or another. Now that I've taken my opportunity 
to kick the dead horse, we'll move on.

Final note. It is great that you guys love the guild, that you guys love 
emote combat. It is not so great if you think of yourself as a warder instead 
of your character being that warder. I'd suggest seeking out professional 
help if this is the case with you. *smiles sweetly*

I'm sure that at least one of you has a comment or flame for me after
reading this. My door is open for such things, public boards are not.

      <text>I would just like to say that, though there is no set syllabus, the
-reason- I went along with it so easily is because I know that without it
true teachings can flourish.  So, I would be very unhappy if I ever saw
anyone refuse to give a lesson using the non syllabus as the reason.  A
Gaidin must serve his Sedai.  That does not mean he cannot learn things
and skills withing this guild to serve her better.  In fact, that's why we
are here.  Also, another point: when before a trainee would be done with
his lessons and take his Test, once a person became a Gaidin, it was
allright for him to stop training, to stop being, to stop -wanting- to be
a Gaidin.  Under this system, the learning never ends, the determination
to be the best you can be in total and utter humble servitude for her also
never ends.  And so I ask each and every one of you, think not of making
things better with a set syllabus...  But do think of making things
better.  Remember, when a person comes into our guild, and sees people who
are so experienced what they do, at least some of them need a friendly
guiding teacher to show them what is expected of them.  Do we do this for
ourselves, or so the Warders themselves have glory?  No, our glory, our
reason for being, is to do whatever our Aes Sedai need of us.  Some may
think because of that we do not spar anymore, but that is far from the
case.  Instead, we are expanding what serving means to mean all parts of a
Warder's life.  Some say this can't be taught...  I would venture that it
does take discipline to do what we do, and to put someone above ourselves,
so that -every- Rp we do as a Warder is either directly for her or
indirectly learning for her.  A good Gaidin uses all three, the heart, the
mind, and the body to serve her in any way he can.  The Gaidin have always
strove to be great on this MUD...  But not always for the right reasons.
For what good is it to become great at emote combat...  If the purpose is
not to fulfill our timeless duty, but instead to gain a Heron and the
respect of our peers?  The true Warder uses emote combat to serve her, in
total deference to the skill he posesses.  In fact, I think some of the
greatest emote fighters ever, those like Aidan and a few others of course,
have become great as that -because- they dedicated thier skill not to
themselves, but to the women who they, like me, are honored to serve.  Of
course feel free to disagree, that's what this board is for, and I will
listen carefully to all disagreements, but, this is my take on things.  
Bottom line is, teach someone to serve!!!!  &amp;mEmbreth

      <text>A &quot;Warder&quot; does not use emote combat to serve his Sedai.  He uses a sword.  We, the players of said Warders (which, as a point of clarification, are still not real and never will be) can, in some instances, call upon the ability to roleplay a swordfight as part of our character's lives.  And a &quot;true&quot; Warder doesn't need to call on emote combat to be great.  If a Warder &amp;utruly&amp;n does his job, then his Aes Sedai will never be in a position where he will need to defend her life.  
Furthermore, you don't become great at emote combat out of wanting to protect &quot;her&quot;.  You become good at emote combat for a number of reasons, including control of grammar and ability to manipulate the English language, through a natural affinity for writing, or just practice.

      <text>First off, I'd like to let you know that I am the one filling in for the
immortal slot for you guys since Embreth wandered off. This isn't to say
that Alani and Fayth can't handle your issues, as we all know that they
would, but I'm technically filling the virtual shoes for now.

As far as that goes, I'm looking for someone to take up the immortal slot
and lead the warders, the band, and the Children. If you think you're the
right person, mail me and convince me of it. I purposefully leave out any
little things I want to know so that you will tell me what you think I 
should know. First quiz, you might say.

In addition to that, after all the old debating, there is no syllabus and
there are no ranks to move up. You come here to learn, you are ranked as
a trainee, and as Alani said, you stay that way until you opt out of the
little magical thing known as a bond or you land one, whichever suits you.
I encourage you to spar and play around, most importantly, I encourage
you to roleplay.

I have all of Embreth's old mail and there looks to be a great deal that
people had sent him and I'm not certain that he handled it or if members
started going to Fayth and Alani. If there are open issues that still
need to be resolved, feel free to spam my mudmail. I will try to be as
timely as I can in getting responses to you.

Above everything, have fun. We'll worry about the rest later.  :)

should be sent to me or whatnot. Tells, mudmail, email, my door is open to 
you all.
