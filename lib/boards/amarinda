      <text>Redo talent_board to list everything that is available or more
accurately, known to exist and then flagged as either available
or not through application.  Also point to helpfiles which explain
what each thing is, etc.

Sort by channie and nonchannie.
Sort by rarity: Rare, uncommon, common.  Something like that.

Possibly a &quot;statement&quot; helpfile or policyfile on what the talent
system's purpose or intention is.

Majority of the nonchannie stuff would likely fall under Special
Skills as opposed to actual Talents.  Limit per player on these?

Challenge being to tie whatever added skills we have to talent
code if only because we have no coding staff to speak of.

Also the idea of people that already have code skills that are
slated to become applicable Special Skills, or what not, should
apply anyways (like say they got said skills through their guild)
if they want to &quot;cement&quot; them into IC status.

Bleh, talentlist would need updating or maybe the new talent_
board would just replace it.

Hmm... I'll add anything I think of that is vaguely useful.
