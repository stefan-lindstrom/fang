      <text>I for one would like to see RP Quests offered on a more regular basis
here. I would like to see it daily, but since I think I've seen one,
maybe two offered in the past several months, I'll not hold my breath.

Some suggestions for RP Quests:

Events surrounding the upcoming tournament to be held in tear.

Parties hosted by the nobility.

Bubbles of evil

Holiday celebrations

Run-in with small parties of Trollocs or other shadowspawn

      <text>Radnor has some great ideas.  We could also have the gl's host rp quests whenever they were on, rp quests could be spur of the moment, 2 or 3 or 4 of them going at any one time.  this would greatly improve guild membership and interaction, let alone the bubble of evil idea would be great for those who are roaming caemlyn leveling, rp'ing is what this mud is about right?
Just my 2 cents, Morgan

      <text>First, let me say, &quot;Thank you Radnor&quot;.  Ideas like that are exactly why
I nagged Masema into putting in this board, for which we all owe him a
brief round of applause.  I'm currently trying to put together a series
of short quests on a few different plotlines, but in the meantime, I'd
love to continue to hear more ideas like Radnor's.  Even more than that
sort of list of ideas, though, I would love to have people come to this
board or to simply come directly to me with ideas for personal roleplay
activities.  Take the time to look at your roleplay and ask questions
like, &quot;How could this be better with an Imm's help?  What if we could get
someone to run some NPCs to oppose our plans?  Perhaps we could find a
way to involve the general public in our roleplay for a session or two?&quot;
If you come up with any ideas whatsoever, *please* give other people the
chance to help you bring them to fruition - really good roleplay tends
to come from the cooperation of multiple parties, where the unexpected
can create situations that would never happen while simply roleplaying
within one's own little clique.

      <text>Demian,

I'm glad to hear that you did host a quest. I did not know one was
run on Monday night.

However, I'd like to put in a voice for thos players who are not on
during the &quot;Prime Time&quot; of this mud. Yes, I know that most of the
playerbase is housed in the US. But this mud is not, and many players
are not. Considerations should be made to try to host an RP even during
these non &quot;Prime Times&quot; so that even more of the playerbase can be
reached and involved in such things.

And it is also my opinion that if only 1 or 2 people want to be 
involved in a quest, then the quest is worth running. Who knows, perhaps
after a few minutes other would like to involve themselves as well.

In the past, I've seen RP continue for hours as a result of a quest, I
would like to see the same once more here.

Etaine (aka Radnor)

      <text>I remember back in the day there were Quests that were
ongoing. A few players continuing with the same RP that
the Quest began with, and took it off on their own. At
an appointed time, the 'Quest' would begin again, only
now there were more involved, adding to the danger, the
mystery and the fun of the overall RP that had been
originally started. 
 
So my suggestion would be this(concerning RP quests)

If and when they do occur, have the 'subject' of the 
Quests(Ran by the same Imm) and on that particular
quest, be the same as the one prior. Set it for a certain
time(What's best for everyone currently involved) so
when the Quest is taking place, there are many players
that are able to be involved. For instance, every
Saturday evening at (such and such a time), that 
way people can plan ahead, and have something to look
forward too.
 
Me.

      <text>I'd like to take this opportunity to respond to Etaine and Madison and the
comments they have made about ways in which they would like to see quests
run, and the dynamics they would like to develop.  I think I have a pretty
solid basis upon which to make observation, having been in and run as many
roleplay quests as probably anyone else around here.

Small Group Quests - Need to have a strong theme and a group of people who
are previously invested in the story - i.e., people with an agenda.  This
is generally satisfied when people come to an Imm with a quest idea, but
rarely happens when an Imm simply gechos for quest participants.  If you
try to run a small group quest without that sort of situation, a couple of
relatively serious problems tend to crop up:
&amp;go&amp;n The plotline is immediately limited, since its hard to come up with
an exciting activity for two unrelated characters on the fly.
&amp;go&amp;n The Imm gets bored out of his/her mind by tedious tavern roleplay.
&amp;go&amp;n The Imm tends to feel like his/her time is being wasted on roleplay
which could quite easily occur without his/her assistance.
&amp;go&amp;n The people get bored with roleplay they could do any time on their
own, and are less likely to join future quests, perpetuating the problem.
The implications of these points for off-time roleplay are obvious.  Now,
I have in the past seen attempts made, and made a few myself, to arrange
off-time roleplay.  They tend to end in dismal failure, for the above
reasons.

Prescheduled and Ongoing Quests - Are virtually impossible to perpetuate.
I have done things of this sort many times, and there are 2-3 ways in which
those efforts invariably end:
&amp;go&amp;n People simply can't consistantly make it, and the participants at
later sessions don't get the plot.  Not enough people are involved to keep
the story meaningful, and it ends up being a wasted effort at continuity.
&amp;go&amp;n People simply don't care enough to commit their characters to any
sort of long-term activity in the first place.  I tried to get a group of
characters together for an IC &quot;Quest&quot; (over a period of time) during the
last summer.  I had a grand total of 1 positive response over the 3 weeks
the offer was on the board.  I was forced to drop it.

Now, here's the good news.  Most of these problems can be overcome by a
single very simple expedient.  Rather than expecting Imms to run around
in circles and try to anticipate the needs, desires, and enthusiasms of
the playerbase, morts can get together and come up with things they would
like to see, and bring a proposal to an Imm (especially me).  If you can
get an idea and a group together, I am more than happy to run it, because
I can focus on building a story around whatever framework you give me and
spend less time feeling like I am trying to herd cats into a room to go
IC and roleplay.

      <text>Mudmail me your character's name, his guild status, and some form of his
or her background(as short or as long as you'd like), and a brief summary
of where they are and what they are doing right now.
Describe to me the sort of roleplay you most enjoy, being as specific or
as vague as you would like.  I will look over the above information and
keep an eye out for you online.  If and when I see you, and I have the
time or inclination, I will offer to run roleplay for you starting from
wherever you are and whatever you're doing at that precise IC moment.  If
you're in an Inn's common room, or currently travelling between cities,
or literally anywhere else, I'll run you your own private roleplay quest.
Mind you, this is entirely at my own discretion, but it gives you a rare
chance to experience totally unplanned roleplay, which may be virtually
anything you can imagine(or rather I can imagine) tailored to what I know
about your character and your roleplay preferences.
But if you don't &amp;gsend&amp;n me anything, I can't &amp;grun&amp;n anything for you.  So get
on it, people!

My two cents into the mess. As we currently are moving towards a Tournament in Tear, or so I've heard, it'd be fitting to start having the appropriate RolePlay around it. Feasts, banquettes, a chance for increasing reputation in the Nobility or political plane, sponsorships... you name it. It could be all and everything you think is fitting or your characters would do. Everybody is moving around, the night is late and unknown people are mingling dancing on a Nobles mansion.... what could possibly go wrong?

      <text>Just an Idea, I heard mentioned that one of the problems with ongoing
quests is that people who join later don't know whats going on
So why don't we use this board to post ongoing quest summaries, so
people interestd in joining after it has started can get a general
idea of whats going on.

For Example Message topics could be Battle at Shadow Spire Part:I
or BM Tournament in Tear P:I etc... Then follow this with a short
description of what occurred during the quest, notable events, and
the participants.   (Pardon Spelling and Gramatical Errors)

      <text>Or we could ressurrect the use of 'gossip', which was originally intended
for exactly that purpose.  Either way, it's not a bad idea if people can
be enticed to actually use it consistantly...  I'd love to hear whatever
suggestions anyone might have on how to achieve that.

      <text>-Recent Thoughts on Thread (Multisession) RP- There are many MUs out
there, and each offers something different.  Hack'n'Slash, GodWaresque
dimensions abound, where our darker urges are channeled into fantasy,
destroying robots like the X-men in the danger room.  Fang, however,
offers the opportunity to define the depth of roleplay, with a fine and
-lengthy- set of novels as background.  Some times if I wonder if Robert
Jordan made a bet on his ability to write 10k page story.  This would
indicate something about the people on it, and their preferences in
storytelling.  -Initiating- One player submits an idea, or concept
proposal for a thread to either a Quest Imm or a (this?  ) board.  This
player is then responded to by the Quest Imm, or another authorized to run
the plot.  Any other players interested in this plot would send a
confirmation to the Thread Imm.  &quot;Blank&quot; proposals would include a brief
bit about the character's background, as well as the characters goals and
motives, and indicate an interest in being recruited by inspired Imms
looking for people to quest.  -Staging the Chapters- There would be two
kinds of chapters: - 1.  Live - An Imm is present for the RP, awarding
rolling QP at a regular interval, the quantity of which representing their
satisfaction, with something being standard.  For Chapters where the
Storyteller (ST) would like to be able to interact with the scene, or
would require NPCs.  - 2.  Logged - The interaction of the characters is
plausible, and not in a position to alter the ST's plotline.  Adding
colour and depth to character relationships and psyches.  In the middle of
Threads where the ST has left it at a pivitol or sensitive point, this may
be forbidden.  Log would be sent to ST instead of a GL, and awarded QP as
other logs.  Hopefully a player in each chapter will be willing to keep a
clean log of the Thread's chapters in .txt for reference.  -Using Mortal
Storytellers- Have Quest Imm approved proposals delegated to (or received
from) Mortal STs, who would basicly NPC and affect the scene as necessary,
sending a log in for QP as per usual.  More thoughts on this matter, will
wait for now.  Always willing to lend a limb.  ;) *Player* A.  Smith

      <text>Ummmm, yeah.  That's sort of the idea.  The thing is, Fang has proven in
the past that it doesn't need a sophisticated administrative system for
perpetuating roleplay.  If things have changed, or if the Mud as a whole
agrees that we should really change over to a system where ongoing
roleplay is generally subject to Storyteller oversight, then so-be-it.
But right now, that's not really the Mud we are, and I personally don't
see it in our future.  This shouldn't be taken to mean that there is a
limit to &quot;thread&quot; roleplay as you call it.  The general idea, though, is
that player can produce that themselves, without anyone holding their
hands.  I, and several other Imms, are always available to assist in the
production and perpetuation of ongoing roleplay threads...  But it is my
personal belief that it shouldn't be our business to manufacture them,
or to drag them along in any particular direction.  It is the business
of each player to find and maintain their own characters' paths...  and
to come to their fellow players for assistance support and inspiration,
when they have difficulty with that.
Then again...  it may be time for a change.  I haven't exactly received
a deluge of material from people looking to advance their roleplay lately.
Comments are welcome.  Requests for assistance with ongoing roleplay,
on the other hand, are actively solicited.  C'mon you slackers, get some
plots running.

      <text>how about hide and go seek. the imm restricts it to a city and
have a group of people be it and have them look for the other group
of people then switch it when everyone on the &quot;it&quot; team either gives
up or finds everyone on the other team.
It would make hide tracks alot more fun to have hide tracks
After the &quot;it&quot; group finds everyone or gives up (award points for the
people they did find) then switch the 2 groups and let the other
group have a go. If you are not found you get awarded qp for each
person in your group that was not found (including yourself)

Just an idea not to thought out but hey

      <text>   I think that it would be very interesting if a type of roleplay quest
was held.  This would be a different type, however, for questpoints would
not be the reward.  It would be fun if a character was created, and given
an interesting background and description and such, and then an object
(one definitely worth finding) was hidden somewhere on the MUD.  It has to
be obtained ICly, and the character that was created is the only one that
knows where it is ICly.  He could be slightly insane, however, and so many
of the clues he gives or the ramblings would point people in different
directions, and possibly serve to create roleplay in more unusual
situations and places.
