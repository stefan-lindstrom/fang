      <text>This is a fancy new type of board, a global board! Basically...it can be
used from anywhere in Fang..no matter what you're doing you can always
check this board, write to it, read from it, and if you're an imm, remove
posts from it (unless they're your own).

Its pretty straight forward. Basically it works like so:
gboard show (will give you a listing like typing &quot;look board&quot; normally)
gboard write &lt;Post Title&gt; (same as typing &quot;write &lt;Post title&gt;&quot; normally)
gboard read &lt;Post #&gt; (same as typing &quot;read &lt;Post #&gt;&quot; normally)

and for imms...
gboard remove &lt;Post #&gt; (same as typing &quot;remove &lt;Post #&gt;&quot; normally)

Thats it. Same paging rules apply when writing, and remove restrictions
for morts. (Mortals can only remove their own posts, imms can remove any
post as long as their level is above or equal to the level of the person
who wrote the post).

Enjoy folks :)

Anyways, what kind of board is this? An OOC board? An IC board?
An Ideas board? Or all of the above mashed into one big mixture?

That's all...

      <text>I don't really know, I never thought about that when I coded it :p

I guess it could concievably become a replacement for the OOC board...
or it could just be a global kinda announcement board.. *shrugs*

      <text>I know this sounds silly, but the idea caught with me.
If I get requests for 25 or more t-shirts, I can order a
batch of them, and that would cost about US$12 apiece PLUS post and package.
Mind you, it's not cheap to send things from Sweden...
The idea I had for them is a black t-shirt of fair to good quality with
that metal fang we have on our homepage (A4 sized) on the chest. That's it,
no text such as &quot;Dragons Fang&quot; or the like (I like simplicity and stylized things)
on it, just the fang.
Well...mail me at fredrik_lannergren@yahoo.com and tell me how many you'd
be interested in buying, and we'll see if we reach 25. We'll deal with the
money bit later, if the thing comes true.

PS. This is -not- designed to sponsor me or any new server or the like.
I won't make a dime from it; as a matter of fact, I'll probably lose money
since I'm such a soft hearted guy. This is just for kicks, you know? :)

Oh wait...


On a related note, I, Jonnas, Dreq and Quoten has posted three
posts on this board. And, if you include the post by Andruq
that makes four. That's a record!!! I think...

Well, at least someone is using this board.

      <text>Hey guys, could the coders increase the length of space that we can have
for our titles, as 80 characters isn't enough to fit alot of colour
changes in. I know we don't want huge titles, but I would like some more
colourful ones. Could a coder look into this please? Thanks.

      <text>And another thing, could the coders look into supplying a &amp;ybrown&amp;n colour,
as the closest thing we have I think is &amp;yyellow&amp;n. Any other colours that
could be added would be kewl 2. Thankee! :)

      <text>As some of you have found out already, the limits, or caps, on how much
Experience you gain on killing mobs have been changed a little.  As a
Newbie (that is level 20 or below), you now can gain a maximum of 500 exp,
which is the same as it always have been for those over level 20.  When
(or if ;) dying, you will now lose a maximum of 1000 exp if over level 20,
regardless of your character class.  As a Newbie, you won't lose any
Experience at all.  Hope this will make it easier for both Newbies and
more experienced players...
