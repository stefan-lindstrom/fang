      <text>Guildees,

I just wanted to touch upon a few issues, so please forgive me if I
begin to ramble.

OOC vs. IC:
The guild channels are OOC. What is said in tells is OOC. What I say
to you oocly is OOC. Are you getting the drift of it? Now what does 
this mean to you? It means that if we are discussing an RP situation 
that you are involved in, things brought up in the OOC conversation
that we are having should not be used to effect your IC situation. 
Granted, sometimes I might need things done on a case by case basis,
but I will be -very-, -very-, clear when I am making this kind of a 
request on you.

The DL syllabus:
For those of you non-DLs, the post is over unless you are just
curious as to what is going to be said. It is stated in the syllabus 
that the rules exist but given the nature of Dark RP, rules can sometimes
be broken. This doesn't mean you are automatically in the shit house. 
It just means if you get caught ICly, you are going to be in the IC 
shithouse. Which means what? Go ahead and do it if you think you aren't
going to get caught if you think it will further your machinations. Or
don't do it if you don't want Death or the Mistress of Pain knocking 
on your front door with a basket of balefire for you. 

Flames, comments, questions, etc. can me mudmailed to me or brought
up in tells.

Thanks,
Darith

      <text>This is Amarinda.. I feel like I'm in some kind of UFO sending a
transmission back home by fuckified radio.. weird.

Anyway, the plan. You have two other imms on your gchans. This
does not mean that Tabitha is no longer the guild leader here
because she is still very much that, and very much Shai'tan. But,
as posted on the OOC board, we have groups now. The Shadow is both
it's own and it's part of the rest. For this reason, a mort GL will
not be chosen here as Tabitha will be remaining and performing the
functions of a GL. However, you now have Alani and Tiekith around.
Alani is heading up the group of female channeling while Tiekith
is taking care of the male channeling. Does this mean you ignore
one of the three when something needs doing? No. Does this mean
that you go to Alani or Tiekith when Shai'tan starts knocking at
your door? Hardly. Basically, we have support positions. Use them.
If you have some questions about this, please see me.

      <text>The Dark One, the Great Lord, the Master of Death has been watching the
movements of his followers. The Master Dreadlord has been proven obscelete,
and has been removed... as well as most of the leadership. Only narrowly
did these individuals avoid death. Those who are worthy will be rewarded...
Those who are not, will be killed.
 
**tacked overtop of all the other postings, a huge black sheet despite
that the message is not very long**
 
OOC - Shai'tan's eyes are on each of you. As the message says, there will
be rewards, and there will be death. If you are summoned to Shayol Guhl,
assume it is the latter, and do not make plans to join the Dark again...
If Shai'tan has to kill you himself, he will know your reincarnation, and
to draw his attention back to you is to invite the worst kind of torment.

      <text>If you guys need something, please go to Alani or Tiekith. They will be
handling situations within these guilds for now.

That is all.

      <text>It was a quiet mid-morning at the Queen's Blessing as Jadene started her 
daily rounds to the inn's rooms.  She knocked on each door gently to see
if anyone was there.  If not, then she cleaned the room as she does 
everyday about this time. 

As she neared the last door of the hallway, it seemed quieter than usual,
atleast as she looks back on it.  But perhaps that's because she knows 
now what was on the other side of the door.  After no answer to the knock 
on the door, she opened it and took a step inside.  Seconds later, her 
screams reverberated through the hallway and even could be heard down 
in the common room below.  

Hurried footsteps could be heard as the Innkeeper as well as a few others 
rushed to see what was amiss.  With her hand over her mouth, muffling the 
screams that still tore its way from her throat, she pointed with her free hand.  
There, hanging from the rafters of the room, was the body of a young woman.  
Her long, blond hair partially covered the smooth skin of her face, ice blue 
eyes now covered with the veil of death as she swung slowly in the air.  

Her room held little details as to why this girl would kill herself, if in fact it 
was a suicide.  Among her possessions was a sealed letter addressed to a 
man named simply as Erick.
