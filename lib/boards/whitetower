An officer in the Tower Guard may NPC up to three guardsmen at his own
discretion. In emergency situations, he may call upon as many as is 
reasonable. These NPCs will not appear out of thin air. They need time to
arrive. Use common sense. You are all supposed to be excellent RPers, so
I'm sure you'll work it out.

Aes Sedai should not be NPC'd without previous authorization by either
Jaiana or myself EXCEPT in the case of an attack by an obvious male
channeler. Accepted, and even Novices, can be included in a link during
an emergency when one doesnt' have time to wait for calm, stately moving
Aes Sedai to show up and see what all the fuss is about. 13 women would be
more than sufficient whether they have reached the shawl or not. Again,
use common sense. There are over four hundred full Aes Sedai in this Tower
and likely twice that many accepted and light only knows how many novices.
But it still requires time for people to show up when a shout goes out.

Express permission is needed from the IMM GL (that'd be me) to use NPC
warders or sedai outside the Tower.

He was tried and found guilty of being one of those filthy male channeler
thingies. In accordance with the traditons, he was gentled. He is now
under the care of the Yellow Ajaha and forbidden to leave the Tower Grounds.

I'm now taking applications for the book character, Elaida. Check &quot;help
bookie&quot; for more details on what is needed in the app. But basically,
approach it as if you think I don't want you to have the character, and try
to convince me otherwise.

      <heading>Tue Feb  5 (Aidan)      :: Long Emote does not necessarily equal Good Emote</heading>

I have seen a trend in the past couple of years for people to assume that
the longer emote is always the better emote. This has lead, in many cases,
to people adding tons of extra, unnecessary junk into their emotes to
satisfy some perverse word count. I am not saying that short emotes are
better. What I am saying is that -better- emotes are better. Quality stands
on its own and is not dictated by length. I will not be nearly as verbose
as I usually am and just include two quick examples. And yes, I am often
guilty of this padding of emotes, as well.

Short emote:
&amp;c
Joebob steps towards Jimbob and thrusts his sword towards his chest.
&amp;n
Long emote (with other &quot;frills&quot; that supposedly enhance one's RP):
&amp;C
Jo'eb'ob arches his left eyebrow, then his right, until they form an almost
perfect 'V' on his wrinkled and tanned brow. His blue eyes glare icy
daggers at Jimbob as he glides towards him thinking how easy it will be to
cut the other man to shreds with his vastly superior skill. Reaching back
over his shoulders, he draws the twin blades sheathed there, then does a
quick pirouette on his left foot, right foot snapping up to his hip to draw
the long knife from his belt sheathe. As his twirling motion brings him 
around to face his opponent once more, he slashes at him with all three
blades, the sunlight glinting off the higly polished metal reminding him of
the flaxen hair of his lover with whom he has a tryst planned beneath the
moonlit sky this very evening.
&amp;n
Which emote is better is left as an exercise for the reader. I was in a
hurry so I didn't take the time to add color to those words which, for
truly great RP, needed it, such as &quot;flaxen&quot; and &quot;moonlit&quot;. Oh, I think 
flaxen hair is blonde, but to be honest, I'm really not sure. It's one of
those two dollar words, so it's good even if it doesn't mean what I think
it does.

      <text>Please take the time to work with seekers. We all want RP and we all
want the guild to shine. To do this we need to encourage people to
take part and if they wait a great deal of time, they lose interest.

Thanks,
Ama

I fixed a small bug in the script that makes the squirrels chitter. They
no longer chitter when other squirrels enter the room. As before, they
don't pester the novice or accepted mobs, either. They still chitter when
a player enters the room, though. But, unless someone is running back and
forth, they should no longer spam RP, since their own wanderings do not
cause spam.

      <text>The boards are in the process of being cleaned. If there's anything that has
been removed that you'd like to see, mail it to me or repost it yourself. The
other guild boards are going through the same process, and the same thing 
applies there. New posts will be appearing in the next few days, so you might
want to check them out.

As a side note, you may not be aware that Fayth is functioning as GL for both
the White Tower and Rebel Tower. This means that anything you would normally
tell your GL, lesson notification and such, should also be mailed to her.
Lets make use of her while we have her, mmkay?

Also, I am available if you have anything you'd like to talk about, be it 
comments, concerns, random thoughts, ideas, whatever. I'm here to help as much
as I can.
