      <text>Just a bunch of really cool CotL sayings I picked up and
adapted from a variety of sources, something to spice
up your rants..... I mean speaches.

-Darkfriends commit two crimes.  The first is turning from
the path of the Light, and the second is the embrace the Darkness
through which they tread.  For the first, they may be forgiven,
if they return to Walk in the Light.  For the second, there
is only death.

-Your honor is your life, let none despute it.

-An empty mind is like unto freshly turned sod.  If not sown
with the seeds of love, duty, and honor, the insidious
weeds of heresy take root.

-Darkfriends have only one purpose and there is nothing they
will not do to accomplish this, no matter how vile or loath-
some it might be.  These abominations mean to destroy
everything proud and noble, everything we hold dear and
have fought so long to achieve.

-Thought begets Heresty, Heresy begets Retribution.

-The Dark One has many forms.  You must know them all.  You must
tell the Dark One from his disguise and root him from the hidden
places.  Trust no one.  Trust not even yourself.  It is better
to die in vain than to live in abomination.  The zealous martyr
is praised for his valor, the craven and the unready are justly
abhorred.

There's a sample, if anyone wants more, mail me or post here.

I have come across some disturbing news. It there is a new threat in the world
the &amp;KSeanchan&amp;w. WE must be wary, the can control female channelers by use of
some kind of chain, and have recentally attacked in Ebou Dar. We must be wary
and i would advise an occupying force to enter Ebou Dar and make our presence
known. I shall be recieving more information shortly and i will keep you all
posted.&amp;n

      <text>In the Light,
   On my patrols in Caemlyn I came across a foul group of people....a full half dozen of them who proceeded to verablly abuse and accost me for no apparent reason. I proceeded to question them closely, it was my intention to ascertain whether they walked the path of the light and were misguided mayhap, or whether they had fallen into the shadow.

   I was ATTACKED! These fools attacked me, a true Child of the Light in the middle of Caemlyn. When it almost came to a fully fledged sword fight, the Queen's Guard's finally came along and they surrounded us all.

   I rejoiced, because while the Queen's Guard's have oft-times in the past seemed critical of us, the Children of the Light, they have always abhored any violence in their city.

   So what did the shadow tainted fools do?! They proceeded to allow those half-dozen men and women to go FREE! AND THEN THEY GROUPED UP AND SURROUNDED _ME_!!! DECLARING ME THE ANTAGONIST OF THE ENTIRE SITUATION!

   I quite rightfully expressed my most vocal and adamant denial of that accusation and then they proceeded to advance upon me, murder in their shadow tainted gaze. Caemlyners looked on in fear as they watched the Queen's Guard's attack me for nothing, until another of my squad stationed in Caemlyn *desc unamed*, came to my aid.

   At that point we reacted in unison and I took two of those foul miscreants out with two fell swipes of my light guided sword before taking a third in the chest. Two more that were arrayed against me attacked and I moved, relieving them of their knee caps.

   Only the first two were mortally wounded while my compatriot battled against another volley of guards who had hesitated to their err between returning to attack me again and meeting him. One more fell to a hamstring from my squad man before we fleed these obvious darkfriends presence for surely the sounds of approaching reinforcements was ringing foully in the air.

In the light, always,
  Lethan Mosen.

      <text>The Children of the Light are at war with forces too
terrible to comprehend.  We cannot afford mercy for
any of its victims too weak to take the morally correct
course.  Mercy destroys us, it weakens us, and saps
our resolve.  Put aside all such thoughts.  They are
not worthy of Soldiers in the service of the Light.
Praise the Creator for in our resolve we reflect His
purpose of will.

Protestations of Innocence Prove Nothing.

The weak will always be lead by the strong.  Where the
strong see purpose and act, the weak follow.  Where
the strong cry out against the Pattern of the Wheel,
the weak bow their heads and succomb.  There are many
who are weak, and many are their temptations.  Despise
the weak for they flock to the call of the Shadow.  Pity
them not and scorn their cries of innocence- it is
better that one hundred innocents fall before the swords
of the Light than one kneel before the Dark One.

Victory needs no explaination.  Defeat allows none.

Huddle close to your False Dragon if he makes you feel
safe.  He cannot save you, for only the Light is eternal.

For Questioners only:
  Why struggle?  Your soul will feel so much better when
we're finished.

Also for Questioners only:
  I am not asking for your blood.  I can -take- your
blood.  I am asking for your soul.  Only you can return
your soul to the Light.

For those losing fights:
  The dark tide of Shadowspawn is upon us, and we are
alone.  There can be no mercy, no surrender.  If we
survive this day it will be a miracle.

There can be no bystanders in the battle against the
Shadow.  Anyone who will not fight by our side is an
enemy to be crushed.

Want more?  Let me know.  I'm only about halfway through.
-Kazin.

      <text> The Prophet and his mobs are at it again!  They push across our northern
 border and burn everything they come close to!  They are a seething mass
 of Lightforsaken Darkfriends all!  Our soldiers seem to have no success in
 pushing them back across into Ghealdan, but luckily, they seem more intent
 on looting and burning the outlying villages than actually pressing a full advance
 into the heart of Amadicia, to Amador itself.  But this can't last, this foul
 Prophet must be stopped, purged from our blessed lands, before he can spread
 his lies and chaos further.  Something must be done, our troops seem to only
 have success in distracting them, much less defeating them.  If the opinion
 of a low ranking individual, such as myself, were valued, I'd venture it's time
 we stop treating the Prophet as a joke, and more like a genuine threat to Amadicia!

      <text>Fellow Children,

With a heavy heart, I report that a body found appears
to be that of Lord Inquisitor den Balgar.  Though the
remains were hard to identify, this is our best guess.
It can only be thought that this is an act of hate
against the Children and the culprit must be brought to
justice.  Any and all information will be rewarded.

      <text>While returning from delivering dispatches today, I was 
informed by a light fearing citizen of Caemlyn there was 
an odd man at the Golden Bowl inn.  Upon arrival I discovered 
a man *desc of Cordell* with eyes that appeared to yellow at 
table. To my surprise there was also a man who claimed to be 
a Child of the Light *desc Leon* going by the name of Child 
Atreides. Child Atreides and I approached this man who had 
obviously given his soul to the Dark one, thus accounting for 
his yellow eyes.  When requested to come with us, the man 
refused. Upon questioning him there, I found his name to be 
Lord Cordell Fenevall, of House Damodred.  Since I am personally 
not familiar with House Damodred, I can neither attest to the 
validity of his claim or not.  Since Child Atreides or I could 
not be sure, we requested again that he come with us.  However 
at that moment, another man entered *desc Asin*, it is at this 
point that I have very sad news to report.  Child Atreides broke 
ranks and ran.  I do understand what I write here, and I swear 
under the light and with my salvation to the light, that this 
is true.  Since, I have never seen such cowardliness in our 
ranks before
I do not believe this Child Atreides was truly 
one of our own.  After the false Child of the Light ran, my 
options were very limited, because it became very apparent that 
this man *desc Asin* would aid Lord Fenevall.  I viewed it more 
important to deliver the news, of both men, and the traitors 
Child (if he truly be a Child of the Light at all). 

The light illumine us all,

      <text>Well. I read your posts and I must say the beard I am growing is
way cool. 
I am not currently starting any plots, but I am brewing sake at
home and I must say it's pretty potent this time.
I am not around that much due to other commitments but during the
day I will always be available to turn down rp if contacted at the
following:
rodb@hayesknightqld.com.au
I might not turn it down if it's over lunch or specifically relates
to mudsex.

Is Wuan Greg or Pete?

What you witnessed was merely the acorn. With some care and

And by oak I mean way cool beard.

      <text>&amp;wDisguise.

This skill will be given to the guild spies/assains only. So they will be able to disguise their names for roleplay only. The skill is also given on a trust basis that it will be used properly and for IC purposes. 

here are a few rules to follow.

1. disguise must be only used in an IC manner. Using disguise to make up non IC names ,bookies names and any other popular character from tv, books ect. will not be tollerated.


2. No dramatic changes to a Guildies descrition. eg. You cannot make yourself thinner. you cannot change your eye color and so forth. Weight cannot be changed.Height cannot be changed and neither can one's eye color. Scars birth marks and so forth may be disguise by the use of makeup, that is if your character knows how to do that.

3. There are certain races that you cannot disguise to be.
Such are as follows:

Aiel
Seachan
Seafolk
Ogier.

Any Breaking of these rules will result in punishment. So please use the skill in a logical manner.

Angua.

people dressed in black who were channelers &lt;desc saada&gt; &lt;desc Rylin&gt;
&lt;desc Jephrey&gt;.  Child Collard (Percevul) came in and I motioned for him
to check out the people in black.  As I was trying to steady the drunk the
people in black were incredibly hostile to Child Collard.  I gave up on
the drunk and I called for Child Collard to join me at the table.  As he
came over he tripped, I suspect due to one of the channelers.  Child
Collard attempted to draw his sword and I suggested he leave but the
Channelers disabled him before he could.  The Queens Guard left earlier
but returned and the Channelers told him that Child Collard provoked them!
The Queens Guard apparently took their word over Child Collard's and has
arrested him with one of those dirty channelers helping him.  I suggest
that something be done immediately to get Child Collard free of that
shadow tainted city.

      <text>Okay peeps.  I went ahead and did Angua a small (hah!)
favor and redid the entirity of your GUILD EQ.  Basically
I streamlined the stats and changed the descs into stuff
that isn't so hard on the eyes (although this GEQ is also
toolable).

Couple things, anyone with old GEQ will notice that I
changed the short descs (IE: when you type &quot;eq&quot;) so
that they alert you to come ask for new GEQ.  Not
only did I change the short descs, I also flagged all
the old stuff !SAVE (except for the Gcontainers, calm
down) mostly due to the fact that there has been
some problems with old CotL GEQ floating around where
it shouldn't be (like on mobs, etc.).  Oh yeah, I also
removed the stats (aside from the capacity of the
Gcontainers that is).

As I said, the GEQ is toolable, but Angua is the one
who will tell you whether or not she really wants it
altered.  In fact, she may even end up redoing a lot
of the descs I wrote so that they correspond with ranks
like they should-- like she wants it.

I wrote a fairly complete Ghelp file detailing the GEQ as
it is now.  Please check it out: GHELP 1 NEW_GEQ.

Direct any complaints to me, for this was all my doing.

If you need a new GEQ set, just ask me or Angua or
even Arif!

That is all.

Masema
PS- This was mostly done out of sheer frustration with
the previous set of GEQ... Ugh.  The stats.. the utter
confusion!  I'm still going through the healing process.
I'll be alright, just give it time.  *mutters about all caps
on short descs under his breath*

      <text>I have, as an experiment, swapped your call mobs (those that
appear when you type reinforce) for retainers.
This means that reinforce no longer exists as a command, but is only
used to check whether you can get the retainers. If you don't have the
skill, you can't, obviously.
These &quot;guild retainers&quot; are bought at the same place as all the rest;
oval, s, 2e.
They don't cost anything to buy and they don't impose any rent either;
they're totally for free.
In addition to this, they have IC as well as OOC power (just as much
as the old call mobs), so you can individualize these henchmen and
give them eq etc just like any other retainer.
There is one limit to this however; you cannot get more than four of 
these &quot;special type retainers&quot;. This to avoid _too_ much cheating.
Also, Arif and Angua determine whether _all_ the rules pertaining to
this new toy. If they say you can't play with them even though you have
the skill, you cant't, period.
Confused? Ask Arif and Angua. If they can't answer, _wait_ until they get
some word from the immies, don't go behind their backs to get quick
answers.
Remember, this is a trial run. If all goes well, all call mobs will be
swapped for equivalent-strength retainers. If not, they won't...which applies
to your darling call mobs as well. Mess this up and you can kiss these
free retainers goodbye.

I am making a little post to let everyone know that Angua is no 
longer with us as our GL.  I personally think she did a great job 
and she will be missed.  Although her departure causes some pain 
in our hearts because this lose is a friend and GL please do not 
fear. We still have a GL (me) and Hartigan has always shown our 
guild love and will continue to do so in the future.  For you 
hardcore RP's who like to send in logs.  Send them to me and I will 
make sure you receive your coveted qp's.  Angua is keeping her alt's 
and if you know them please let her know that she is missed.

&amp;r
We are putting the soldiers into legions so there can 
be a little more RP action for you boys and girls.  
What does this really mean?  Not much other then you 
will now know who to report to in the chain of command.  
The basic overview is the Children will have 2 legions 
of soldiers, HotL, and Ambassadors.

Good news all... The legions are complete and ready to see some action.  What does this mean for everyone?  Not a big change other then the fact that now you will know whom the next man in the chain is for your legion.  Making it a little easier to RP with officers and the likes.  In the future it will also allow us to hold little tournaments among ourselves.  I am also going to try and get 3 clubs set up for us.  2 for the legions and one for the Hand.

The legions shall be as follows:

&amp;nLegion name:  &amp;rCalcon&amp;n (Red Banner)
&amp;gOfficers
&amp;nEamon &amp;gLord Captain
&amp;nWuan &amp;gSecond Captain 
&amp;nFilarchi &amp;gHundredman
&amp;cSoldiers
&amp;nVormav &amp;cFile Leader
&amp;nIsaac &amp;cSoldier
&amp;nGardoan &amp;cSoldier
&amp;nLexyz &amp;cSoldier

&amp;nLegion Name:  &amp;YCaircon&amp;n (Gold Banner)
&amp;gOfficers
&amp;nArif&amp;g Lord Captain
&amp;nEsbjorn&amp;g Second Captain
&amp;nJanos&amp;g Under-Lieutenant
&amp;cSoldiers
&amp;nSam &amp;cFile Leader [Enlisted]
&amp;nCohen &amp;cSoldier [Enlisted]
&amp;nLeon &amp;cSoldier [Enlisted]
&amp;nIsharahien &amp;cRecruit [Enlisted]

&amp;nLegion Name: &amp;RGarak and the D-Street Thugs
&amp;gOfficers
&amp;nGarak&amp;g Lord Inquisitor
&amp;cSoldiers
&amp;nAronger &amp;cSoldier [Enlisted]
&amp;mSpecial
&amp;nCheron &amp;mSpy [HotL]

&amp;nWhat does this mean for everyone at the moment?  Simply that the Enlisted will be removed from you guild rank and switched with the correct legion you are now in.  I should have this completed for everyone soon.  Also the D-Street Thugs legion name will be switched to whatever they wish to be called.

      <text>Hey yous mugs.  Just letting you know if you want something
done for your guild and Arif isn't around, hit me up.  I'm
making an effort to help Amarinda out with a couple guilds and
I just can't get enough of you crazy kids! *pinch*

Right!  Also wanted to say that if you have any roleplay logs
that you haven't been awarded for (not in terms of rank adv-
ancement, that's more Arif's bag) then you should send them
to me and I'll fling out the QPs.

Seekers!  You guys are doing fairly well I'd say in picking up
recruits and roleplaying with them, etc etc but if you want to
help speed up those types of things, have seekers send both
Arif and I their BGs and I can help out in that respect.

You guys should also know I can do all the nifty GL commands
and shtuff like that too so if you need something set on you or
maybe a GEQ switch or something, also let me know.

Requests!  Anything you guys want done on the Imm side of
things?  Something?  Maybe?  That maybe Arif can't do?
Lemme know.

I believe that's all for now.  Seeyuh!

CotL (again).  We don't currently have an imm gl right now, so I'll
pretty much be in charge of all guildwork that goes on around here.
We have a lot more momentum going for us as a guild right now then
we've had for a while, so lets not lose that.  We need to go out
and recruit, recruit, recruit.  Having a good, active guild is 
everyone's resposability. You all know that this is the best guild
around, lets show everyone else what they're missing.

Lemme know if you need anything from me.  Mudmail or email at

We have a new Seeker who I see as really into getting into the guild
I think he has what it take to become a good CotL. He does not show
any hesitation when I warned him about how people don't like us an he
knew so I say we get him all the sponsors we can...though this is his
first alt I see potential so let get to what Esbjorn wants us to do

cringe, however, when I think of what his roleplay will be like, given the

Just writing a post to see if anyone would like to swordspar with me.
I am looking for any and all I can find (Friendly of course).
In addition to really helping me out it will help with everyone's
ranks. I will more than likly recommend anyone who is willing to help
me. That make you tops with me. Not to alienate any one but it would
seem right to make a spacific request to the Legion I am in.

Hey Calcon I am looking to improve my swordfighting ability and I need
your help send me mudmail if you are willing to spar with me.
I already have Limzorn read to help and I know with a few spar he
will be better and he will move up in the world (Icly of course)
Thanx for your help guys

      <authorname>Esbjorn</authorname>
      <text>&amp;wAt ease men. :P  As you may have noticed, I added a ghelp file entitled
'&amp;GArmy_Rank_&amp;_File&amp;w' (You need two of these '&amp;&amp;' to get it to work right if
you are bored enough to type out the whole name.)  This outlines what
each individual rank is responsible for in the Army, so if you were
wondering just what your rank meant, here is where you find that info.

Now, some of you &amp;WRules Lawyers&amp;w (you know who you are) will instantly
realize that the chain of command differs somewhat from what's outlined in
&quot;&amp;WThe World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time&amp;w&quot; Well, this is for two
reasons. Firstly, I wanted to give very specific information on the
standard command tree and unit division in the Army, with which the &amp;WBWB&amp;w
(Big White Book) was not very helpful, and lastly, the chain of
command given in the &amp;WBWB&amp;w was very counterintuitive and all together
sucky.... in my opinion. :D (Ex. Bannerman being of much Higher Rank than
File Leader, while File Leaders are somewhat akin to Sergeants, and 
Bannermen are people who run around with banners.) So that's the reason
for that. :P

Also, it should be noted that the larger of these divisions are mainly in effect 
during wartime, and even then they usually only group as such on the battlefield.
The most common divisions when the Army is not on the battlefield are that of: 
&amp;WPatrols&amp;w, which patrol the streets of occupied cities and towns; &amp;WPlatoons&amp;w which 
patrol the surrounding countryside; and &amp;WCompanies&amp;w, which make small camps in 
the open field. In peacetime the Army still trains in it's larger divisions 
every so often, as to be prepared in the event of battle.

Anyway, since this file focuses more on ranking than division structure I 
think I'll add another ghelp on &amp;u&amp;WArmy Divisions&amp;n&amp;w, for clarification.&amp;n

      <text>&amp;wI also gave the rank list a much needed cleaning, in addition to adding
and deleting some ranks. Anyone who has had their rank drasticly changed
should have recieved a mudmail from me, save all you recruits who's sub
ranks I took away.  I decided that it's too early in your training to have
to choose what route you want to take in your advancement, so your
subrank may come back upon your graduation from being a recruit.

Also, I'd like to clear something up about the Bannerman rank.  It is
now an elective rank, that means that you &amp;Wdo not&amp;w have to achieve
that rank to advance through the Army's promotion ladder. The Bannerman
rank is something that you apply for as a Soldier, and is given 
out, or not, with the factors of IC merit and availability in mind.

The same holds true for First Bannerman, but that rank is comperable
to File Leader instead of Soldier.

A complete advancement syllabus is in the works for the near future.

Its been quite a while since I've been last on, but believe me when I say it was something out of my control. I will try my best to be on regularly from now on as Jace, who always has been my favorite alt. For those of you who do know my other alts, I may be logging on to them on occasion, but I will mainly be focusing on Jace and the CotL.
It feels good to be back. If anyone wishes to RP, I'm usually more then happy to. I'm can't wait to see all you oldies again, and am looking forward to meeting the fresh meat...um...I mean respected recruits.

Always in the Light

      <text>Hi!  I was wondering if you guys read our guild-gossip thing.
Actually..er.  &quot;cotlrumor&quot; to read it btw.  But I was also
going to suggest maybe giving out gossip privs to more peeps
since.. well I dunno when last something was written in there.
Like Cheron for instance could write about the goings ons in
Ghealdan since there's prolly some filthy Dragonsworn out
there in need of &quot;saving&quot;.  I know we have IC posts on this
board and even on the Caemlyn IC board but I thought it
might be something neat since I think people largely forget about
it as a tool for roleplay.  Uhh... Oh like too, the spies can write
stuff, stuff that they wouldn't necessarily communicate in
roleplay and so forth, remember it's rumors and gossip and
doesn't really have to be true so.  Anyways that's my little idea.
Er, it's not abundantly original though but... I'm just a grunt
afterall.

      <text>We have a cool house!  It's like.. a beach house.  Sort of.
Except without the beach part.  Details.  Anyways, Esbjorn,
Jace and I were scanning this board and pondering things
and I figured I (one of us) should post because it seemed
to be forgotten.
Safehouse directions: recall; u; n; w; 6s; e; n
And just because, the encampment outside of Caemlyn:
recall; u; n; w; s; 14s; e; 4s; e; 9s; w; 3s; w; 4s; w; 10s; 2w; 2s; e; 4s; e; 4s; w; 17s; w; se; 2e; ne 

Wow.  I think I'll alias that one.
Oh yeah!  Our cool safehouse, unlike Filarchi's debatably cool
beard, has a neat little board where you can tack up info on
known Darkfriends.  Consider it a &quot;CotL Most Wanted List&quot;.

Walk in The Light,

      <text>I would just like to point out! Conner spelled the word &quot;wrong&quot;
incorrectly!  And furthermore! I copied those directions from
Angua's post so... And I still can't see a difference between
her directions and mine so! I am not at fault and thus I shift
the blame to Angua or simply to the idea that Conner can't
read because he certainly has trouble spelling!  Hmft.

      <text>Hey guys, from now on I'd really like it if when you send me in
those great RP logs, you'd have the subject read &quot;CoTL RP: Name, Name, ect...&quot;
The name part, of course containing all the names of the &amp;WCotL&amp;n
members that took part in the RP, including your own character. As you can
imagine, my email is getting pretty confusing with all those logs that
keep pouring in.

And on that note, everyone is doing a -great- job.  I really mean it.
RP activity is what keeps a guild alive, and right now I can safely say
that our guild if one of the -best- guilds out there. And that's entirely
due to you guys, and your awesome work ethics.  I can tell you
love this guild as much as I do and that really makes my efforts to
keep this guild going worthwhile. I can't thank you enough...

And on that note, keep it up!  We need more recruits, because the more
recruits we have, the safer I feel promoting people, so if you go out
and do seeker RP, not only are you helping yourself to meet your log
req, you are also getting more recruits in, which might let me
fudge the log req a little. ;)

      <text>Hey all just posting to tell you all that I still put out the offer
for swordsparing be it wether to teach you the basics or to get my
butt handed to me does not matter to me. Yes these swordspars are not
to the death they are for all to come and learn, teach...the out come
is the same I learn new styles and so do you plus it helps in the
rank process, and if we keep it up and we get into a little
transgretion (can't spell) or a war we will be well prepared to take
any army on.
So come out and spar with me or anyone for that matter. Let me be your
stepping stone and let me use you for mine. In other words you
scratch my back I scratch yours.

      <text>You may be wondering why Esbjorn has a nobility title now, and here is
the answer.  Esbjorn and Lord Haral Algoran have arranged a marrage
between Esbjorn and Lord Haral's.... 'lovely' daughter.  Some may doubt
Esbjorn's motivations for this marrage, but he will assure you that
after a rather... brief courting period the couple has fallen very much
in love...  This has nothing to do with Esbjorn's ascent to nobility, or
the wealth we stands to inherit as a member of House Algoran... really.

Anyway, I was pondering making the marrage an IC event, and thought I'd
post to see if any of you guildies have any interest in attending.
It really doesn't matter to me, so don't respond for my sake.  I just
thought I'd ask if anyone was interested, so if you are interested in
attending the wedding, just send me a mudmail saying you are. If I don't
get an adaquate amount of responses then I just won't worry about setting
the whole thing up and Esbjorn will just have to celebrate his good
fortune alone. :)

Soon-to-be Lord Esbjorn Sunblad of House Algoran.

      <text>As you may or may not have read the OOC board, there are things changing
in guild administration. However, after discussion it was decided that
nothing will be changing here within the CotL. So don't think Esby is
going anywhere or that there's suddenly more people on the gchan. Things
continue on like they have been. And I must say, this is a great guild
and already has a great leader.  :)

      <text>I know this has been said to death, and thought probably even more, but the guild really has become a shadow of the splender it once was. Esby did a good job of organizing this guild, and we were, at a time, the most active guild on this MUD. I'm sure everyone has some reason or another to why they haven't been on their CotL alt lately, but what is in the past can't be changed. What can be changed is the future, and the future of the CotL, and that can only be done when people to become active parts of this guild again. I will do my best to be here as much as possible and will do all I can to get RP in this guild flowing again, and I hope you all will too. So get out there and raid the oval or Half Moon, cause some trouble, get arrested, shake things up a bit.

      <text>As the title implies, this is a key moment for the guild and
it's members.  This is not something to go without notice.
I suggest you all go to the Amador IC board and read
the latest post because... The Seanchan have landed, my
friends.  The Fortress of Light has tumbled like a house of
cards before them.  The Children of the Light have scattered
and fragmented into small bands, refugees, homeless, and
without a nation to call home.  No allies but the men they
stand beside wherever they find themself.

What this means to you:

You have a choice, you can continue to roleplay as though
nothing has happened, and look stupid, or you can take this
stuff into account.  I don't think you guys are stupid...

To further clarify:  Valda is on the run, and if I remember right
it is said he has a company of something around... nine-hundred
running with him by the time he meets up with the Questioners
in the prologue of Crossroads of Twilight.  So we can assume he
started out with a bit more, having lost numbers during battles
with the Seanchan.  You can take your character that way, or
you can also become an Oathtaker.  I'm not suggesting these
are your only options, but I wanted to make sure you guys thought
about these things.  I mean, a lot of you are in or near Caemlyn
where you might not be affected directly just yet, but if nothing
else, reports NEED to reach you and you need to incorporate it
into your character in some fashion.  Like, be -more- angry or
something.  Oh yeah, if I'm wrong about the numbers Valda has
by the prologue of book ten, someone please correct me, I'm
about to head out to work and don't feel like looking it up.

Post in response!  I need to know what you guys think/feel about
this stuff.  Mail me, mail Esbjorn (where the heck is Esbjorn?!), make
sure I hear your cries of oppression!  I mean.. since, the Seanchan
are oppressing you.. not.. me.  No.  Anyways!

      <text>I'd appriciate it if every CotL member could send me a mudmail detailing
exactly where you are ICly, so I have a clear idea of where everyone is
when the seanchan sacking took place. I have been stationed in Caemlyn for
a while ICly, and I assume a large number of Caircon are with me, but ultimatly
your IC position is up to you. So anyway, mudmail me with you location and
what you have been doing lately.  If you have any trouble with this
speak to/mail me and I'll help.  We must try to organize our remaining
numbers in these harrowed time. With out a beacon of Light to follow, all will
be flooded with darkness.
