the seal on it bears no sigil*

My Lord,
I thought you should know about a man who may be a danger to you.
I do not believe he is an enemy, in fact, he seeks to join you.  The other
night, he engaged in conversation with one of your members at a public
place.  He spoke quite plainly of his intent to join you within the 
range of hearing of a number of your enemies.  If the man is not already
dead, he may have caused trouble for you and yours.  Your member handled
the situation fairly, and I do not believe suspicion was aroused.  However,
I urge you to seek this man out and deal with him appropriately.  A
danger to your cause who is on your own side is as good as an enemy.

I pray the Light shine upon you, and may the Hand of the Creator shelter
you.

      <text>A witch on the loose in Amador!  She is a proven wielder
of the accursed One Power and she goes by the name
of Tayla.  Last seen she was being pursued by a patrol
of Children however she was lost in a crowded public
area.  Lord Captain Arif has expressed great interest in
her capture, as well as Second Captain Esbjorn.  The last
to have seen her were Child Isaac and the File Leader of
Caircon, Gant.  If any information is known about this
woman, it is to be made known immediately to the above
Captains.  (followed by a brief description of Tayla)

OOC:  This is a PC character, Tayla, although I don't think
she logs in often, however! Her player is Paige.. I think I can
say that?  So if there is any sort of scheme with her in mind
I would suggest getting in touch with her.

      <text>We have a new canidate going by the name of Nosfer
A number of our members have talked with this man and 
he appears worthy of becoming a Child. As soon as I recieve 
confirmation from command I shall bring him to camp to begin
his training. Find and tell me if you have any comments on this man
who currently recides at the Half Moon Inn.

      <text>These two individuals are wanted for murder and are
known Darkfriends: (poster depicting Varak and Tarrin).
Be warned!  They have the golden eyes and command
the company of fierce wolves through their blasphemous
pact with the Dark One.

(no signature)

OOC: This was salvaged off an old post from the CotL
guild board and I put it here since these characters still
exist and are (I think) still roleplayed from time to time.

      <text>A parchment has been laid on the desk, left open, addressed to Lord Garak
Tain..

Cheron Katranna, the barmaid from the Golden Bowl, has died at the hands
of the Seanchan in Amadicia.  She had been visiting her hometown of Sehar
in Ghealdan, and crossed into Amadicia around the time of the invasion.
Her escort, Captain Vlemar Ratelin of the Queen's Guard, accompanied her
there, where both met up with the Seanchan forces.  He was able to bring
her back to Sehar where they both died of their injuries.
