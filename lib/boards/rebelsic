      <text>Introduction to the Rebel Tower IC Board.

I do not want &amp;Rflames&amp;n of any kind on this board. It is meant only
for IC notes and information. Modifications have been added so that
it is a guild only board, meaning that the WCs and Taint Boys can no
longer post to it. &amp;RAll&amp;n OOC information needs to go on the board
in the guildwalk room. Keep the information strictly IC when posting
here. It's creation was for this purpose and this purpose only. If
you post OOC notes, it will be removed.

      <text>The Guards of Salidar have been lax, it seems.
Far too often, I have seen Men and Woman who claim to live by the Sword stumbling about
Calling, crying, and making disturbances.  This is not how one should act.
Especially one who wishes to be a Warrior.
May it be known, if you are found Intoxicated, you will be dealt with.
May the Light Guide, and Creator shelter.

      <text>There was an incident involving two of these so called Asha'man
coming through a gate into our park. They were quickly apprehended
by a fellow Gaidin and surrendered their weapons. They appeared to
have been drinking at the time but were taken. They were taken to
a farm house and will reside there until decisions are made. They
are under guard and have been safely shielded. They will remain so
at this time.

Terynn Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah

&amp;YOOC Note&amp;n - Rikard and Zohar of the BT gated in and were captured.
Their RP needs to take place in Logain's house and there are NPC Sedai
holding the shields. Most likely each time, there would be a lot of
Aes Sedai in the house with them not to mention warders. They were
guilded in as prisoners and will remain that way until RP with Egwene
and/or the Hall dictates they are to be released/gentled. Have fun!!

reflected upon the somewhat odd conversation between Aes Sedai Celline and
Renner.    

It is said that the two began a polite conversation and that somewhere
within the conversation, things turned a bit heated. Renner was 
seen preparing to depart Salidar for what he called a trip, while
Aes Sedai Celline briskly departed the common room.

      <text>Sometime last night a Sister left our fold in the peacefulness of her
sleep.  She was found in her chambers, among the books she so loved, by a
novice who was helping her with some research.  The Brown was one of the
oldest, and though a bit reclusive was said to be liked by many.  
Tragically, the Sister was last known to be holding the bond of Alton
Gaidin, whose whereabouts were last rumored to be in the borderlands.  
Little is known of the mans condition, but last reports say he was
unbalanced and dangerous.
May the Light be with us all.

      <text>Let the proclamation be heard that the Hall of the Tower has come
to the decision and has summoned Raina Aes Sedai, Mistress of Novices,
Green Ajah, to appear before them shortly, in accordance with Tower
law and those present.

Let it also be known that the prisoners, the Asha'man, will be brought
before the Hall and the Tower in accordance with proper Tower law and
mandates, to answer for their crimes and be dealt with as they should be.

Let it also be known that Menarra Aes Sedai has been summoned as well,
to come before the Hall on matters that have not been made public.

It should also be heard that the novice book has been opened to
all those that can channel. Upon declaration by the Amyrlin Seat,
the Flame of Tar Valon, undisputed by the Hall of the Tower. Women,
all women, that have the ability to channel or have the ability to
learn, will be brought and tested.

Furthermore, all ties to the Black Tower, as it is known, will cease.
The treaty previously in place has been broken by the two Asha that
are currently being held. It is seen to have been broken by them, not
on the account of the Aes Sedai of this tower, members of the Salidar
community.

Any disputes or questions can be directed to the Sitters of the Tower.
It is those women that have spoken.

      <text>Salidar seems more quiet than usual these past few days. The
sounds of children's laughter about are not as prevalent as they
once were. No signs have been seen of the three five year olds that
are usually being chased by their Nanny, Faelen, Wulfstan and Kalia.
Nor has any sign been seen of Etaine, Sitter of the Green or her
Gaidin since she was last seen conversing with Anibelle in Salidar
Square. The sounds of Ra'shads hammering have been noticeably absent
from the Blacksmithy.

      <text>Word has arrived from Caemlyn today that is of urgent and pressing
matters. These words should spread as quickly as possible and all
those dwelling in this village should be made aware.

The Black Tower, the group of male channelers that have gathered under
Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, have given orders that any and all
Aes Sedai, Gaidin, or children from the Salidar camp will be taken and
held at their facilities facing imprisonment. Any Aes Sedai that chooses
to enter Caemlyn must identify themselves with their shawl and ring, or
the armband previously requested by the Dragon himself. Women are not
to channel in the city and if found without the appropriate I.D., then
they will suffer the consequences.

It is said that the decision by the Hall of Sitters under Egwene al'Vere
caused the action and that the members of the Black Tower were not
at fault for breaking the treaty. Not much more is known at this time,
but the warning is for all that associate with this Tower.

You have been told and the message has been delivered.

      <text>Earlier today the prisoner Rikard walked into the hut containing the
other prisoner Zohar. Between them they managed to still one aes sedai
and escape through a gateway. Their location is currently unknown,
and a quick search has revealed that both Raina and Alika (the two
women who could lead you to the prisoners) are also missing. The prisoner
Rikard left the sole of his right foot behind when his gateway closed too

      <text>The Hall has met again, this time, to everyone's horror.

Raina Sedai was brought forward and asked to explain the bonding
of the prisoner Rikard and ordered to see him returned for justice
before the Hall for the stilling of an Aes Sedai of the blue ajah,
escaping after being ordered to attend the hall, and the grounds
of gating in unwarranted. Raina was relieved of her position of
Mistress of Novices and will seek out her bondmate with the
accompaniment of different Aes Sedai, mostly members of the
brown ajah to study the ramifications of the bond.

After this issue had been discussed, eight men entered the hall
wearing the black coats of the Asha'man and demanded to be given
the prisoners. When asked to explain themselves, chaos erupted
as they began to manipulate Saidin against the Hall of the Tower.
Twenty-five members of the village lost their lives as the intial
attack began, fifty more left wounded and later healed. In the
end, the Asha were taken down and killed in self defense by both
the Aes Sedai and the quick response of the warders and army.

Proclamations will later be heard by the Amyrlin as she looks
over the damage and time is taken to mourn for the deceased.
Once the healing begins and the smoke has cleared, expect to
hear from the woman we follow. She was left unharmed but the
Keeper of the Chronicles, Celline Sedai, had to be healed after
being thrown back.

The efforts of everyone involved is appreciated as we take a
few days to recover and respond. Please keep the fallen in your
thoughts and may the creator guide them as they leave us. They
died with honor and those that still serve should be commended.

      <text>Yesterday a meeting of the Hall was interupted by 8 Asha'Men. They came
with threats and demands, and when asked to explain why, they attacked
completely unprovoked which resultet in many dead, and even more wounded.
This has lead me to take the only action reasonable at this point.
  From this day forward, and until further notice, all members of the
Black Tower, short of wearing a white flag, is to be considred an enemy
of the Little Tower, and all precaution neccesary must be taken.

Join me in the mourning of all who lost their lives to this treacherous
attack by those that we thought would be our allies.

      <text>Early this morning, just after sunrise.  Several of the scouts and gaidin
working with them came upon a scene of carnage.  Out in the wilds not far
from our village they found the bodies of two rather large black bears,
and a blood trail leading to a third.  It was near that third huge beast
of a bear that they found Alika Chienar Derran, gaidin to Terra Bennington
Galadren of the Brown, and formerly gaidin several other sisters, may the
creator shelter them all in his hand.  The blademistress was near death
when they found her, able only to motion to the bears and utter a few
unintelligible words before she was spun out of the pattern.  Her death
brings added sorrow in this time of mourning, leaving her yougn daughter
Kalia an orphan.  The body of the gaidin was brought back to her small
cabin, where I am assisting the child in preparing the funeral pyre for
her beloved mother.

Since it is unceratin if it was chance and simple misfortune which laid the attempt at my feet, this is a brief warning to others who may venture there. It was a well laid plan and I would suggest partys be wary, specially as I was not easly idenifiable as a Aes Sedai when the attempt was made.

It is greatly disturbing to bring this news to you, but a group of
novices have failed to report for their duties. Upon searching their
rooms, it was discovered that they had not returned the night before.
I ask that all novices and accepted be questioned by an Aes Sedai and
that anyone that has information on these girls to report directly 
to me. I would like men to be dispatched to the surrounding woods
to search for them or remains. It is a dangerous time we live in and
I will see them returned, as well as those that are responsible. I
look forward to -everyone's- help in this.

      <text>After much debate by the Hall of the Tower, it has been declared that
Raina Sedai of the Green Ajah is to pay penance for the crimes commited
by her warder, Rikard.

She is to be sent away from Salidar to live at a small farm in solitude
and contemplate on the consequences of what has happened.  Her warder,
Talbain, will have the choice to have his bond passed to another
Sister before Raina Sedai's departure.  The choice is his and his
alone.  He may choose to join Raina in her punishment, or her may
choose to be passed to another.

Though we are not in Tar Valon, we cannot afford to become lax
in our discipline.  Raina's solitude will remain in place for 100
years, and she may never bond another warder for as long as she
lives.

So it is decreed, so it is to be done.

Novice - &quot;I can't believe I saw that this morning. It was startling. She
was so calm as she approached, as if nothing was going on.&quot;

Accepted - &quot;They are Aes Sedai as you hope to be one day. You know that
you can't afford to show your emotions on your face.&quot;

Novice - &quot;But she was giving him up. Passing him off. Can you imagine what
that had to be like? It makes me study harder so I can help him.&quot;

Accepted - &quot;He is in the best hands, now. Aes Sedai know how to handle
things so that people don't take their lives into their own hands when 
such things happen.&quot;

Novice - &quot;I wish I was Aes Sedai. I'd bond him and let him know that he
wouldn't have to worry about anything. It's so sad..&quot;

Accepted - &quot;Shush now. The rest are approaching for their lessons.&quot;

Novice - &quot;But it's wrong! How can you expect me to accept what has been
done? He had no choice and they all should have..&quot;

Accepted - &quot;Silence. I'll have no more or you'll be in the kitchens from
sun up to sun down to keep you from seeing things that keep your mind 
away from your lessons. I'll go to the Mistress of Novices if I must!&quot;

Novice - &quot;Yes, accepted.&quot;  She began to stare off dreamily as the other
girls approached, all asking what had happened. The accepted immediately
started her lesson and it was said to be a touch class.

OOC - See me if you're interested.

      <text>Madison Sunore, Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah was found
with her throat slit just outside of Salidar proper.  
There was no evidence found, as of yet, as to who
her murderer might have been, but it's surely a sad
day when fully trained Aes Sedai can be in such peril
so close to the city.

awoken.  He had been patrolling the outskirts of the village during those
wee hours, and I rushed to the spot where I knew he had been.  There.

      <text>There seems to be a buzz about some sudden appearances at the
roped off clearing. It seems that Jenevieve Sedai arrived quite
suddenly and with three men. It has been awhile since the small
Aes Sedai has spent any time in Salidar and hasn't been seen
for longer than a few minutes. Her companions consisted of one
man that used to be a resident and two men that had never been
reported in Salidar before. After entering, two left the clearing
without her and looked as if they were off to see to their own
business. The Aes Sedai stayed with what appeared to be a young
lord dressed stylish with a hat on. It isn't clear who any but
two of the entire party were, but have been spotted in different
locations since.

It continues to circulate that they won't be staying long. Which
this may or may not be rumor. One never knows when a novice speaks
the truth.

      <text>It seems that Kaythiel Sedai was seen arriving from an unknown location in
the roped-off clearing reserved for gating to and from Salidar with a girl
who was later identified as Caliva, her warder nowhere in sight.  The girl
was brought to study with the Aes Sedai, perhaps to eventually be raised
to the shawl herself.  Kaythiel Sedai was later seen leading the young
woman to an inn, where rumor has it that Caliva is staying until she dons
the white garb worn by novices.  Soon after, the young Aes Sedai was seen
departing from the inn and returning to the clearing with Kasim Gaidin
behind her, where the two departed for a location unknown by the source of
this rumor.  The girl was left behind, which leads this source to believe
that Caliva is indeed to become a novice.    

[OOC note: Caliva is seeking and is in need of one more sponsor. If you RP
with her around the village and wish to sponsor her, please mudmail Alani as 
notification of the sponsorship so Caliva can begin training. Thank you.]

about the room carelessly, and Fayth Sedai herself was not present. 
In an effort to find Fayth, the accepted searched both the 
yards and the park, where she was known to be found often, 
without any results. At this time, the accepted attempted to find Fayth's
warder, Gaidin Claude, but again proved to be unsuccessful. 
Further investigation revealed that in fact, neither Fayth nor Claude 
have been seen in over a week. Fayth Sedai's puppy, Summer, 
was found alone near the river and handed over to novice Charisse 
until Fayth's whereabouts are discovered. Any information leading to 
the location of Fayth Sedai and Gaidin Claude should be reported 
immediately.

      <text>The Mistress was recently seen by an aide, in her office, taking down
her pictures and packing up her desk. The word is that the reclusive
Yellow wishes more time to study, and so will be surrendering the
position as Mistress, but there is no rumor yet as to who will be
replacing her. What is certain is that this is voluntary, and that
whomever follows after will be provided with extensive information
on the girls at present.
 
OOCly, Alani will be handling the MoN duties, as I have my own guild
to tend ;) There is a note on the Sedai board, for those who are curious.

      <text>  Early the other night an exhausted Gaidin rode into Salidar, his
mount nearly dead from being ridden too hard and long.  He did not
respond to the challenge by the watchers and was taken into custody
very briefly before being released upon being recognized as a 
Gaidin to Porshia Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  He did not speak to
anyone at all until finding another of the Blue Ajah, to who he has
supposedly given an account of whatever event brought him back to
Salidar without his bonded.  After that time, he retreated to his
quarters in the barracks and has only been seen out of his quarters
briefly during which times he got some food, ate without speaking to
anyone, and then returned to his quarters.

      <text>Early this morning Alika Chienar's eight year old daughter, Kalia
was seen leaving the village on horseback, accompanied by
a man fitting the description of her older brother Calic, known
to have been a youngling at one point in the armies of Tar Valon.
It was said by the guards that the pair headed north, and the man
stated that they would not be returning to Salidar.

      <text>Elayne Trakand, Daughter-heir of Andor and Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah and
a small group of companions have left the village travelling south.  
Their destination and reason for leaving is unknown.  Her departure has
caused speculation as to what she is up to, but all that flies around are
rumors.

      <text>Strange happenings have begun around the village.  The Amyrlin Seat has
declared that all Aes Sedai are to return to Salidar immediately.  Rumor
has it that supplies are being gathered.  Only time will reveal what is
truth and what is simple gossip.

      <text>Rumors are flying out of Ebou Dar, all centered around large amounts of
Saidar being used from a point outside of the city.  It has been
discovered that Elayne Trakand and Nynaeve al'Meara were near, if not at,
the site of the disturbance at the time.  Light has been shed on the cause
of all of this, the use of an artifact known as the Bowl of the Winds
being that cause.  It is said that the Bowl is able to change the weather,
a blessing in the current state of neverending heat.  Only time will tell
if such a thing can be accomplished.

      <text>Although not of much note, the child Mesar was found lying in the park
beneath one of the trees, his neck snapped.  It appears as though he was
climbing about as usual, and lost his footing and fell from the tree.  
By the time he was found, it was already too late.  His tiny hand was
clutched around the hilt of his wooden sword even as he fell, and still 
held it to his death.

      <text>A messenger reports back to Salidar with this news...

The charred bodies of Aes Sedai Etaine al'Caar Teyvara and her Gaidin Jerek 
Teyvara were found alongside of the body of the Dedicated Doran al'Kira.  
It is said that the taint overtook Doran, and Etaine and Jerek were just in 
the wrong place at the wrong time.  Condolences have been sent to Deven 
Ride to their families.

had arrived for her lesson.  The body had no visible wounds and there
seemed no sign of struggle, as if the Sedai had died peacefully in her
sleep.
