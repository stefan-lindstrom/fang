      <text>Tzeentch just told me that if you set an object's !tool off, tool it,
then set it's !tool back on, it will revert back to it's old short
desc and anyone wearing the object anywhere on the mud will suddenly
get all their stats altered by the object permanently boosted. He
had this happen to him with an angreal object, where a player online
with the object suddenly got a permanent 50% increase in mana, and then
the normal added 50% mana from the object's affections as well.

So, avoid setting !tool off, tooling, then setting it on again!

      <text>If you type 'policy houses' you will see that players can now build their
own houses. This is a new addition to the responsibilities of the
builders, but a pretty simple one.  All you need to do is collect the
right amount of money then build the rooms/objs somewhere in the zones
related to zone 200. Object and mob vnums should match the room vnums
that the player owns. For instance, if I bought room 20030 and 20031,
the two mobs and objects I can buy are vnums 20030 and 20031.
Objects can be anything at all, from keys for doors to furniture, even
something that can be picked up - they just must have no stats on them.
They should also be unique to that room; set the amount allowed in the
world to 1. The same goes for mobs.

So far as room setting goes, you can set whatever flags the player
asks for and make any doors, titles, extra descs, etc the player
wants. I trust you guys; you all can handle telling players what doesn't
seem acceptable and what does.

Finally, in attaching the house to a place in the world, I'm going
to set up a few actual new streets in the main cities listed in the
policy so we have 'player neighborhoods'. This should keep everything
neater and more easy to manage. I apologize that I don't have the
vnums yet, but I will post again within 3 days with the rest of the
details. You shouldn't be pressured by players to get their houses in
before then.

If you have any questions, suggestions, criticisms, please post!

      <text>I've gotten a chance to add a few neighborhoods and find roads that
are clear enough to add entrances to people's homes. Let me know
what you think. These should work pretty well to keep the cities
from getting too cluttered.

Caemlyn:
  houses - Theren Boulevard, rooms 30482-30489
  shops/inns - plazas after Theren, rooms 30490 and 30491

Illian:
  houses - Flower Lane, rooms 26003-26009
  shops - anywhere along the docks, starting at room 26169

Aringill:
  both - anywhere along the wall roads

West of Caemlyn:
  both - anywhere along the roads between Four Kings (2501-2528)
     and Whitebridge (1586-1599)

East of Cairhien:
  both - anywhere along the road to the Waste (7500-7520)

I have nothing yet for the Two Rivers or any other area. What is
currently set up is expandable, of course, if we need more room for
more houses. Feel free to use any unused exit to fill up space.

      <text>Since we don't have mounts, and it's a one exit room, at the request
of a player I set it !MOB so mobs don't wander in and out and spam RP.
