      <text>No, this is not something to be afraid of. There comes a time when changes 
are necessary to make, and by the look of things, I say that the time has 
come. With that said, I would like to say that it is a pleasure to be here 
to make these changes. Yes, this means that you have a new GL. If there is 
anything that you may require, be it that something is wrong and you need 
it fixed or just someone to talk to about thoughts, concerns, or every day 
life, I'm the person to see.

You may notice that the board has been cleaned. I made a note of things that 
were important but not so much that they needed to remain and clutter our 
space. You may also notice changes in geq, ghelp files, and various other 
things in the next few weeks. This is all a part of the process to revive 
the guild and return it to the status that it deserves. Please be patient 
while I settle in and everything. I promise that it won't take too long.

In short, if you have anything at all you want to see, let me know. Thoughts 
about anything, let me know. Concerns or ideas? I'm here to listen. Take me 
up on the offer.

      <text>Another good thing, rewards are. What this means to you is that those who 
take the time to be active and roleplay will get something for their effort. 
That something is questpoints. Log your roleplay, email or mudmail it to me, 
and you will get a base award of five questpoints per log with the possibility 
of more for excellent emotes and skill. Please don't allow this offer to go 
to waste.

      <text>The seeking process has been changed a bit. The base rank of 'Aiel' has been 
removed, and so it needed a bit of tweaking. With activity levels as they 
currently are, each new seeker will be given two options after background 
authorization. They may either roleplay with one of you guys to gain a sponsor 
or they can roleplay around Caemlyn or what have you as the position that they 
are seeking to become within the guild. If they choose to take option two, 
a log must be submitted to the Aiel GL type, and a decision will be made at 
that point. It will usually be to proceed with guilding as usual, but another 
log may be requested before that takes place.

Thoughts, concerns, comments, or even flames? Mail me.
&amp;r-&amp;WA&amp;wlani&amp;n

P.S. - Some of your ranks may be messed up because of this change. If that is 
the case with you, drop me a line and we'll get it fixed as soon as possible.

      <text>I see you, Aiel. .. I think.

Here's what's up and why the sudden titles with this guild in them.

As seen on OOC, there are divisons now for the immortals. This guild does
happen to fall into two of them, therefore you have two Group Leaders that
are responsible for the guild. You have Alani, our lovely leader in charge
of the Female Channeling and then you have fiesty Lyeshal that is the head
of Foriegn Lands. They will both be here to assist you in what you need
and to help out the problems the guild has experienced over such a period
of inactivity.

If any of you are active and are interested in the Guild Leader position,
do get in touch with me. I'm unsure which of you do play but we're always
working on getting new guildies, right? Right! So.. yeah, mail me. :p

      <text>As per the heading of this message, you guys have new guild eq. All of you 
need to see either myself or Lyeshal for your new set. Ghelp files should be 
in place soon with details as to the stats on each piece.

That is all.

      <text>yeah, no pretty colors.  I'm not in a pretty colors kind of mood right now.
As I'm sure you're already aware if you've been keeping up with the guild
board, I'm one of the new group leaders.  Yep.  Fun.  Give me a few to settle
into the Aiel mindset, or at least find a corner of my mind to stuff the 
Aiel mindset into as my brain is currently overtaxed with the Seanchan 
mindset. I need a bigger brain.

As far as the guild eq is concerned, well, some things need to be discussed
with Amarinda and Alani about it first, so don't come bombarding me with
requests for the new stuff because I won't give it to you until these issues
have been settled.

Expect to see a posting about some form of guild meeting within the coming
days. In the meantime, for my own personal records, I'd really appreciate it
if you would each send me a mail saying that you're alive and what you're 
currently ICly doing.

Thanks.

      <text>The boards have been cleaned. There wasn't much to remove, but it was done 
anyway. If there's anything you'd like to see here or in a ghelp file, feel 
free to mail either myself or Lyeshal.

On another note, activity is to be rewarded. Log in, roleplay, have fun, get 
questpoints for mailing in logs. Aiel are supposed to be fun in their own way. 
Make use of the interesting characters you've spent time creating. :)

My door is always open. Feel free to send a mail or tell if you need something 
or just want to talk.

      <text>There's a few people who are currently seeking the guild.  Granted, they
seem to not log in much, but the reason is apparently because they cannot
find people to RP with for sponsorship.  This is your guild, folks.  We
just do what we're told and try to keep some order to the place.  If
there's a seeker who belongs in the guild, you need to get out there, RP
with them, and figure out if they're worthy of being Aiel or not.  They
will not be guilded without the sponsors.  You all get to choose who's in
and who's out.  The command to view these seekers is '&amp;Yseeking 9&amp;n'.  Make
use of it.  This week I'll be going through the glist and giving everyone
the permission to sponsor others, so there will be no excuse on your part.
I expect to see a log alongside of a sponsorship.  You are to roleplay
with them to form your opinion of them.  Idle chatter OOC means nothing.
Well, not nothing, but talk is cheap.  Actions speak much louder than
words.  Logs will be awarded, as will sponsorship.  You take the time to
help further the guild and I will take the time to be sure you are awarded
properly.

      <text>I mailed the three authorized seekers a while back, offering
sponsor roleplay.  Aidem was the only one to respond though.
Wondering about the other, unauth'd types, whether they've
written backgrounds and such.  But me no know.

      <text>Yeah, they've not been on much, unfortunately.  The three unauth'd have not
submitted suitable backgrounds yet. The first two ... I've never met them.
Turic has recently stated that he's given up, so I don't think we'll be
hearing from him.

      <text>Hey folks,
As of this past Monday, I resigned from the position of Foreign Lands Imm.
I'll be staying here as the Mortal GL of Seanchan, but will no longer be
in any form of charge over Aiel.  You'll be receiving a new Foreign Lands
Imm within the next couple of days.  Until then, please direct all needs
to Alani.

      <text>Hullo, dearies. After speaking with Natalia and Roc'sai, it has been decided 
that there will be no syllabus for Wise Ones. This being the case, there was 
some questions about how to deal with promotions, a detail which was also 
handled. In order to be promoted from the rank of Wise One Apprentice, a 
total of 15 RP logs must be submitted. During those 15 sessions, we wish to 
see a general sense of improvement and Wise One type behavior.

If there are any questions about this or anything else, all three of 
us are more than willing to provide answers for you.

      <text>   Alright.  I'm going to try to make this as quick as possible, so I
don't tak e too much of your time.  Yes, I applied for this job willingly.
I believe I can help raise activity in this guild, but to do so I need
help.  I need cooperation from those of you who are still active.  I'll
try to convince Natalia to run more quests for us, but to do so I'm sure
she wants at least a little activity.  Also , just for those who weren't
aware, being that Aiel travel you hardly have any r estrictions as to
where you RP, or who you RP with.  (Although I do ask you keep it
realistic, and ask whoever it is's permission before you interrupt their
RP.  ) As soon as possible, I need those of you that are active to mail
me, and tell me so.  The quicker this happens, the quicker I can start
poking natalia to start quests.  Also, if you have any ideas whatsoever,
that can help increase activity , or just the fun factor in the Aiel,
please send it to myself or Natalia.  (Do n ote though, I'm sure she's way
busier then I am, so it'd be better to send to me, where I can then read
them all and make a quick summary for her , so as to reduce the time it
takes her.  ) Aside from that,all I ask is that you RP, and please send a
log to Natalia or myself.  (You will be rewarded depending upon
consistency of posting as well as quality.  Not to say that just because
you live and breathe RP means you will get more then someone else.  Just
enough to show you're making an effort.  )

      <text>This is something that I thought was important to bring up because of
an incident earlier.  I wanna lay down the rules that have been discussed
between Hiran and myself.  We're not going to forbid the use of profanity
on the channel but we'd like to keep it to a minimum, so no overuse of
cuss words.  Also, we would like to forbid the use of racials slurs in a
derogatory way.  Playful banter is fine but the first time someone
mentions something about being offended, then it is to end right there.  
Refusing to stop using slurs will result in your gchan privelages being
taken away.  Lastly, sexual innuendo..  Honestly, I'm not offended by much
in that category but there might be others who feel different from me.  
As long as it doesn't go into explicit detail and it's just some joking
around, then I do not see a problem with it.  We are here to have fun,
that includes me.  It won't be much fun if I'm laying down a bunch of
rules for you guys and having to enforce them.  If there is something on a
gchan that bothers you but is not against this new policy then you have
the option of turning off the channel.

Thank you, 

Natalia
