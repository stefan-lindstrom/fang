Renalla and Kiala are visiting, so will be logging from the same computer.
Usually I'd pester them about it and stuff, to check out the story, but it
came straight from Illy so I think we can trust them to be telling the
truth.

Lor and Kiara are both living in the same building at school. They show
up as multiplayers on the list while on together at the same time. Lor
said that Kiara's player lives two floors up from her.

He's been warned for multiplaying. Had both alts in the oval and
went linkless with Lokken to sign on Disa. Said it wouldn't happen
again. This public service announcement brought to you by the letter F.

      <text>Sebastian/Renner and Glynis/Kalia have two computers linked on
a network so they can be online together at different times if
they are at Kalia's. Seems fine with me.

multi'd for a few minutes today, and he received a warning. This is
merely documentation, so if he does it again, action can be taken.

Carry on.

      <text>Just to confirm, they are at work and yeah, it's Pat and
Donna.  They also have a network at home as well too
so they'll likely be seen with two different IPs.  One work
and one home IP.  Although I don't think they log in from
home all that much really.

      <text>This player multi-logged with the idea of passing EQ between
alts.  I corrected this behavior by informing him that such
things were illegal.  So if he's caught doing it again, just know
he's been warned once already.

      <text>Since we don't always know what alts a person has, and people will likely 
get tired of us asking every alt of theirs, would it not be better, alongside
of putting the names discovered when posting an OK IP on this board, to put
the actual IP address in?

      <text>I'd asked Allesande and Therys about their possible multi log as I hadn't
seen these alts names on the list, nor their address.  Turns out they're
Kalia and Sebastian, previously noted.  Here's their IP for the future:
&amp;R35.12.16.238&amp;n

      <text>In theory, it'd be great to list by IP addy but unfortunatly, they
change around a great deal. Some will always have the same addy, but
most don't. So it would come close to useless information.

      <text>Well, then perhaps, as we discover new alts of theirs, we can update the
posts.  Some way of attempting to keep track of who all is approved.  I
feel a little awkward approaching someone who very likely has already been
approved simply because I don't know their alts.  Those of you who've been
around on here for a while, Tze, Ama, Hart, etc, can probably recognize
alts on site, but the newer imms like me would have no clue.

      <text>I wouldn't mind seeing something like siteok for alts of people like that.
They could let us know when they have a new alt and we could toggle it on
or off depending. I know how you feel.. it's been a problem for awhile.

I proposed a change to the code, as well. Instead of having it in syslog
like we do now, having it show to imms over level 200 as a pretitle much
like disguise does. If you haven't seen disguise, look for it. It wouldn't
be viewable to morts, only imms.

      <text>I've seen disguise, yah.  Hmm yeah that sounds like it'd be a good idea,
too.  Easy, clearly visible way to view it.
I just felt so awkward approaching the two of them earlier, only to find
out they'd already been approached a couple times.  On the plus side, it
turned out one of Therys' alts is in Seanchan and I finally got to give
him his new EQ and get him caught up in the guild ;)
I'll stop spamming this board now :)  Feel free to remove my ramblings.

      <text>Jakenth has been given a warning about multilogging.  He claims Draconth is
a friend of his, but admitted that his friend was not controlling the character
at the moment, and that he was just trying to help him out since he wasn't
on at the moment.
So he's been warned.  He can't say he didn't know.
