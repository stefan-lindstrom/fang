      <text>The following judicial system is employed by the M'Hael at this time:

First Infraction: Restriction.
Infraction while Restricted: Execution.
Four Infractions Overall: Execution.

Infraction - Any act that is considered treasonous, proves to be a clear and 
present danger by the M'Hael, or puts the lives of other Asha'man at jeopardy.

Restriction - Anyone who has been branded Restricted will receive the
Restricted subrank, and may not leave the Black Tower. It is adviced that
the character prove himself to the M'Hael in order to have the punishment
lifted.

This is the standard. Exceptions can be made, and they are completely up 
to the M'Hael's discretion.

      <text>There is zero tolerance towards deserters and would-be traitors to the 
Black Tower.  Due to the danger apparent in allowing a man trained in 
the One Power to roam the world, search parties will be called 
immediately to find and capture the victim to bring him to justice.  The 
High Asha'man is in charge of organizing and dispatching these parties. 
The parties will not relent until the victim is either found or confirmed 
dead.  In both cases, the victim's head is purged from its body, and 
secured to a branch on the Traitor's Tree.

Asha'man rank or higher may NPC one Dedicated and two Soldiers at his
discretion. This should be done sparingly.

Dedicated rank may NPC up to two Soldiers while on patrol or active
recruitment.

Soldiers may not NPC without express permission from a GL, CRE or SM.

The travelling weave is a -very- dangerous weave if used in a public place.
The edges are incredibly sharp and cut through whatever happens to be where
the gate opens. If a person happens to be standing at the spot where a
gate opens, that person dies. Use common sense when gating. In a society
without lawyers, there is probably not much difference in the penalty for
manslaughter than there is the penalty for murder. Please refrain from
gating into public or highly travelled places. There are two rooms in
Caemlyn set aside for this, one in the basement of the Golden Bowl, the
other in the Andoran palace. These are not code rooms, if a need arises
I can see about having such rooms built in the code. Regardless, do not
ICLY gate into a public area and do not gate out of one except in dire
need.

Thank you,

Tzeentch

      <text>Under no circumstances may a guildmember of the Black Tower bond another
player with OOC intentions and purposes.

You must know how to bond ICly before you can obtain the Ashabond
weave.

Contrary to prior belief, the Asha'man-Wife bond is not weaker than
that of Sedai-Warder, however with less experince with bonding,
the Asha'man aren't able to use the bond to the same advantages.
They are able to sense direction, emotion, and pain through the
bond.

      <text>Those of Soldier[Recruit] ranking are not yet allowed off the farm.  They 
are quite green, and do not have the knowledge nor the experience required 
to function in the world outside as representatives of the Black Tower.

At the ranking of Soldier[Junior], a guildie is permitted outside the farm 
for roleplay so long as he is accompanied by another guildie of 
Soldier[Senior] rank or higher.

Upon attaining the Soldier[Senior] rank, a guildie is permitted to leave 
the farm for his own patrols and activities between training and chores.  
Relaxing in taverns between patrols is permitted.

Although it is highly unlikely, those of Soldier[Recruit] and 
Soldier[Junior] rank may be ordered off the farm by an Asha'man or higher 
rank.  In this case, the Asha'man in question assumes full responsibility 
for the Soldier's actions.

      <text>To learn the Gate weave, you have to meet three criteria.

1) Have the required flows (all at least 35)
2) Be at least Soldier[Senior] (to be considered ICly strong enough
   to perform the weave.
3) Have Six (6) trains to be Instructed the weave.

If all three conditions are met, you can be taught the weave by a
guildie who knows it (Teaching the weave entails both how to emote
it ICly.)  Once this has occured, the guildie who taught the weave
should contact the GL to have the Travelling skill set on the
learner so the weave maybe be taught with Instruct.

      <header>&amp;WIC Channeling Strength Policy &amp;r(Old)&amp;n</header>

      <text>** This is a repost of the Policy covering IC Channeling Strength. **
 
 
Channeling Strength Policy
 
Several situations have arisen recently in which the ability to determine
relative IC strength in the One Power was necessary for resolution of the
conflict. GLs change often enough, and IMMs have varying enough opinions,
that simply having an IMM make a judgement call on who is ICly stronger is
not feasible. A person's relative IC strength would change each time a
different IMM is asked. We are working on a more equitable long-term
solution. In the meantime, I am implementing this policy instead. As it is
already policy that one may only claim IC training in the One Power via a
GL of a channeling guild, I will handle the situation by making guild
policies which affect -all- guilds.
 
Maximum IC strength:
 
A person's MAXIMUM IC strength in the One Power is BASED off the total of
his or her code flows. The code values of the INDIVIDUAL flows should not 
be considered IC. The purpose of this policy is purely to determine 
overall strength. Quirks of our code channeling system cause most people
to be fairly equal in the five powers. This is highly inconsistant with the
way the One Power worked in the books. Since the ability to overpower and
shield someone are the main focus of this policy, the individual flows
matter little, anyway. This total will be modified by IC training and 
gender.
 
Female IC strength:
 
A fully trained woman will have IC strength equal to the total of her code
flows. Yes, this means if you wish to RP as a strong channeler and have
other people accept this RP, you need to level up your flows. The strengths
of those less than fully trained will vary slightly from guild to guild. In
the Rebel Tower and White Tower, fully trained will be considered Aes Sedai
rank and higher. At Accepted, a woman's strength will be equal to 2/3 of 
her code strength. For a Novice, it will be 1/3. This is just an example,
the exact details will be posted on the guild boards for each guild and in
ghelp files in those guilds.
 
Male IC strength:
 
A fully trained man will have IC strength equal to the total of his code
flows multipled by 1.3. Yes, this means that the average man is stronger
than the average woman. From examples in the books, this multiplier should
be a good deal higher. In the interests of maintaining some form of game
balance, a lower number was chosen. This number can and will change if
necessary. For men, guild training will determine when they reach this full
strength. &amp;R(Edit: This section was written with the old advancement system 
in mind.  The updated policy is given two messages down)For Asha'man, it 
will be at the [Skilled] subrank. Dreadlords
will be considered full strength at Dreadlord Lieutenant. Dreadlord 
Initiate and [Adept] subrank will be considered 2/3 strength. Dreadlord
Recruit and [Novice] subrank will be considered 1/3 strength. These numbers
are also modified by the 1.3 multiplier. For Asha'man, the [Tested] subrank
will be considered of negligible strength. &amp;n
 
For people of either gender who have had guild training and then left the
guild, such as runaways or traitors, they shall be considered full strength
if they have grasp and release to 100%.
 
Shielding:
 
Since the main purpose of establishing IC strength is to determine whether
or not one person can easily shield another, I feel it is necessay to
address shielding specifically. Because of the way the code is written,
many people think that strength in Spirit is all that determines whether
or not someone can be shielded. All examples in the books point to it being
a matter of total strength. The weave itself is composed purely of Spirit,
but the muscle behind it is total strength. If caught off guard, most any
channeler can be shielded. Assume if someone is sleeping, or unaware and
not holding the Power, he or she can be easily shielded. The situations
where strength is important are when that shielded person tries to break

      <text>free or when someone is already holding the Power. The following numbers
are crude and arbitrary and subject to change.

If someone is already grasping, a ten percent advantage is needed to
handily shield him or her.  For example, if a woman with 200 strength is
grasping, a man or woman with at least 220 strength is needed to easily
shield her.  To further clarify, &quot;easily shield&quot; means that if the
shielder puts full effort into it, the shieldee cannot successfully
resist.  People who are close in strength can still shield each other, but
it requires quite an effort and a struggle and is not easily resolved via
code.  If someone is shielded by a person who is weaker, the shielded
person needs at least a ten percent strength advantage to break free.  
These rules cannot cover every eventuality.  Obviously, it would be hard
to maintain a shield on someone while engaged in a One Power battle with
someone else.  This policy is not meant to handle such things.  It is
meant purely to give a way of judging IC strength.    

It should be noted that the 1.3 multiplier for men already takes into
account the fact that the average female channeler has decades more 
experience in using the One Power. From numerous examples in the books,
shielding, holding a shield and breaking a shield are matters mostly of
brute strength. Being an ancient channeler may make you skilled and
crafty. It does not make you able to lift more weight with Air or hold
a stronger channeler with a shield.
Linking:
 
Men have, on average, greater strength in the One Power. Women can offset
this advantage by linking. Linking is not terribly efficient, however. In
order to determine the strength of a link, take the total strength of the
leader of the circle and add thirty percent of the strength of each
additional person in the link. For example, if two women each have 200
strength, if linked, the total strength of the link would be 260 (200 + 
1.3 * 200). In order to shield a member of a circle, one must have a ten
percent strength advantage against the strength of the circle.
 
NPCs:
 
Inside guild areas, it is necessary to have fully ranked members of the
guild have access to NPCs. For example, in a place such as Salidar where
over four hundred Aes Sedai are crammed into a tiny village, it is highly
unlikely that a huge scene in the village square would not draw attention.
It is inevitable, then, that the question of NPC strength will come into
play. A fully trained NPC female channeler will have a strength of 150. An
NPC is an average represtentative of its group. Since the books say that
only ten percent of the women in Salidar were strong enough to form a 
useful gate, giving the average NPC a strength slightly less than gate
strength seems reasonable. Following the multipliers from above, the
average male chan NPC would have a 195 strength. Novices, Accepted and such
would be modified down, accordingly. 

Since channelers are such powerful characters, specific permission must be 
obtained from the GL and HGL for EACH use of channeling NPCs outside of the 
guild area. Inside the guild area, the rules for NPC use will be posted on 
the guild boards and in the ghelp files of the pertinent guilds.
 
New strength ranges:
 
Female code strength maximums can range from 70 (for a non-channeling class
that sparks) at the low end to 280 (max strength wilder class) at the high
end. For a male these numbers would be 91 and 364. This gives us averages
of 175 for women and 228 for men.

      <text>The above two posts outline the mud-wide policy for IC channeling strength.
This post deals only with the ranks at which 1/3, 2/3, and full power are
reached.

Soldier[Recruit]  - Negligible strength
Soldier[Junior]   - 1/3 strength
Soldier[Senior]   - 2/3 strength
Dedicated[Junior] - Full strength
Dedicated[Senior] - Full strength
Asha'man          - Full strength
