      <text>It's kinda self explanatory, I think...  But just to check, the posts here
should be about IC matters within the tower.  They don't have to -be- ic,
like letters, notes, etc, but if something happens in the tower that would
get a lot of attention, you can drop a post here.

      <text>I've brought a girl by the name of Samea Lara's to the Tower.  She was
unaware of her ability to channel, and is currently staying in the guest

      <text>**A note, which will likely make its way to the MoN**

A couple of days ago I noticed the new arrival of Samea and the
trainee Darien in the sparring yard. Trainee Darien and Samea were
actually fighting, with lathes, until Darien defeated the girl and fell on 
top of her. They were lying there for several moments, not making 
any move to rise until finally Samea slipped out from underneath him.

I find this most highly discouraging and disturbing!

      <text>A young man looking something like this, *desc Oenone..yes, I know
that's a cheesy way of doing it, but the RP is long since out ot my
scrollback ;)* has come to the White Tower to seek training as a
Warder. While I did not get the man's name, or even have much
opportunity to speak with him at the time, I did tell him to seek
out the Master at Arms. If anyone see's the young man wandering about,
please either escort him to the Master at Arms or at least set him
up within a guest room until someone can. It would not be proper
for the White Tower to seem incordial to visitors, especially those
who have considered devoting their services to it's cause.

      <text>*OOC Note:*
Hello all, I'm the new Master at Arms for the White Tower, there
alot of wonderful things in the works, including a new 
syllabus which is being carefully put into place, and 
a very hard effort to bring the glory back to the White Tower
that it once had. 

As we progress and grow together, I surely hope that we can 
get some activity in the guild and get a good base together. Alot
of people are bitter over others here, and that's never a 
good thing. Someday, the Rebels and the White Tower will clash, 
and the Tower will once again be reunited. In order to prepare 
for this, we must as a guild, come together, and get 
the Tower ready for the future.  Let us shake the ties that bind, 
and cast forth a fist high into the air torwards defeat, shaking it
as we charge forth to rebuild anew.

** IC **
-=Written in a superb handwriting, a note is posted here.=-

Let all who walk these halls be informed that Shondai Sudaki, 
formerly of Shienar, now hold the title of Master at Arms, 
respectfully promoted by the Amyrlin Seat with careful
consultation and consideration by my peers. Those who have
reason to seek an audience with me feel freely to enter 
my office, it is open to anyone who could need me.

Signed,
Shondai Sudaki, Master at Arms.

afternoon practice.  Bed made and everything in its place, very little had
been taken.  Lying across the bed was a long-hafted hammer with a
black;steel head, looking to be of the type for smithing.  Reports say
that the young man had only left for a walk in the city, but had never

      <text>Rumors abound through the Tower.  The word Salidar is on the lips of the
Gaidin and their Sedai as it is reported that someone among the ranks has
come from Salidar as a spy, a traitor, and even a defector.  These rumors
all point to the one Trainee who turned up missing.  Trainee Darien was
seen speaking with Toban Dal'Aman.  Turning over his blades, he was
escorted to the Barracks and to his quarters, where he was left, to later
speak with his superiors.

      <text>For the crime of physical assault on an Aes Sedai, the Warder Rathan 
Dramiel is to be flogged, publicly, before the entire population of the 
White Tower.  Novices will be excused from lessons and chores and 
with Accepted, Trainees, Gaidin, and all Aes Sedai currently within 
the Tower, attend the Traitors Court to witness the each of the thirty 
lashes.  
 
Additionally, Rathan will be exiled from Tar Valon for at least one full 
year, and should he attempt to return to the island before this period 
expires, exiled until his death.
 
This punishment is deemed by the Hall of the Tower to be adequate 
retribution the crime.  Further action taken against the Warder by any 
individuals will be met with harsh judgement.

      <text>The Accepted Jaelyn su Chuliandred, an Accepted only days from the
Test for the Shawl, and Sloane Ahearne, an Advanced Trainee who had
almost completed his training, were given day passes into Alindaer,
but seem to have dissapeared.  When no sign of them was found after
4 days, the Mistress of Novices has declared Jaelyn a possible run-
away, and that if any sign of her is discovered, word is to be passed
to her at once.  She has asked the same be done for Sloane as well,
though the word should be sent to the Master of Trainees instead.

      <text>Greetings in the Light to the White Tower, and to all true Sisters therein.
I have been traveling for some time, and have finally found myself to be
settled to my satisfaction in Illian. The Council of Nine and King Mattin
Stepaneos den Balgar have graciously requested my services in 
capacity as the Advisor to Illian, and I have accepted, under the Light. I may
be reached henceforth at the palace of the Council of Nine, where I am now
residing. 

I remain loyal to the White Tower, and to the rightful Amyrlin Seat,

      <text>Anibelle Sedai, Sitter for the Grey Ajah, took her leave of the Tower this
morning with plans for an extended stay in Caemlyn.  While her
disappearance wasn't entirely unexpected - her plans were public enough -
it was sudden in that she left alone, with scant pause taken for goodbyes.
Her resignation from the position of Sitter was also expected, but the
speed of her disappearance certainly leaves space for rumour.

      <text>Word passes along the usualy channels of High Captain Iavoe Kindar's
retirement from active duty as a member of the Tower Guard. His second
in command has moved to fill the position left by the long time officer
for the time being, though only the Hall of the Tower and the Amyrlin
Seat herself know for sure what is to happen with the military force.

Regardless of the state of the army of Tar Valon though, rumors say
that though Iavoe has retired from active duty he will still be a
presence within the White Tower. Apparently the man's life has become
quite attached to the White Tower in the decades he has spent in it's
service. So it seems he will be floating around as an occasional
advisor and purveyor of wisdom and strategy to whomever fills his
shoes within the Tower Guard, and may be found in his old offices
or on the training grounds, if he is within the White Tower's walls.
It is said he spoke to some of his officer's of travelling and perhaps
learning of other military groups and training styles, and has left
a contact in Caemlyn where they may send word to him in the case of
emergencies.

Whatever the real truths of the situation may be, it is clear that
things have changed within the Tower Guard and that one of it's oldest
officers will no longer play the role he once did.

      <text>Chaos and destruction erupted in the Yellow Ajah Halls late last night
as large amounts of Saidar were felt being channeled from the rooms of
Jaiana Sedai and followed by the sudden outward collapse of a good 
portion of the hallway walls. When the rubble was cleared enough to
allow entrance, the Mistress of Novices was discovered barely concious
and severely hurt, along with Aidan, Sergeant of the Tower guard and a
common visitor to the Aes Sedai's rooms. After further clean up, two
corpses were found. One was the body of Lauriana, a Novice and former
Rebel, and was gruesome to behold as her head was in too many pieces
to have been the work of the collapsed walls. The other was that of an
as yet unidentified man, whom many had watched Lauriana guide through
the Tower in the scant minutes before the catastrophe.

Further investigation of the matter has turned up two assassinated
guards at Rose Gate, who were believed to have been killed shortly
before Lauriana and the man were seen inside the Tower.  The exact
cause of their death has yet to be determined, but use of the One
Power is believed to be involved.  Both Jaiana Sedai and the Sergeant
have given the story that the dead man had shown up at Jaiana Sedai's
door, and threatened Jaiana's life, showing himself to be a male
channeler by killing Lauriana before attacking. During the fight, the
man apparently over-exhausted himself and ended his own existance in a
decidedly messy manner, causing a number of the wards in Jaiana Sedai's
rooms to trigger and only make a bad situation worse.  Belinda Sedai
has testified that she saw Lauriana and the man standing out in the
hallway outside of Jaiana Sedai's rooms, trying to speak with whomever
was inside, thus lending support to Jaiana and Aidan's claims.

Repairs to the Yellow Ajah Halls and other damaged areas are underway.
The duties of the Mistress of Novices are being overseen by Melanie
Sedai while Jaiana Sedai recovers.  Jaiana Sedai has taken up temporary
residence in her own offices until her rooms are once more habitable.
The Lieutenant suffered only minor injuries and has since returned to
active duty.  Neither he nor Jaiana Sedai are being brought before
the Hall, as they are thus far believed to be cleared of any wrong-
doing in this incident.

I have received pigeons bearing messages from the family Ezara...
Our beloved Lio, former Sitter of the Hall, has fallen in her homeland
of Shienar. The family relates that she and her warder, Toban, helped
to stem the most recent of attacks on the border, and in doing so,
surrendered their very lives. The messages are short, and do not give
a tremendous amount of detail, but it is made clear that the pair died
serving the Light and with honor. And for a Green, this is the highest
compliment. If there are any that wish to view the messages, I have
them in my quarters... This is a day of mourning for us all. Light
guard us, and protect the memory of Lio Ezara, Green Ajah.

      <text>1. No trainee below the rank of Student will bear steel without the 
   express consent of a fully-ranked Gaidin.

2. Aspirants may only associate with Novices and Accepted while 
   supervised. Students may associate with Novices and Accepted while
   unsupervised, but only in public locations.

3. No Aspirant, Student, or Protege may leave Tar Valon unless 
   accompanied by a fully-ranked Gaidin or without the express consent 
   of an Aes Sedai.

4. No Aspirant or Student may consume alcoholic beverages.

5. No student may fail to show respect to those of higher rank or to 
   Novices, Accepted, and Aes Sedai.

OOC NOTE: These rules are IC rules, and not in any way an enforcement 
of RP.  A student may choose to break the rules ICly at any time, with 
no fear of OOC punishment.  Only IC consequences will result, and that 
only if the student is caught.  Common courtesy will be strictly 
enforced in that regard, as in, private RP CANNOT be intruded upon 
without the consent of all parties involved.  Therefore, anyone RPing a 
rule-breaking who does not wish to be caught OOCly will not be.  The 
only addendum to this is public places, in which anyone can join RP.  
Locations such as the Training Yards and Salidar Square are presumed to 
be inhabited at all hours, thus, supervision in those places is 
assumed.  The NPCing of fully-ranked characters is not allowed.

      <text>Citizens of the White Tower:

Khalis del'Kendar, Captain of the Tower Guard,
and Dean of the War College has left the White
Tower.

He resigned his commission this morning, and was
last seen leaving by the bridges heading west.

His page, Yssa was given his heron marked sword
and instructed to see that it be returned to 
Breman Mankilar, the master smith in Tear who
crafted it.

His departure marks a changing of the guard.
May the light illumine him, and may he shelter
in the palm of the creator's hand.

That is all.
