Some levelling formulas:

Practices:
(int + wis - 32)/4 plus a random addition of 3 to 5

Trains:
Everyone gets 1 train each level unless they have 255 trains, in which
case, they don't get any.
Additionally, there is a 25% chance of getting a second train. This is
not affected by stats.
Soldier and Adventurer have a 30% chance of 2 extra practices.
Thief, Craftsman, Wisdom have a 40% chance of 2 extra practices.
(if they aren't sparked or teachable, that is)

HP/Mana/Move for everyone (class bonus listed in next section):
5 to 14  + (con - 13)/4 (HP)
5 to 14  + (wis - 13)/4 (Mana)
3 to 5 + (dex -13)/4 (move)

Soldier and Adventurer:
+14 to hitpoints if sparked/teachable
if not: +14 + 1/4 of the mana they would have gotten had they been
sparked/teachable.

+3 to mana if sparked/teachable. None if not.

Thief/Craftsman/Wisdom:
+10 to hitpoints if sparked/teachable
if not: +10 + 1/4 of the mana they would have gotten had they been
sparked/teachable.

+5 to mana if sparked/teachable. None if not.

Channeler:
+4 to hitpoints.
+11 to mana.
Wilder:
+4 to hitpoints.
+15 to mana.

not find a cost listed for it in the code. I hope this all is
helpful.

Dice results for Taveren are 4 to 6. Everyone else is 1 to 6.

Practices add 30 plus a random number from 0 to your UNMODIFIED int plus a
 random number from 0 to your UNMODIFIED wis. Then divide by 2. That's right
 folks, stat eq does not affect practicing. It does affect how many pracs you
 get when you gain a level, though. Oh, and if you are ta'veren, it adds a 
random number from -25 to +25.

(30 + random(0, unmodified int) +random(0, unmodified wis))/2
or, anywhere from 15 at the minimum to 45 at the maximum.

So, those who raise their stats all the way to 30 with trains average
30 per practice and those like me who have natural stats at 4 and use
just loads of stat eq average 17 or so per practice. Since everyone
uses practices to get to 70% anyway, that means the difference is not
that great. Max stats causes an average of 61% after 2 pracs. So they
still have to spend a third to get to 70. Takes me 4 pracs to get to
69 on average. Sometimes it takes it to 70. Either way, takes ten 
skills to cost me an extra train and 46 or so trains to raise my stat
to 30.. 92 to raise both int and wise to 30.. So, it would take around
920 skills for it to average out.

Oh, not counting the different skills that affect regen, Soldier and
Adventurer regain hitpoints 30% faster and Wilders and Channelers
regain mana 30% faster. Yes, a sparked wisdom is totally screwed.

      <text>I'll try to make this as short as possible:

I am now the newest Helpers GL.

I'd like to thank Masema for doing a bang-up job and listening where it
was needed and all that jazz. Any mudmails/emails (coming) can be directed to
me about this now, instead of him. As always and my policy always shall be, bug
me if you have concerns. Its why i'm here.

This is very important. AC is figured two different ways.. well,
actually, that is not actually true. The chance to hit is figured two
different ways. One of those ways limits AC, the other does not. If a
PLAYER character is attacking, the most AC than can affect the attack
is -200. So, if someone spells up to better their AC for PK, they are
wasting their time. If a mob is swinging, there is no -technical- limit
to the AC. The practical limit is -1100. If a mob has maximum hitroll
(200) and there is no fog affecting the room, -1100 AC will reduce the
mob's chance of hitting to 0. I haven't bothered to stat all the mobs,
and I'm not going to, to see what the hitrolls on them are. Since
people have reported -600 AC as protecting them from Tower Guards, I'm 
guessing that those mobs have +75 hitroll. At that point or less, -600
would negate their chance to hit. If you happen to know a mob's hr,
something it is against policy for IMMs to hand out to you, you can
figure up how much AC you need to protect yourself from them. Multiply
their hitroll by four, add 75, that's how -negative- AC you need to
render the mob incapable of hitting you. If the room is affected by
fog, you can subract 5 from their hitroll.

The most hitroll you need is around 200. You always have a 1% chance of
missing, anyway. But with 200+ hitroll, you will never have greater
than a 1% chance of missing. Certain skills, like leadership, lower
how much hitroll you need. It's way too much trouble to figure out
how much, though, since these are guild skills and affected by level.
Also, it is not that hard to get hitroll to 200.

      <text>Okay, its been some notion that the HBL setup some sign saying that you'd
have to buy the eq in baerlon to figure out stats. Thats bunk, and verily
stupid. So I went out and bought everything and found out its stats. Here
it is.
Note: For EQ, i've stuck where its worn after the name, and some I didn't
bother putting the whole name, since it was basically only one sold there.
Not to mention that I doubt its hard to spot the only &quot;greaves&quot; in baerlon.
For another thing, the first pieces of EQ are found -on- mobs. This is the
cheapest stuff to buy...but not necessarily the best. However, the dress
kicks ass.

Mob EQ:

cloak: about
5hr/5dr, 35 abs

boots: feet
10hr/10dr, 10 abs, -35 AC

conical helm: head
-5 cha, -10AC, 5 abs

leather jerkin: on body
-25 AC, 5 abs

long-handled club: s_wield
2d10, -5 cha, 5hr/5dr

dress: about
10hr/10dr, -25 AC, 25 ABS

sandals: feet
10hr/10dr, 1 dex, 10 abs, -15 AC

Armour:

hauberk: on body
25 abs, 15hr/15dr, -50 AC

greaves: legs
30 abs, 10hr/10dr, -50AC

half-piece: on body
15hr/15dr, 50 abs, -125 AC

full-piece, on body
18hr/18dr, 50 abs, -125 AC

Weapons:

a long thin metal sword: d_wield
3d10, 15hr/15dr

a long, thick bladed sword: d_wield
3d9, 10hr/10dr

sabre: s_wield
15hr/15dr, 5d8

axe: d_wield
10hr/25dr, 9d4

warhammer: d_wield
20hr/20dr, 8d4

stiletto: s_wield
10d2, 20hr/10dr

a small dagger: s_wield
15hr/15dr, 3d4

morning star: s_wield
15hr/20dr, 7d5

And thats it...hope you guys can put this to good use...I should have stuck
costs in as well...but oh well.

      <text>Please forgive any errors, its 5:15am here :)
In addition to Kalenth's helpful post, the greaves add 500hitpoints,
and the full-plate chest piece 1000hitpoints. These items, along with
the razor-sharp sword (which costs 5.6million at 30 charisma) are
extremely kick arse. The razor-sharp sword is 10d8, 30hit/dam, 
piercing/stabbing (so can be used for backstabbing) and is duel_wield.
Any errors on stats are on my part, and due to the fact that the sun 
is pecking over my left shoulder :) See you guys. *SMOOCHIES*

      <text>   I am wondering, I heard that Jephrey got fired and one of the reasons
is because he was &quot;abusing&quot; newbiegoto by having it go to the oval...  
Two questions.  Number 1: Should I change my &quot;oval&quot; alias, so as not to
use newbiegoto?  I wasn't aware it was abuse.  And number 2: I can
understand how newbiegoto could be abused in some cases, for instance if I
was using it to go to places hard to arrive at...  But when its a simple
matter of typing either &quot;alias oval newbiegoto 7&quot; as opposed to &quot;alias
oval recall;u;n;w&quot; I don't see how the former would be abuse.  It seems to
me that the former might be less demanding on the server, and have no real
benefit over the latter...  But if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me, and
also...  (reiterates his first question)...  Should I change mine?

      <text>Its a rather simple question, and i'm sorry that I didn't see it
sooner. I'm much used to this board never being used. Anyways,
Jephrey wasn't soley fired because of his abuse of Newbiegoto, but that
isn't here or there to discuss. Abuse of Newbiegoto, truly, was only
made so that NGs in itself could help newbies out a little better. In
direct help with newbies, Newbiegoto Oval would be acceptable. But in
just a handy way to get to Balon or the Oval when nothing is happening?
Pishaw. It isn't likely that i'll catch you using the Oval alias
Pyralin, but in effect, it is abuse. I'd rather prefer that everyone
only use Newbiegoto in such instances that one of you says &quot;Newbiegoto
Donation&quot; and then you follow behind them. As for the question of the
alias, thats an alias. Everyone has access to an alias, but for
Newbiegoto? Not many, so thus, silly little rules.

      <text>While typing random things in an attempt to amuse myself, I stumbled across the list of newbiegoto destinations, and discovered that a few of said destinations are not needed.  I realize that there are much more important things the staff could be doing than removing newbiegoto destinations, but I'm really bored.
2) Entering Deven Ride - What the heck? How is this useful for newbies?
3) Road to Lugard - See above
4) The skilled blacksmith - chances are, one won't be repairing stuff any time between levels one and twenty
5) Caemlyn Pigeon and Courier Service - We can mail from anywhere...no need for this room to even exist
9) The questskill and questspell shop. - if you're old enough to buy fricking questskills, you're old enough to find the shop yourself
10) The Central Square of Far Madding - Again, how is this useful for a newbie?


I do not claim to know everything on this subject, these are just the thoughts of a bored insomniac.  As always, I welcome comments, questions, flames, pats on the back, and medals of honor.

      <text>   Hey Ragnar, I suggested this one to Kalenth :), just because most of
the newbies that I've helped I've took there, its also where I leveled up
when I was at a low level, it just gives really good experience at a low
level and is really useful in my opinion.

      <text>I've been away for a while, so to these postings there shall come a
responce after a little time. To those that I looked at, most of them
were, technically, just ones left over from when Newbiegoto couldn't
be changed without the help of a Coder. But since I, or any Builder
could add Newbiegoto flags, I changed those that were redundant.
The Quest Skills and the Mailing place are now gone, however all the rest
shall stay. There are many reasons for this, so I shall state them here.

1) Lugard - If you had actually gone there you would note that its
the Taxi Stop just outside of Caemlyn. Since newbies really can't afford
to cart everywhere, they can learn the old fashioned way and use the Taxi
system like everyone did once. Hopefully.

2) Deven Ride is a great place that most newbies can run around and kill
some small things for somewhat good gold and experience. As well, its a
good replacement for Caemlyn when one gets tired of that.

3) You might not see many newbies wanting to repair something, but they
do like to repair things. Even if they never use it, it is always there
-for- them if they ever need to.

4) See Deven Ride, but its good for level 20+ newbies to play in.
