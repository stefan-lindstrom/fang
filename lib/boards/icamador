      <text>It came to be this evening that a commotion was created at a local
Inn while an officer of the Children of the Light was beaten by his
lover and soon to be wife. It is said that she didn't lay a hand
upon him, something unseen throwing him back. She fled the Inn after
causing much trouble, men chasing after her calling out, &quot;Witch! Witch!&quot;
Any officers that were close would have heard and reported to fulfill
their duty.. if they heard. Rumors come and go but it seems that a
fairly large group of soliders have departed the city, leaving in the
direction that the girl ran.

      <text>Cataclycism!

In a surprise invasion, the foreign armies of the now known as Seanchan,
have taken The Fortress of the Light and are now in control of Amador.
Those who have not escaped the city have been forced to swear an
oath to their captors but have largely been left alone otherwise.  Trade
still continues although all borders are checked by the insect-like, armor-
clad soldiers and their leashed Aes Sedai.  They are harbingers of the
Dark One!  Our city has fallen and The Children of the Light have scattered
to outlying locales!  It is said that Eamon Valda still lives but has fled the
city with a large company of Children.  Fighting still continues outside of
the capital city and it would appear, if all reports can be trusted-- but there
are many stating this, that Taraboners accompany these dreaded Seanchan
oppressors!  The Fortress has fallen.. fallen to enemy hands.  Our city is
not our own.  Dark times...

To all Amadorians,
     Your country has been reclaimed by the Seanchan Empire, and the
armies of the Corenne are in posesion of the land.  Trade will continue
as normal, but all imported or exported goods must be checked at a border
station.  The Ever Victorious Army is patrolling the streets and country
side for your protection.
     Any information regarding any member of the Children of the Light
should be reported immediately to an officer of the Ever Victorious Army
or the Deathwatch Guard.  There is a five gold mark reward for all true
reports.  Anyone caught aiding the exiles will be executed for treason
against the Empress, may she live forever.

  Signed,
     Captain Aaron son of Garen of the Deathwatch Guard

Citizens of Amador!
    Keep hope!  Though these slaves of the Shadow have triumphed for now,
fear not!  They shall not walk the streets of our city without fear, for
even now those who Serve the Light gather to send them back across the
sea, where they belong!  Do not fear the masters of the shadow-spawned
beasts that terrorize you, or the evil witches who now walk your streets
unashamed, for they will be thrown down!  Down with the Invading Scum!
Down with the Seanchan Tyrants!  For the Children and Amadicia!
