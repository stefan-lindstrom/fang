Recruitment method: Amnesty

He needs a little work, but he'll be ok. Someone drag his butt to the
Golden Bowl and do the flame test. Then ICly get him to the farm and guild
him. Leave me a note and I'll handle the ranks and do the eq when I see
him.

      <text>Muan al'Halien once lived in an old back-country village in Andor.  He spent his days tending
 the sheep, playing the flute idly as he watched over them.  He lived there to the age of 21,
 then he set out to explore the rest of the world.  His parents, of course, did not want him 
to go, still thinking of him as &quot;their baby.&quot;  There was an argument, and finally he left in 
disgust and headed for Caemlyn.  He knows little, as he discovers in Caemlyn.  Gradually, he 
begins to learn of the world outside of Andor. 
 After an encounter with whitecloaks, watching them harassing a man, he readily dislikes them.
  Every once in a while, an ageless face passes by, that of an Aes Sedai, and he shivers.  He 
still cannot forget the tales from home, though he knows that most are baseless.  He likes to 
work hard, but only at what he likes to do.  He wants to eventually apprentice to a craftsman 
someday.  
After hearing the tales of the Dragon Reborn at his home, he views Rand with much awe and no l
ittle fear.  He is half-way handsome, but not enough that the girls sigh over him.  One of his
 faults is his back-countryness, for he still has only a little knowledge of the world.  Howev
er, once he decides on something, he sticks to it, no matter how long it takes.

      <text>Upon hearing of the Lord Dragon, he decided it would be interesting to see if he could channel
.  He fears that he might, but never thinks that he could actually be able to.  He wishes that
 he could find a way to work at something that doesn't totally require physical strength.  As 
it turns out, he can channel, but is only a teachable, not born with the spark.

      <text>I told him everything looked fine in his web app with the exception of
the action in his desc and telling how the person looking at his char
feels.  I've got him Authorized for now, and once he's got the
description changed, hopefully we'll get his recruiting done.

      <text>Somehow Aronin was authorized by someone.  I'm fairly certain it was not me.  I've un-authorized him, as he says he's a wilder, yet has not talked to Tzeentch, nor has he heard of Tzeentch.  Also, he says his character is 16 and knows how to channel without killing himself, because a local wisdom helped him.  If someone else authorized him and wants him to stay authorized, feel free to smack me down and re-authorized him, and flame me.

      <text>Just read through Valios' web app, and was wondering...

What is our current policy on accepting Wilders/Sparkies?  I know that
it was that there was a certain ammount that the guild would take,
but now?

Should we just check with the players to make sure that playing a
Wilder/Sparkie isn't recommended unless they're a more proficient RPer
than the average player?  (ie: Experienced Players only type thing.)

Just curious.

      <text>This is my application for the Black Tower Guild.  1) Character's Full
Name: Talisen Fallon 2) Character's Channeler Type: Teachable 3)
Character's Background Story:Talisen grew up the son of a well-to-do
merchant in a small village about 30 miles outside the capital of Murandy.
From a small age, Talisen was expected to take over his father's business
when he grew older, and was forc ed to spend most of his younger years
trying to increase his intelligence, especially in business.  For most of
his life, Talisen harbored secret feelings of hatred against his parents,
for choosing his life for him.  His parents studiously ignored any h hints
that he gave them, and he would invariably end up where he started.  He
constantly seeks ways to try to anger his parents, or find some little
things that he can make his own decisions in.  He constantly strives to
make choices for himself, and to be on his own.  4) Character's List of
Strengths:Talisen's main strengths are his intelligence and his drive to
succeed.  He is exceedingly smart, often finding solutions to problems
that few others could, or more inventive solutions than any other person.
He also has a strong will to succeed.  He always tries to see his tasks
through to the end, and always tries to do them to the best of his
abilities.  Character's List of Flaws:His weaknesses include arrogance, a
lack of physical strength, and he is also plagued by self doubt.  Talisen
has a trace of arrogance in his blood, which sometimes leads to him
attempting things that he cannot do, and then fail ing.  When he does
fail, it makes him look even worse, and thus he trys to be even more
arrogant to make up for his foolishness.  He also is plagued by self
doubt, which no doubt led to his overabundance of self confidence.  He
also isn't the most physi cally capable person.  Since he spent so much of
his younger years sharpening his mental acumen, he didn't train his body,
and his skills worsened over time.  5)Method of Recruitment: Active
Recruitment
