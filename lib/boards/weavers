      <text>Since the coders no longer have a board in the IMM complex (and I'm
too lazy to zedit this one there) this is a portable board which we can
use to post information about what's being worked on, and any ideas/
suggestions for things which have or have not been implemented.

Just carry this with you, and you can drop it, read it, and get it
again, or load it to a room, or whatever. =P

      <text>There was a small issue.. someone used wolfcall and it summoned mob 
502.  This is the guardian mob for the wolfkin's board and basicly 

caused !look in the oval.  It shouldn't be an issue any longer but if
there was a reason we wanted to be able to call that mob, we'll have
to change it back.

      <text>Ok, the AEDIT patch has been incorporated into the mud source.  If you

are the first one to compile the new source, the new socials file will
have to be installed for this to work.  Just the first warning..

Once the new binary is started, we will lose about half the socials.
This is because we're installing the stock &quot;socials&quot; file that came
with the aedit patch.  However, it will be fairly easy for the people
in the CG_AEDIT to fix everything.

      <text>Warning!!
I'll use this catagory a lot so it can be very spammy at times...
If you use it, too, it'll be even spammier and I encourage you to use
it.  My goals in adding it was to give us a place that will allow us
to set debug messages when we are tracking a problem that we know
exsists but can't reproduce in our test ports (like the guildie-&gt;ch)
 
Use it, but then remove the xlog calls as soon as you don't need them
anymore to help keep the spam to a minimum.  If it's a message that
you probably want up all the time, it should be put into one of the
existing xlog catagories... or a new xlog catagory.
