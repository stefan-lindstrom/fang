Lord Valmar Jagad's body was discovered in his room in the keep. The door
was locked from the inside and had to be broken down to get inside when he
did not answer. The narrow, barred window and sheer wall outside it further
add to the mystery of his death. The only clue is the black-handled knife
found buried in his chest to the hilt. He had just returned from an
unusually long trip. Some say he had been to the blight, others to the
Spine of the World. He was very closemouthed about where he had been. His
drunken servant let slip the night before he died that they had found
&quot;something.&quot; He would say no more, though. Shortly after news of Valmar's
death spread through the city, the servant disappeared.

      <text>Rumors flew of a Fade attack in the heart of the keep.  The actual events
have now been hushed, but another set of funeral preparations have begun
with full military honors - for a visitor no less.  It couldn't have been
a fade...  Perhaps it was another assasination.  Right?

It has been declared to all Nobility and all that can be availible for the event.


To all it may concern.

       There will be a gathering at the Bashere residence located in Fal Dara. In a fort night's time.  Entertainers, drinks, refreshments, all that the mind can develop in a picture will be seen at this event.  All you need to do is show with an escort, or by your lonesome and enjoy the festivities....




(The real date for my little party is on thursday night, at about 8pm CST or 9pm CST.  I'd hope to see you all there, especially the pretty women...Look your best :P...Te'sai is on the prowl *meow* :P)
