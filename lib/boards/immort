      <text>I'm the new owner and hostess of Fang.
Also, I am very thankful for this opportunity to serve Fang in a new way.
If any of you are wondering if anything will change the answer is I very much hope so. I hope we have less lag and router difficulties with the new move. As to everything else, Fang will continue to operate as it has in the past. 
I do not run Fang, that is the Cre's job. I just want to say that here so that is very clear to everyone.
While it is important for all immies to know what is going on and that I am the Owner/Hostess, this is not something that needs to be common knowledge to the players. It is not a secret but I think it would make my life and the life of others here much easier if it were not brought up and discussed with players. I do not want to be bothered by some who may want different things I've no intention of doing.
My main position here is as a Builder, its the thing I enjoy the most and hope to continue in that regards for a long time. I've asked that my title remain Builder and that my level stay the same since its all I really need in order to do my job here as a Builder. I'm telling you this so you are aware I will not be able to set people or other such things that has never been my job here and of which I do not have an interest in learning. 

I very much hope you all will enjoy Fang's new home.

Ainge, Builder

      <text>My thoughts - don't screw up stuff. It's mostly that simple. We're not
Tyme, we're not any of those others, we are us. One draw to anything is
that you find the point of heightened activity, conflict, or interest
and you market that. Confining the Rebels to their camp or to Salidar
is pretty much a bad idea. Merging the towers is even worse. You want
conflict. People scream they want treaties and they want this and that
but if this were a peaceful place, why would we even sign in? The most
difficult thing to do is progress to a point where it becomes unknown
territory or there is no story. The appeal of Fang has been that it is the
WoT.. we haven't made it what we wanted, we kept it like it was.. the
books. So pushing people off into something that sounds good in theory,
is often a bad idea in outcome. Not to mention, you have every situation
to consider, the personal roleplay, what it will do, what it won't do,
how to correct the possible problems (and you won't see them all), not
to mention, coordinating it all. Looks easy. Is it? *shake*

&amp;r-&amp;wDanielle&amp;n

It really isn't that difficult to find RP and RP usually does not depend
upon what Rand al'Thor is doing. 99% of us wouldn't even be involved ICly.

      <text> All immortals are subject to this post and will be held responsible for
having read and followed it. Any direct violation of what is stated or
instructed here will be punishable by immediate loss of immortal character.

Porshia posted about her exploits with a minor and said that it was a ruse
to prove that imms snoop. However it happened, it is now a known fact that
she distributed porn to a minor. This isn't something to look away from, it
is not something to encourage, and anyone caught doing so will be deleted.

Porshia's characters are going to be deleted as well as her roommates. We
can't justify not doing so due to character sharing and such. Along with
that, two IP addresses will be banned, two that the player uses from home.
She is no longer allowed to play here. Her rights have been revoked.

In order to address the issues of laws, we are not accepting this issue
to be debated in public forum. We do not wish to do this, but it is simply
what we have to do as the post on the OOC board indicates. Therefore, as
the staff of this game, you are to mute any topic on global discussion that
pertains to this incident or subject activity. What that means? If a mort
decides to bring it up on OOC or any other global channel, they are to be
muted. Period. We cannot regulate private discussion, but as far as open
discussion, we can. Each one of you is responsible for seeing this done.
The OOC board has also been set to level 200. This means morts can't post
for a few days to be sure that the majority of talk about this will be
kept to a minimum. If a mort comes to you and wants a post made that is
legit, then post it. If they engage you in conversation about the specifics
of this subject, tell them you are very sorry but you are not at liberty
to discuss it. Or deny knowing about it. Either/or and your method is your
method. However, the point remains, you are not to discuss it.
save

Basically, the OOC board says the majority. We didn't want to, but in the
interest of the game, there was no alternative.

      <text>For any of the GLs that build in their guild etc, etc
Please remember a few things: Captialize the Letters in the room title, double check and make sure your spelling is accurate, and check your room when you finish with it to make sure it looks like you envisioned it.
This little guideline is true if you happen to be assigned to build in other areas as well.
And NEVER EVER use the word YOU in a desc or title.
If you got questions of a general nature reguarding building you can ask me, otherwise please inquire of the Head Builder, Tzeentch. He knows everything I don't and more.

Thanks for ya'lls cooperation,

      <text>I altered the process for talent applications.  If you would
check out HELP TALENTS, you'll get the idea of what I've
done and it's actually fairly definitive too (finally).  I also
editted the other helpfiles related to talents and you'll
probably notice that &quot;help talent_board&quot; still exists however,
it is wizlocked and 203+ viewable, players should not be
using that helpfile.  It will likely be removed but for now I've
just hidden it so to speak.  Depending on the talents you
receive applications for, and based on what the helpfile
says, I would appreciate some communication to both
myself and Amarinda when the talent is a more obscure
or strange one.  Meaning we don't need to hear about BT
guildies being set with travelling, but something odd and
uncommon, we'd like to know about before approving the
application.

Thanks :)

      <text>If you read 'handbook' it gives job descriptions. I'm going to post that
here. Some things I want to stress.

Guildleader: Your job is simply to run your Guild. You must play at least 
10 hours a week. The guild is yours. You decide what the ranks and help 
files are, and what your guildeq looks like. The guild zone is yours as 
well, but any changes must be okayed by the Headbuilder. You must have no 
less than 4 eq for every single rank in your guild. You should try to have 
regular guild meetings. You should run guild quests, with the same rules 
applying as normal quests (see Quest Policy) . You should promote roleplay 
and try to make your guild ICly respectable. You will not try to have the 
strongest eq or skills. All new skills must be agreed upon by the Creator 
and Weaver imms. Your only focus is your guild, nothing more. Only you can 
make the guild fun, full of people and a presence in the mud.

Now, first point - &quot;You must play at least 10 hours a week.&quot;  This is
because you are needed. I expect this to be followed. I know life happens
and I'm willing to work with people that need it, but otherwise, I want
you here and active. For those not making 10 hours or it's been a while
since they've logged in, I'm mailing with a time period. No response, no
imm.

Second - &quot;You should promote roleplay and try to make your guild ICly
respectable.&quot; We all want to be respected and we don't want our guildies
to face snickering, right? .. promoting roleplay .. Promote. Period.

As always, if you have questions or issues with this, talk to me.

      <text>&amp;WMy notes and comments in bold white.&amp;n
&amp;c*************************************************************************&amp;n
&amp;C6.&amp;w  All players have the right to privacy. An Immortal may not snoop or
    sit in rooms invisible simply for recreation without a GOOD reason(s)
    and only after announcing it to the appropriate person/people.
    -
    Snnoping should be used only if concerned a player is cheating, to
    watch code troubles, or to evaluate roleplay.
    -
    If you're watching roleplay or checking bugs, ask the player before
    snooping. If you're snooping because you suspect he/she's cheating,
    inform either an admin IMM or announce it via wiznet and discuss it
    with other IMMs first.
&amp;c*************************************************************************&amp;n
&amp;C7.  &amp;wDon't harass morts for amusement. Don't set their titles, force
    them to say things, pkill them, spam them with socials or sends, or
    load aggressive mobs to their rooms.
&amp;c*************************************************************************&amp;n
&amp;C10. &amp;wDo not stat eq or mobs or players and give out that info to the
    players, including your own alts (that is, don't stat for stats).
    There is a reason are commands like consider, test, and appraise. Do
    not give info about one player to another, such as if he/she is a DF.
&amp;WI will go as far as to include telling someone who a player's alt would be.
&amp;c*************************************************************************
&amp;C11. &amp;wTransfer and teleport are reserved for OOC reasons when you need a
    player to be in your room to chat with, or are running a quest or a
    guild event. Do not use them to help players get to roleplay sites,
    to go find eq, or kill mobs. We have very extensive travelling commands
    (cart, gate, skim, guildwalk, speedwalk, run, seek, recall, etc.) for
    this purpose.
&amp;WThis includes your own alts.&amp;n
&amp;c*************************************************************************
&amp;C16. &amp;wUse gecho, at &lt;command&gt;, send, page, and other such commands
    sparingly. We are not here to spam each other and the players.
&amp;WGLs would be helped by using gecho for guild advertisements, but keep
all gechoes to a minimum. Morts don't have a choice in seeing these as well
as the other commands mentioned.
&amp;c*************************************************************************
&amp;C18. &amp;wIssues discussed exculsively with immortals should remain at that
    level. It is strictly prohibited to copy/paste wiznet to mortals and
    copy/paste posts from IMM boards to mortals. This is a cause for
    deIMMing. Mortals should -never- hear about IMM business. Mortals are
    here to play the game, not to get involved in admin/IMM issues. Do
    not tell mortals about IMM politics, admin issues, or any Imm business.
    Ever.
&amp;WThink perhaps we've seen this one play into the scheme of things?&amp;n
&amp;c*************************************************************************
&amp;C19. &amp;wThe wiz channel is an open discussion forum, but should not be
    used to bash anyone who cannot hear it. As immortals, you should be
    above petty flaming.
&amp;c*************************************************************************
&amp;WQuestions and comments can be directed to me. This stuff is
already in Fang's policy files. Know them all.&amp;n

      <text>Policy with nobility is a little outdated but it's been a problem for
a little while now. So, here's the post to clear up any/all problems.

I'm addressing GLs with this because there are specifics that you should
be aware of and things that you must think about. Nobility titles are
only allowed on the bookie imms that have an IC presence and that have
earned the nobility title. This means that Prophet, M'Hael, and General
are allowed because they are bookies and are around IC. Those that are
not bookies will not have nobility titles. This is a tool for the Houses
GL and the SC GL, but only them, and only for the mort players. It is
not to be abused, not to be set for good time's sake, and not to make
a statement. True, this applies to all imms due to the problems in the
past, but since we do have bookies that are GLs, you should be aware of
the stipulation that alters this slightly.

If you have questions, please talk to me. I don't intend on making any
GLs bookies during my time of hiring GLs. It's worked before and I don't
have a problem with those that are currently around AS LONG as those
bookies are played.

      <text>In light of the new policies regarding material that is discussed
publicly, I'd like the IMM GLs to keep the majority of their channels
on. It is your job to police these channels and enforce policies and
you cannot do that if you're unaware of what's going on. Also, I would
like for you to keep the question channel on at all times. What if they
were to ask about how to join your guild? You'd miss it. We're supposed
to help newbies and that's where they are directed to ask their
questions. If you have questions, see me. I can understand some 
circumstances and want to be aware if there are problems with this.

      <text>I just wanted to point out that Amarinda does say &amp;umajority&amp;n
of channels be kept on.  The reason why I bring this up is
because I know not everyone is entertained by obscene.
Also, I get a little sick of hearing victim statements about
how &quot;God forbid I have a channel off.&quot;, or something of
that nature.  Just remember that everyone has the same
expectation placed upon them.  Also remember that our
variety of channels exists for a reason and they are meant
to be dedicated to certain content.  Feel free to nudge
spammy players off of certain channels if they're technically
misusing them.  I know I do.

We have a spiffy bit of new code to play with. It's called dynvars. I 
think that stands for dynamically variable descriptions... anyway, what it
does is allows us to vary descriptions based on time of day, type of
weather, or abilities of the person who is looking. It can be applied to
rooms, mobs or objects and to the exdescs on them, as well. Stefan has
provided a tutorial (and a better explanation) along with some examples at

http://www.dragonsfang.org/coder/embed/

Check it out. This is a neat little thing that allows us to add extra bits
of description that someone will see if he is wolfkin or grasping the
source or if it is daytime or whatnot. If you have any questions, ask Stefan
or me and we'll be glad to try to answer.

      <text>I come to you as a concerend player of the Dragons Fang.  The game is a
great one, however, those that have come to power, have become greedy
power-mongers like unto the dreadlords.  The funny thing is that the few
members of staff that have not become greedy power-mangering assholes who
commit injustice just because they can, are those who lead the DreadLords.
I have some specific names.  One player inpeticular(as the leader of the
Asha'man) likes to set his track with an &quot;alias&quot; mechanism to keep killing
players so that they cannot even play the game.

Please address this concern of mine.  I worry much about the status
of the game dropping even further down the hole it lies in.  This is a great MUD,
I can honestly say that it is the best MUD I have ever played.  And i do not
want it to be destroyed by the same ass-holes that destroy all the other good games.

Now, I am telling this to you because I would rather you solve the
conflict, instead of me, If i have to solve the conflict, there will be
hacking involved, and a large loss of information regarding the guilds.  
Now, again, i do not want this to happen, but I care enough about this
threatening it, I will.

Thank you for your time!

*** I guess this is from Darck.... Spoke with Alani about this briefly last
night and the impression I got was he was being &quot;tolerated&quot; as much as
possible despite threatening Immortals and generally harassing people.
I dunno about you guys, but the idea that he would hack us to make a
point (I'd like to see him try that) is right up there with &quot;molested@Christian.org&quot;
as an email address in terms of hilarity.
Anyways, MUDmails about this would be appreciated if anyone knows a
little more about it.  I get the sense that it doesn't matter how much I
know if/when I actually talk to this character but I figure it'd help to speed
up the process of kicking his ass :P

Will

PS- This guy sent some nonsensical emails to the FangRPlogs account
as well.  They just.. didn't make any sense at all.

      <text>Jephrey popped on AIM to ask me to check and see if Darck/Palan was/were
multiplaying.  I logged on, saw that they were, and sent two messages to
Darck asking him to limit himself to one character at a time.  I received
no reply, but he continued to kill mobs.  I then sent a message to palan
asking if he was a friend of Darck's.  I received no reply to this either.
I proceeded to gecho in &amp;&amp;R that multiplaying was illegal.  Still nothing,
so I DCed Darck.  I tried to ban him, but I couldn't figure out how to
hack into the pfiles and change my level to 211.  Then I figured, &quot;why not
just stalk him?  &quot; but that didn't work either, because I don't know where
he lives.  So I gave up and went to eat candy.

      <text>Gah! I hate these things. So, um, right. Ice cream.

You know who I am so I'll leave out the really boring part and skip right
to the eyerolling part. It's about time to have some friggin fun! Yes, I
am guilty of having been strict in the past but let's start entertaining.
I'd like for the immortals to have fun and be entertaining in such a way
that the morts don't feel like we aren't approachable and like we are 
only here in a policing manner. That's not it at all. We're here to give
them what they want to some degree - fun and entertainment. You can do
that. I know all of you on staff pretty well and you guys can do so much
by just being here, being responsive, and participating in silly stuff
with the morts or just engaging them in conversation. Please try it just
for a few days and see if things don't immediately start to perk up.

Suggestions - if you see a newbie log on with a bad name.. instead of
perhaps jumping them right away, welcome them to fang. Instruct them
on how to reply because I've learned that they don't always just know
how to use reply. Chat with 'em and then ask about the name. Or if it
is a good name - just make sure they're somewhat at ease with getting
to know the game. Kalenth can probably offer a lot of suggestions when
it comes to newbies. And don't limit it there.. if you see a long time
player having a rough time, simply inquire as to what's going on. One
smiling face can make a big difference. And doing little things like
this isn't just one-sided - if you can help someone with a problem or
you can put them at ease, then you feel better about what's going on.

A lot of times we dwell on the negative. We have been doing this for quite
some time, now. Let's try to reverse that as much as we can because I was
dead serious when I said it's a very important time. Instead of bitching
because things fell through on something in the past, think about what
-could- happen now that we're not in some sort of stalemate. We're not.
Some of us like to hold on to past grievances, myself included. Now isn't
the time for that because we have a game, we have a home that we need to
take care of sorta like you'd water a plant. Let go of it and get excited
about what is ahead because it is as exciting as we make it.

You know where to find me. Let me be there.
I'll be posting more in the upcoming days.

      <text>I'd like some thoughts on the role of large wild animals in roleplay.
I'm not talking someone NPC'ing something like tigers destroying a
riding party - I mean converting them into pets. I'm not inclined to
go with it but I'm always willing to listen to the other side so get
to talking. This needs to be worked out because of the hesaid/shesaid
issues that continue to mount.

I can see places where such things would make sense in RP. Ok, a place,
not places, but still. The menagerie is still part of the Entertainer's
Guild, right? But... then again, it's not really out of place to have
animals in the circus. I wish it was a thing that could have a hard and
fast ruling, but like most things in RP, it's a matter of whether it
makes sense for the situation the player wants to put it in.

      <text>I don't think it's very feasible for joe randlander to have a large wild animal as a pet.  First of all, they are called &quot;large wild animals.&quot;  Note the word &quot;wild,&quot; which the Mirriam-Webster dictionary defines as, &quot;Living in a state of nature and not ordinarily tamed or domesticated.&quot;  Secondly, it must be pointed out that the average character on this mud doesn't really have the background knowledge necessary to successfully domesticate a large wild animal.  Writing a background and then adding, &quot;Oh, and I also studied with the circus for three years just before joining the &lt;guildname&gt;, so I know how to train bears&quot; seems like bullshit to me.
That said, if a player wants to dedicate a significant amount of his character's life to the training and research required to tame a large wild animal, the possibility should at least be considered before being denied.  So I guess my vote is to look at everyone on a case-by-case thing.

      <text>And thus it was decided that bookies should be handled by immortals.
To take it one step further, don't hire any. We're not looking to fill
the bookie positions with players.

      <text>Mmkay. I tried to update this file as best I could. Please read over it
and let me know of anything that has been overlooked or left out.

I re-wrote a few for clarification.
I changed the responsible parties on a few.
I removed the policies dealing with bookies.
I added in that herons could not be tooled or crafted.
I added in a comment about mort GLs not sharing their pfile.
I changed the 48 hour healing rule for gentling to 24.

I think that's the basic stuff I did. May not be remembering it all.
As I said, if there needs to be more, let me know. I'll work on the
crap that currently says, &quot;SPACE FOR RENT&quot; as soon as I can.

-- Btw, I have the old file on my harddrive for reference. It isn't
gone completely in case there are problems/questions.

      <text>Kristen and Carl were logged from the same IP last night. It's an
IP similar to Rhuroc's (144.139.171.093) but I have no idea if 
they were the same person. Kristen had been listed as canmulti
but Carl said they were the same. Once I DC'd Kristen, Carl became
upset and ended up leaving with OOCing, &quot;F**** you all!&quot; or some
such. All these the same person or..?

      <text>Over the course of an hour or so, Kalenth and I did several tests to
determine whether or not Rhuroc and Kristen are the same person.  As far
as I know, every single test proved inconclusive.  I even tried the one
where one character counts up while the other counts down.  Amazingly
enough, they started dropping links during the test.  In my professional
opinion, Rhuroc and Kristen are the same person.  In addition, I find
Rhuroc to be obnoxious and crude despite the fact that I've asked him
several times to settle down.  If one of you administrative types wants to
ban him the next time he plays two characters at once, you have my
blessing and my thanks.

      <text>I'd rather not ban the kid because he is 12 and most of us were monsters
at that age but whatever gets the point across. If he can't learn and
this continues, put him in the hole and leave him there. He'll likely
get the hint and if not, then the last resort is banning.

      <text>POLICY QUESTS has been fully updated. Please take the time to read it
and be familiar with it. I think it's pretty clear on what's allowed
and what's not down to the awards that are given to you guys for
doing the different types of quests.

In addition, I added to a Storyteller to the staff (stating it on
a board since I was pouted at :p). I know this is a rather freakish
thing since it's been so long since we had one, but let's have fun
both with her and the new possibilities. If you have ideas, discuss
them with her if you don't have the time or need someone to do something
for you. I have a feeling she's pretty open to anything and everything.

The guildleaders may need to take the time to talk to her spcifically
about any rights to NPCs that may or may not be common (I can already
think of someone that will want trollocs and I'll eat my socks if it
isn't brought up again soonish). Basically.. it may just be a good
idea for everyone to take the time out to talk to Deanna. I think it'd
be beneficial to everyone.

Hm, the policy points to a help file that needs updating. I'm going to
do that as soon as I have something else drawn up that's a day late.

      <text>I'd appreciate it if we could cut back on the time idling afk and/or
invis. I understand leaving and not getting back and all but I think
this is happening too much. The flags were changed so that they don't
stick through a crash so being automatically reconnected after a 
crash or some such will not save the flags.. at which time, you're
just unresponsive to anyone that needs you. And it's difficult for
people to catch you here if you're invis. Again, remember that we
are here for them, not the other way around.

Thanks.
