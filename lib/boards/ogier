      <text>Heyas all :)

You get these skills at guilding:
\c02Ogier\c00 (language), Old Tongue (language), Unarmed Combat

\c02Treesingers\c00 get \c02Treesinging\c00 when they reach the \c02Treesinger\c00 rank.

Crafters get Repair when they reach the Crafter rank.

Teachers get Trolloc when they reach the Teacher rank.

Soldiers get Stun when they reach the Soldier rank.

As it is know the \c22Builders\c00 don't have a skill but they'll
have a nice one in the future.

      <text>well, since noone seems to have a copy of Halar's old posts, I decided to
do a search on the web. I don't recommend this. 'Ogier' seems to be a
french surname. Anyhow, the best sight i came up with is:
http://www.d.umn.edu/#knovek/wotc/wotc31.html

It mostly points you to appropriate sections of the books though...

      <text>I am the Story Designer, Ainge.  And that is what I do, help design stories to be Role Played out.  Currently I am seeking ALL Ogiers who would like some RP to mudmail me.  This RP would begin with the Tinkers...but would not end there.  The Tinkers are going to be having a festival called the Festival of the Leaf and it is where they celebrate and spread the Way of the Leaf as they seek their song.  Now, your RP would be about building structures like stages, booths etc for the Tinker Festival.
This RP is part of a series  of set up or pre RP events leading up to the main RP event of the Festival of the Leaf.  The main purpose of course is to increase the RPing between guilds and help you to have a good time and better enjoy your alt.
The Tinkers will be beginning this preliminary setup RP on Saturday Jan 6 at 7pm CST.  They will be finding a fabulous object that will evolve and figure promeniently in the main RP event.  So if you want to be included in the Sat night RP mudmail me as well about that.  You'd just need a reason to be hanging out with the Tinkers, and that reason is to assist them in building stages and chairs and whatnot for their festival of the Leaf.

So let me hear from you.  Even if you don't want to play your ogier but want to be in this RP let me know.  There is always room for NPC types.
Thanks,

Ainge, Story Designer

      <text>You might have noticed the new look of the recall room.  I have decided
to make links to all of the connected Stedding through this room, under
the assumption that all &amp;yOgier&amp;n know where most Stedding are and how
to get to them.  So far, only Jinsuin and Taijin are connected.  
Taijin is north of here, and Jinsuin is the door to the south.  Jinsuin
is located near the Aiel waste, just south of the Jaingai Pass.  If you
know of any other Stedding that are currently connected, or ones that
you would like to see connected, please post or mudmail me!
 
Thats all for now.

      <text>it seems that i cannot go south to stedding jinsuin, for some reason
i get recalled every time i try with the message: you do not belong here
let daddy take you home... Rather bothersome in length.

Then i was wondering where stedding shangtai has gone? it is around s
omewhere or atleast it was... but i cannot find it anymore. I wouldnt
mind to get it back since RP'ish i am born there :)

i do recall a stedding more though i cannot remember the name of it.

      <text>Presently, I am in the works for some nifty new gskills.  I think you
will like them, as they are a mixture of cool ideas.  I don't know when
they will be coded, but since I moonlight as a &amp;GWeaver&amp;n I shall make an
extra effort to see them coded quickly.
 
As you may have noticed, I have changed the ranks slightly.  These new
ranks are more WoT-ish in my opinion.  
 
One last thing, I hope to have the link to Stedding Shangtai up as soon
as possible, I have already built it, but it has not come across as yet.
Also, I have built houses for the Masters of each rank.  Since I don't 
forsee the need for more than one, you can share with your fellow Masters.
Once the houses are brought over, I will be handing out the keys.  All of
the houses are located in Stedding Shangtai, but they can be moved with
the concent of all who dwell there!  ;-)
 
Thats all for now!

      <text>AFAIK there's already a Shangtai. It was the one in the Waste.
Jinsuin is located in the Mountains of Mist, and was linked (rather
convolutedly) to the Two Rivers area. I took a few TR guildies up
there for RP from time to time.

I think there was another Stedding floating about, but which one is
was, I cannot be sure.
This is just going on my shady memories from my active days...

      <text>I have requested the following skills for the Ogier Guild.  They are
currently awaiting the HGL's approval, and then will be sumitted to the
coding staff for implementation...  someday.  Every guild member will
have at least 3 skills, 2 from their division and long stride.  Above
and beyond those, any guild member may eventually choose as many as four
more skills, up to the limit of 7 per character.  The ogier language will
not count toward that limit.

Treesinger Guildskills:

Treesing - target un-enhanced wooden item resists item damage, and gains &lt;3-5 hr/dr, and 5-10 ac/abs&gt; based upon current building values.  If equipment is ever rescaled, this skill ought to be as well.

Embrace Nature - This skill is like the spell 'sanctuary' which speeds up the heal rate, but this skill would of course only affect the user. Also, it would be more effective if the user was outdoors.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Builder Guildskills:

Wall - as CotL 'fortify' skill.

Honor to the Builders - Ogier with this skill would experience a major reduction in cost at shops, and wouldn't be affected by human type aggro mobs.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Soldier Guildskills:

Overbear - A character with this skill would automatically gain 50 abs during combat, and would additionally be able to use the command &quot;overbear &lt;target&gt;&quot;, which would operate as a damaging attack with a bash-like property, dealing approximately double attack damage, and preventing the target from attacking in the next round.

Slow Temper - An Ogier character with this skill, on first entering combat, would be set with a flag to represent his rising ire, much like a stormshield or sos, it would record reductions in his hitpoints, as well as elapsed time.  When it expired, either through damage or time, it would set a second affectation, which would give 1Xattack and heavy hr/dr bonuses.  After its expiration, the Ogier would begin again with the original counter, rebuilding to the full height of their temper...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Scholar Guildskills:

Knowledge - (currently is coded, but not an Ogier gskill)

Naturalist - Using the consider command would reveal the target's maximum and current hitpoints, mana, and moves, as well as NPC flags...  perhaps in some sort of converted language?

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Miscellaneous Guildskills:

Long Stride - This skill would reduce the move cost between any two rooms to 1, cut all carting/taxi costs in half, and seriously increase the regeneration of movement points.

      <text>It's use is IC only.
Examples of decent, &quot;IC&quot; situations:
&amp;ro&amp;n You roleplay singing a staff from a tree, and then sing a staff
  item codewise.
&amp;ro&amp;n Someone brings you a wooden item ICly, and you &quot;discover&quot;
  that it is, indeed, sung.  You may then sing it codewise.

      <text>Ogiers BIG and small:

A quick little announcement:
Following in the footsteps of Lucian (post 20) and Demian (21) I 
would like to echo that singing is IC.  To make sure we keep it 
this way I would like to ask that whenever an item is sung, to 
please mail me the item, person it was sung for, and IC reason.  
If you send a log that would be great and you'd be rewarded for 
good RP also :) 

Thanks All,
Gaurav

      <text>I have to object to this policy.  I had a long conversation about it
with several people today and reasoned out my arguments against it.  I'm
not trying to be a rebel and I'm not going to break the policy as long
as it stands, but if you would, please give a little thought to this.

As I was discussing today, I reasoned there were two factors that brought
about the policy originally.  One was that the skill is very powerful,
capable of boosting stats on equipment permanently and setting the !break
flag.  The second was that the skill was abused.  So, instead of adressing
the problem directly, a policy was implemented putting a ban on OOC use of
the skill.

There were several alternatives to this that seemed wiser to me, though not
to everyone.  The first was that the skill itself should be restricted.  It
should be like Gate: you must earn it ICly through several RP sessions and
prove yourself worthy of getting it.  This would have prevented the abuse
directly, as only the most responsible and able players, ICly and OOCly,
would even have access to the skill.  This seemed the wisest move to me.

The second alternative that came to mind immediately was that the skill's
power be reduced.  The main reason that most people want the skill is for
the !break flag.  That keeps one from having to ever spend money to repair
and also enables one to use enhance without worry.  Though I didn't like
the solution, it would solve the problem.

The issues I have with policy as it stands is that it is so easy to break
and that I can't easily take hold of the one skill that I got after
becoming an Ogier.  This is selfish and greedy, but the mud is based off of
personal intrest.  The first policy I proposed would take care of the abuse
problem while still allowing those deemed worthy to reap the benefits of
the skill without the hassle of having to RP every time.

Sorry to dump this on you so soon after your instatement, Gaurav, but your
post reminded me of the grudge I've long held against this policy.  That
and the fact that I'm feeling just especially argumentative today.

      <text>Hey Haran sorry to somewhat attack your idea (it is a good one)
but the policies have their good points too. Policy is sorta like when
you are spanked if you break policy you get a little scolding.
The policy is not really there to restrict the ability too much but to
get rp going...yes they have put restrictions on it in the policy but
they make sence like it being wooden and all is a good idea even though
there are not to many wooden items people use in the mud. Even though
I think your idea is good I also like the policy too they both have
their merit and their flaws so it is a good idea to let Gaurav know
your idea but you should also look at the good points of the policy
along with the bad and weigh it to your idea.

P.S.
Sorry to somewhat attack your idea (it is good) but I feel that both
sides should be argued to make sure the guild best interest are put
first...give the Gl something to think about 
(Make the Lazy people work. Be it Gl or Guildee)
Just what I am thinking at the moment

      <text>Hello ALL,
&amp;n
Let's see if I can reply to post 25 and 26 without ruffling any feathers here.  However before I make my points why we should have this policy allow me to point out one simple thing A Sung items is special to every Ogier.   With that in mind I find it hard to justify allowing anyone to play the part of a Sung Pimp (poor choice of words but the point is made).
&amp;n
Breaking down the points from posts 25 &amp; 26 I see that:
1. Why was this policy made?
2. Alternatives to the Policy
3. Problems with policy
4. Few items to actually sing IC 
&amp;n
Well please allow me to address them in order I have listed.  
&amp;R
1. Why was this policy made?
Haran is correct OOC'ly this is a powerful skill, which bumps ac, abs, hit, damage and prevents the item from every breaking.  Coupling this skill with the enhance skill switches a common every day item into a very good one.  Although that alone does not raise any flags in my eyes.  Why?  In my eyes this is the Ogiers version of channeling therefore it should be powerful.  When an Ogier sings to a tree the items gained are gifts from the tree.  They are created from the tree without damage to it.  That in itself is a wondrously boggling concept.  Think of it like this, the joy of creation without harming anything.  To me this is very special.
However the abuse of the skill is/was something very real here on fang.  I have seen Ogiers who are still active in our guild sing items for people without so much as a RP session, and in the center of Caemlyn nonetheless.  As one of my alts I paid 1k an item for a total of 10k (10 items) in the center of Caemlyn and had a very nice sung eq kit.  Was this fun for anyone but my alt who wanted to level?  I do not think so.  Although I will admit it did make the Ogier some money, and perhaps raise his skill slightly.
&amp;R
2. Alternatives to the policy
The idea of limiting who gets treesinging is something I was considering adding to the policy when I posted it, however I wanted to speak with the guild before I put that in.  My idea is pretty simple.  The guild rank of treesinger at the moment has 3 subranks, which I would like to change to 4.  The new subranks would be Innate, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master.  Adjusting the treesinging skill to fit each person I figured that we could set the skill at:&amp;c
Innate: Treesinging 1%
Apprentice: Treesinging 25%
Journeyman: Treesinging 50%
Master: Treesinging 90%&amp;R
Thus through RP with a Journeyman or Master the Innate/Apprentice can gain IC understanding of the skill and move on to the next skill level.  The Journeymen RP would be his own leading her/him someday to become a master in the art of Treesinging.  The key here is Role-playing.  Since this guild is a RP guild, the knowledge of the skill should be RP'ed.  To help in this I will contact the current Treesingers and try to set up a syllabus for treesinging.
Personally though I do not see power reduction for this skill doing anything to change my mind about how it should be used.  As I stated earlier in this post, the Sung items should be special to Ogiers since the skill is not as common today as it was in the Age of Legends.&amp;n

3. Problems with Policy
Using real life as example you can break any law/policy/standard you wish.  When you break it most likely you will not get caught.  So why follow them?  Respect for what they stand for.  This policy does not hinder anyone from treesinging an IC item, however it does simply state that you RP doing it.  Adding too that common sense (like a tree can not make a metal breastplate) we arrive at where the policy stands today.
On the issue of reduction of personal fun, I cannot honestly share my thoughts on that, since each person defines her/his own fun.  However I can pose a couple of questions and we can see how I line up with your answers:  
&amp;rWhy is singing an item fun when you only get paid? &amp;YFor me it would not be.
&amp;rDoes lack of RP = Fun? Or does RP = Fun?  &amp;YI would pick the second.
&amp;rAre there creative ways to get around the singing policy and still follow it to the letter? &amp;YYes.
&amp;R
4. Few items to actually sing IC
That is correct.  There is a limitation with everything.  Channelers must grasp the one power to perform their weaves, well my furry-eared friends
we must embrace a tree to accomplish our magic.  With that said, a creative person could find ways a sung item could be more readily found.  A few ideas here a wooden charm worn on a necklace or on a bracelet, perhaps a wooden bowl, maybe wooden shield? Those are just a few ideas I thought up in 10 seconds, think about what could be accomplished with 30 minutes of RP.
&amp;n
&amp;n
My goal here was not to attack each point however it does seem like what I have done.  Please allow me to offer a very honest apology for that.  It was neither my goal in starting nor my goal in finishing this post to do so.
&amp;n
Thanks for you time, and let me know if this made any sense (wrote this last night at 4a.m.).

      <text>Ok, so I'll lay down my crusade against the policy for the present.

However, I do have problems with syallabi and the Ogier.  I'm too lazy
to try to write this post out and reread it before posting, so bear with
me here.

1) My first thought immediately goes to lack of RP.  There are two main
factors in this.  1- There are hardly any active Ogier.  So you'll
suggest that I find RP outside of the Ogier, which brings about my second
problem. 2- Ogier almost never leave the Stedding and humans very rarely
enter them.  These two coupled together makes it very hard to get true
IC RP.  It can be circumvented, but its a rather meta-game way of thinking.

2) Ogiers, unlike humans, live incredibly long lifespans and therefore have
the opportunity to branch out in several directions of study.  Syllabi lock
people into a singular proffesion and a rigid caste like system.  Personally,
I don't even like the categories reflected in ranks.  Ogier often had great
masonry knowledge -and- a huge amount of knowlegde. 

Loial is the perfect example, pre-Rand.  He knew much about building, so
one could consider him as a builder.  However, he also had a fairly strong
ability to Treesing.  Next to that, he was insanely well-read and versed.
Now you'll probably say that using Loial as an example is like using Rand
as an example, but before he got involved, he lived a very normal Ogier life.

Ok, I've rambled enough. Syllabi bad.

      <text>Haran,
&amp;n
You are correct that Ogiers have a life span that is staggering in comparison to their human counterparts.  However I think you are very wrong about Loial being anything but exceptional before he met Rand.    The two clues I see Jordan giving us that Loial is an exceptional person is 1. He devotes large chunks of the books to him (unlike Jarel a WC who is seen in one book for a few pages), and 2. He has a gift that is described as rare in the present day (treesinging).  Also Jordan does one thing we do not do here on Fang.  For every Ogier that is exceptional (Loial) he also gives us one that is unfortunate (Trayal, the Ogier who was a Treesinger but lost his minds in the ways). 
Now about your feeling that the average Ogier would know his history, building, and treesinging all together.  In a lot of ways I could not agree with you more.  Simple math tells us if the average human life span in RJs world is around 70 and the average Ogier lives to 600 dividing both by max ages by 3.8 (for the age of maturity) we find humans right at 18ish and Ogiers at 157ish years (although somewhere I think the books imply the Ogier age of maturity at around 100-120 but since I couldnt find it I just worked up a little thing).  So by the time an Ogier is at the age of maturity s/he could have legitimately read a bulk of masterpieces of the time, studied art, language, architecture, political science, pop culture, and restaurant management.  One the other hand does studying something give us the practical knowledge to use it or just an appreciation of the subject matter when it is used?  I would argue the latter, since I have B.F.A. in Theatre performance from a leading Theatre school in the US and spent time at another University in Canada studying under one of the most well know improve teachers of the 20th century, but I cant act for crap.  I have a great understanding of what goes into the craft of acting, yet I was simply not blessed with the inner light that shines through a truly gifted artist.
Role-playing options are not limited because of the Ogier race.  Instead RP options are limited because we are tying our hands behind our backs.  I will admit I do it with my major alt that is in the CotL.  I attempt only enter into RP when it meets my criteria for what I believe is good RP.  However how many times have I missed good RP because I was not willing to sit in a bar and partake in a little inn RP?  We will never know because it is missed.  One of our Ogier friends, Dalar found away to hold of the Longing for 10 years while he traveled with the SeaFolk (Mind you Dalar was Jordan's character and not subject to an anal GL :P).
Now, I too have rambled on far to long.  Perhaps anyone who is intrested can sit down under a tree with me to chat about this and other ideas that float past us on the clouds.

      <author>0</author>
      <date>0</date>
      <text>Yes we all have good points but there are quiet a few people that come
to the Stedding and that we get along with really well (Tinkers,
Cairhien people, Aiel {hmm another idea}, ect...ect)
My idea to increase the rp a little is to have the treesing skill like
the instructing people skills so that to keep their minds active they
will need to do something while staying in the same room.
And if you really want to incourage rp have them turn in the logs for
it and the item that was sung...but that gets annoying.
As for the Innate subrank yes more subranks makes for more rp but 
1% is way to low...(looking at Loial again) Loial did not have anyone
to teach him the way and he has succeeded the only 2 times I remember 
reading that he used his gift (To get the Staff I dont remember where
and to the Green Man's final resting place tree to keep the blight
from consuming it)

The Idea I had when writing the Aiel was that we strike up a deal with
Velaseth and have us rp with Aiel to sing their spears...just need to
get it so we can hold onto them to sing them (even though the can't
break)

Just what I am thinking at the time.

I am new at this MGL thing and will be around most of the time so if
you need anything from authrizing to rank setting I can help otherwise
it goes to Amarinda.
One thing I have wanted this guidl to try to do is to do some active
recruting...Going out and talking to the newbies about us...I just
feel that they don't really look into guilds for their rp quality.
We are the Best Guild for friendly RP in the game. Well that is besides
the point just letting you guys know I am here...if needed mail me.

a response to carry out one of my plans...I was thinking about an 
rp event with the tinker but to get it going I feel that there should
be atleast 3 ogier in it to deem it worth it so put a post of mail me
if you would be interested and I will see if I could get some tinker
interested...I know there are a few that woud love to rp with us
and I think it would be a good idea.

to need a couple of sponsors.

      <text>Ok, im seeing this is not a lively guild *grin*, and the possiblities of 
advancement seem limited. So im thinking, as an advancement system for now,
(things may change but i feel you guys need some movement) is the submission
of 3 rplogs, with another Ogier, or myself or anyone, just an rplog, showing
you have skill, your good etc. Rplogs saying your good enough to move onto 
the next rank. So yes, for now thatis going to be your way of advancement,
if i think that your rplog could be better, i may ask you to do another.
So 3 really good rplogs for advancing to your next rank is how it is to be
for now. Im very open to comments on this, i hope that will be rather good
as its not a major change or going to mess anything up, its purely a way to
help you all move up and move on.

Next...I've been spoken to about ranks, im putting this out here for you all
to decide on...Do away with the ranks as they are now..And have ranks as an
Age or Honor system, so to speak..You would be a child,or an Ogier etc...
then you would have a subrank stating what porfession you have chosen and
how far into this profession you are...so it would look something like this on
the guild channel (rank) Ogier (subrank) [[Builder][Journeyman].
Ok so i want feed back on this, this is ment to be your desicion, but if you
dont take the time out to voice you opinion, i may just go ahead and do what i
feel is best.

Lastly....Idea's Idea's Idea's..If you have any please let me know, and we can
see what we can do..Rplogs for qp..And any and all ideas, for guild rp, or
rp with other guilds...
Thats it, i've exhausted myself for the day =P

      <text>Boy is my post late! Paige is already working her tired little tusy off
here I see. Likely you've already read the OOC board but if you haven't,
I would like to encourage you to do so to know what all this is about.

One huge change in this guild - no more DWGs. I can't claim to entirely
understand the reasoning of the mix and mingle here but no more. I know
that we'll be sad to lose a good portion of the guild, but let us not
forget that they are within their homeland in the Seanchan so they are
not being left without. If you are reading this and you are a DWG, please
see either myself, Paige, or Bowen immediately.

Paige is heading up the Home Lands grouping and that is why you now see
her smiling face all the time. Bowen is still the Guild Leader and will
remain as the guild leader but there is now an imm designated for doing
the things that Bowen cannot and here to take an active role in what is
going on.. or not going on as may be the case.

If you have any questions, feel free to talk to me.

      <text>Haran, I'd like to suggest something - if you have questions as to where
the leaders are, you might ask or do a personal mail. Not saying that
you haven't done the mail, but an open post on the board, well, that's
not the most productive way to see to things. For example, I know the
whereabouts of Paige. I could have helped with that. Also, she was here
just yesterday. If you have future questions, address them personally
or mail me.

      <text>Hey all sorry I have been on about as often as leppers get laid
(to put it mildly). The reason I have not been around at all is
because I have been job hunting for a while now and now that I have
finally gotten hired (first job and I start tomarrow) I should be
seen more and more as I get settled into it. So again I do appologize
(if it is spelled wrong sorry my spelling sucks).
Haran thanx I think I needed that &quot;slap&quot; to get me back into it
I had only been on to check the boards and hop off to get back to
what my parents were bugging me about. I will be sure to try to active
in both rp and recruiting so if any of you can convince a friend to
make an Ogier alt and send me a BG I will be sure to get to it quickly.

      <text>HEy all you Ogier out there I have gotten an idea that might help all
of you advance in rank and what not.
I am going to have a few NPC's that will be the equivalent of a
&quot;master&quot;...still working on what I should call them since master does
not sould right  along with Amarinda's suggestion (mostly that).
And as for the ability to rp with these NPC's I think I will be asking
the other MGL's and mabe even some of the IMMs to help if they are
willing and not to busy...if that does not work out I may have to have
you be the Npc for eachother...and if that does not happen I will keep
you updated with what is happening. I may just have the one and have to
make a schedule and have you request a day and time to rp with the NPC.
We will see what happeneds.And as always let me know what you think...
any ideas you might have on this and what you might do to improve it.
Bowen

P.S.
I felt it was necessary to to try and start somthing up because I feel
that a guild full of appretices does not attracked any new blood.

now about my last post I have Alani so ask her if she is on and not
busy if she will rp with you...Ogier style...and go easy on her she
does not know what to do when it comes to rp as an Ogier so when
you guys send in the log I will only really look at your emotes.
There is another imm that is going to help but I can't remember right
now so I will get back to you on that.
