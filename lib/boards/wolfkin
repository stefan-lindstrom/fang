      <text>I am wolf, I am as old as the mountains I call home. I have walked this earth long before human beings. 
I have seen mountains grow from small hills, form from small ravines and rivers born of trickling streams.
I have walked with the great ones of eons ago, the great mammoth, saber tooth tigers and many others who have long been lost. 
I have seen the beginning of mankind. 
I am wolf. I am predator. A hunter. I hunt for food. I do not collect trophies to be mounted on the walls of my den.
I do not hunt for enjoyment but out of necessity, for survival. 
I hunt to feed my children so they can one day walk upon mother earth and become of the circle of life. 
I am wolf. I am a loyal, devoted and loving parent. Our children are our future. 
I am protective of my children and I take my responsibility of their nuturing as seriously as any human parent. 
I provide food for my children and provide them with a safe home until they are ready to walk their own path. 
I am wolf. Wolves are beauty without vanity, innocence without naivete. 
We are one of the creators children and deserve to live our lives in peace. 
We were created for a purpose and it was not to be hunted and slaughtered. 
I am wolf. Tonight I will lay and sleep beside my mate and our children. 
This may be the last night we will share together upon mother earth for tomorrow 
many of our brothers and siters will be slaughtered and perhaps ourselves as well. 
Our songs will be only a distant memory, fading into the past. 

Unknown writer, but it's something I found... fitting.  Sorry for the sloppy format, and no, I take no credit for the writing here.  Just thought you all might want to see it.

      <text>Just another friendlt reminder of the &amp;Y30 Day Policy&amp;n. You will deguilded
if you are exceeding this time limit.This rule is set for a reason, and you
all entered into the guild knowing this.People who are being inactive are
taking place of people wanting into the guild and who will spend the time
active (or so i hope). If you dont have the time to spend on this guild
then i -dont- have the time to feel guilty for deguilding you.Unless you
have posted or mailed me that you will be inactive for a reason..
I WILL deguild you!!!!
So if you know someone who has been inactive yet plays another alt
frequently tell them,because time is running short.Currently 5 people
are up for deguilding,if you know them (even tho i'm not going to name
names)..they have a week from the time i send them a mail with a friendly 
reminder,reguardless of whether they receive the mail in the week..TOO BAD!!
If you feel im being harsh, well hey you all know the rules and im here
to inforce them otherwise whats the point of having this player cap.And this
in a sense is everyones last chance,i will make no more posts on the 
inactivity of players,and i will not mail anyone giving them a chance to 
log on within a week.So thats it..here and now, i shall no longer be
so lenient..It will be deguilding, no questions asked no more chances offered.
And that folks is my final word on that.Thanks..And if you think im being
unfair in anyway you know where to find me..Also the limit for bondable WK
has been changed.

      <text>Hi just a quick note, anyone wishing to have a retainer, please let
me know..there is a new policy on them..That you must have persmission from
your GL, and i have to write a policy.But the thing is being wolfkin, its
a tad hard having a retainer following you round cause it would scare the wolfs
off (to put it simply).So i want to know who wants one, why etc..so i can
work out some form of policy thats gonna fit with the guild.
Thankies

      <text>I apologize for my recent absense, and regret to inform you that it
will continue.  I lost my job, my house, and my car, and now I am
trying to get back on my feet.  I will be leaving for about 3 months,
meaning I will return mid to late March.  Please, hold on to me until
that time, for I do love the guild and all my brothers and sisters in
it.
I apologize again for my absence, and even moreso for my continued absence.

      <text>I though I'd say that I am usually available for RP any time between
17-23 Finnish time, which is quite much the morning in the US... Er,
anyway, 17 PM seems to be 9 machine time, if that helps someone :).
I'll be on earlier on weekends. If you have the time/will/whatever,
I'd be willing to RP somewhere in Caemlyn, or in the vicinity.

Vian

PS. I could RP with my alts, Irlan and Kedath, as well. The locations
I can RP in are mostly Baerlon, Salidar and Caemlyn.

      <text>Just to let you know, the player cap for WK has been dropped to 25 from 35.
If you really wish to know why, feel free to ask, cause i'm not gonna write,
it all up..
Also like i've said about activity, i will still be watching it like a hawk,
one day over and your out!.The reguilding policy still stands with a few
addons..
1. A probation period has been added..Rp logs will be required to prove you
are still interested in keeping your spot and proving your are active and
not just idling.
2. A seeker will take presidents over a person who has been deguilded, i think
the reason is obvious.
3. If you are deguilded for a second time, then tough!.That alt will no
longer be allowed to guild..-ever-.
If any of this sounds harsh or what not -shrug-.
So move along and have a good day, leave your presents at the door, i will
collect them later.

      <text>Yup, changes for you guys too. Will they ever end?

Since the immortals are becoming group leaders, there have been a few small
changes made around here. First, the Mort GL that you guys have had, Jerek,
will no longer be operating as the Guild Leader. Due to the changes, steady
activity is a concern and therefore, only Paige is left. That means two
things - we need a Mort GL for the guild and you'll need to go to Paige,
the Group Leader for the Home Lands guilds, which is where you fit. Even
after a Mort GL is placed, she won't be going anywhere. She will remain in
the guild and be as she always was (eating chippies and eyeing sheep).

If you want to apply, please mail me your app. Good luck!

      <text>I cleaned up the guild. You'll notice a few changes as in ranks and those
that went over the activity time limit. As well as that, I deguilded the
seekers that were not authorized or had not been on in 30 days. If you
talk to one of these seekers, please inform them of the time limit and
that during seeking, it's pretty important.

Most of the policies stay in place - such as those regarding the cap as
well as the time limit stuff.

If you have questions, please come to me.
