The current policy on the MUD is that in order to RP as having certain
weaves that are classified as RP weaves, you must have them in code. Some
of the more common weaves on this list are Gate, Heal Gentling/Stilling and
Invisibility. I would like to emphasize that this is NOT a Rebel Tower
policy but is a MUDwide policy. If you have the RP for such a weave but
have not yet bothered to learn it in code, you need to let me know so that
I can arrange for the codewise instruction. In most situations it probably
won't make any difference, but if you were to use a weave in RP that you
do not have the code to back up and someone protested to Council, you would
lose. Whether I agree with this policy or not, it is my job to enforce it.
If any of you have any questions about this, I always read my mail. Drop
me a line.

      <text>Well, it looks as if someone toppled over the ledge and took care
of the arguments over the bondcap. The earlier post has been removed
because it was disputed quite heavily.

&amp;gGreens&amp;n are allowed no more than four bonds. This includes bonds
that are active, inactive, and imaginary. &amp;RNO MORE&amp;n. The one chance
at having the extra is gone. You can hold no more than four up, back,
sideways, horizontally, it no longer matters.

&amp;BOther Ajahs&amp;n - See me if you have a problem.

This clears it up and is stated plainly, right? If the words 'No more
than four bonds' is not clear, then let's have a chat because I really
don't know how else to say it. There must be other issues if that
doesn't spell it out.

This is yet another example at how arguing, bickering, and senseless
carrying on only makes things worse for everyone else. Let's all learn
from it if that's possible.

Flame me in mails.  :)

      <text>This issue is currently posted in one of the old posts by a former GL,
but due to an overwhelming amount of confusion and such, I'm stating
it again as the rule still counts.

Aes Sedai are not allowed to learn any kind of combat weapons. When you
are brought here, you are to learn to be a lady. A lady. Ladies don't
go out back and wrestle, nor do they chop off heads with big pointy
sticks. That's why we put with and bond those warders - they protect
us when we need metal to metal or hand to hand protection only when
we can't channel for whatever reason. You are training (novices/accepted)
to wield the most powerful weapon that is known in this world. It is
not justified to learn a how to use a bow, a sword, staff, whatever it
is. If it's considered a weapon other than a small belt knife, then it
isn't your place. AS hardly have reason to wield a sword or weapon
because you use your head, your intelligence, your wit, your supreme
authority and the be all end all of abilities and weapons. Not only
that, but a lot of warders take it to insult because it is their job,
not ours, to hack someone to pieces with a blade. While you are deadly
in your own right, you deal with Queens, with Kings, with nobles, and
for that, you must be a lady - not a warder.

If you have issues or questions on this, feel free to send me a tell.
It's an old rule that still stands and needed to be reposted. It's also
on the warder board by a former GL known as Kirid. If the boys have
questions, point them in the direction of that long standing post or
to me. Thanks all.

      <heading>Wed Nov 14 (Amarinda)   :: &amp;RNew RT Channeling Policy&amp;n</heading>
      <slot>4</slot>
      <level>203</level>
      <author>0</author>
      <date>0</date>
      <text>Here we go, chickas. New policy. If there are questions or issues, mail
me with Mudmail or Email. It's effective as of -immediately-.

The following is in addition to the channeling policy currently in place by Cappen, posted on the OOC board for MUD wide reading.  The standards and rules set below are exclusively for the Rebel Tower and the Aes Sedai characters within it's guild list and those affiliated.

1.)   The strength of the characters will be in direct proportion to the flow cap of the character.  This does &amp;RNOT&amp;n mean that they are stronger if your spirit is 55 and theirs is 35.  It's an overall determination depending upon the maximum cap that the character receives in code.  The caps that are given, are set at numbers such as 211, 245, 270, and as you train up, you are the one that determines your individual flows. When you use the 'test' skill, it searches for the 211/245/270 cap of the other char and determines which of your caps are higher.  Use Test.  A lot.

2.)   If you have emoted differently up to the date of the channeling policy that has been posted, I will allow you to recreate to try for a cap in the neighborhood of what you have emoted, as long as it is reasonable.  If you've been emoting Super Sedai, I'm not going to help. But if you received the lowest cap possible but have emoted that you are decent with Saidar and not a complete weakling like your code char, then I will allow you this option.  It is however an option.  If you do not want to level up again for this purpose, then don't, but alter your emoting and who you defer to.

3.)   Since a woman's strength can be determined however young she is, novice or accepted level or before coming to the tower, I will now require you to cap your flows before obtaining the shawl.  It is hard to RP with other Aes Sedai, especially in a lot of 'almost' conflictual stuff, if you can't decide who is stronger.  In RJ's world, it was easy, I want it to be the same here.  I am altering the method of raising Aes Sedai, but for now, you must have capped before you can be raised.

4.)   From this date forward, those that join the guild and find they have a very low cap on their flows, may re-create &amp;RTWICE&amp;n.  I am not going to allow everyone to deguild and reguild four hundred times.  At creation, the flows that are assigned you are random.  You, nor I, have any control to what you receive. This is for fairness and realism that it is done this way.  You can hardly choose how powerful you want to be at birth or even if you have the ability.  Re-creation will also be handled by a set guideline.

5.)   If you desire to re-create, you MUST come to me to do this.  I will deguild you from the RAS and from the RT.  You should not have bonds to worry with if you must re-create before reaching Sedai, but for some reason, if you do, then I will handle this too.  However, you MUST deguild before deleting.  If you do not, you don't want to know what happens to the guild lists.  You will remain un-guilded until you level the char to 20. At that point, I will re-guild you into both, RAS and RT and your eq and skills will be returned at the set limits that are standard for your rank.  Since you are only allowed to re-create twice, I must be informed.  If you go to another IMM to do this, you &amp;RMUST&amp;n talk to me either in person on Fang or via Mudmails or emails.  I &amp;RWILL&amp;n keep track of the occurrences.

6.)   No longer will you be allowed to level up a separate character with another name for the purposes or re-creation. You MUST delete the current char and create another with the same name.  In the past we've not really cared one way or another but the holier Gods have spoken their mind and it will no longer be done.  We will not be using the set name command for you in any case, as it is hazy if it is wrong or right under current policies we have in place.  You delete, not set name.

      <date>0</date>
      <text>7.)   The slate is clean as of the date of this post.  You each have two re-creates you can do.  This is for those that have caps that are a little off from their emoting, or the younger chars that would like to try for a higher cap.  When you do delete and re-create, you will need to find a mort to hold your things for you.  You may not drop link to transfer, nor do I feel it is appropriate for an Immortal to do this for you. I urge you to keep in mind that when you re-create, you may not have a cap that is greater than the one you are unsatisfied with. If you go from a 250 to 150 by the end, it is random and will stick. There will be no more than two. This is for those that have not reached the shawl yet. Characters that are trying to match their emoting may discuss with me their caps and may not be hindered by the two recreates rule depending on circumstance.

8.)   I believe this is already stated, but there will be no out of guild teaching.  This includes teaching a DF gate or a WT AS gate.  It also means that you can't 'take someone under your wing' and teach them because they don't or can't join the guild.  The only people, chars, characters that you are allowed to teach or instruct, are those that have been guilded.

9.)   If you are a channeling female, you will be within the ranks of the other channies.  I will not put a channie as a warder nor will I allow the AS to learn weapons.

Notes:
If you need to recreate, let either myself or Celline know.  Celline can deguild you and mail me about you deleting and she can hold your things if you ask her nicely and call her 'Sweetie.'  She is the only one that is allowed to do this for any AS or AS trainees within the RT.

Do not forget that in the books, when one AS had to decide who was in control, it was how long she spent in the different ranks and strength. We have the test skill to let you know the strength, but there is no way to tell how long they spent in white.  Base it on test so that it is clear and defined.  Most situations it isn't really an issue, but it can become one within one emote.

Do not forget that if you flee from Salidar, if you were raised to the shawl here in the village, upon your return to the White Tower, you wear white regardless how strong you are.  They don't see us as AS because we've not held the oath rod not because we aren't that strong.

If and when you do something that affects Salidar as a whole entity,
or even affecting other chars RP or possibilities on RP, you need to
either make a post here, on the IC board, or at -least- pass the info
on to me so that I can make others aware. Communication seems to be
a huge problem, one that can be fixed. Let's work on it.

      <text>Public Service Announcement for RP and OOC information.

We have been looking at the Kin guild we have online and set up on Fang.
There are going to be some upcoming changes in regards to both the Rebel
Aes Sedai and the Kin, this being a merger of sorts.

From the books, the Kin that we have seen, that have helped Elayne and 
Nynaeve, made their presence known, are in Ebou Dar. The Kin we have here
have taken on different forms and currently have their guildzone in Caemlyn
instead of being stuck in Ebou Dar. Due to interest and the future, the
Kin are going to come in and be associated with the Tower. The Kin members
that are currently active will be swallowed into the Rebel Aes Sedai since
Aes Sedai would know about their presence. Or rather, all Aes Sedai. There
are not very many actives, but those that have been talked to expressed the
desire to be affiliated with the Rebels. Basically, we're going to add in
the Kin to the RT instead of leaving it at stand alone.

Now, this gives RP opportunities to you. You can RP with the Kin, you can
set them up as an Eyes and Ears, keep tabs on them, bring them in.. also
for the girls that come to the Tower, it would be easier for them to RP
out running and joining their ranks instead of becoming Aes Sedai.

The Kin member that runs the orphanage that is currently in Caemlyn is
going to be sent an invitation to come and meet with the Hall and her
name is Krisa. I will set up new ranks for those that are going to be
coming into us and you will be able to spot them. I will not be using
the protecterate rank, but instead, something along the lines of Rebel
Affiliate or something. But it gives you the chance to gain a little
RP of a different kind and allows more chances for different things 
within the guild.

If you have questions, specific questions about this, please talk
to either myself or Masema. Many upcoming changes it seems, and some
of them should be exciting. Good luck and have fun. :)

      <text>I have posted some new policies on the warder board that all Aes Sedai
should be aware of. First, the issue of warders having multiple guilds.

You are Aes Sedai and you bond who you wish to, meaning that it doesn't
always have to be within the guild. However, if you bond someone that
is in another guild, be aware that they will lose their status in the
guild they currently belong to. Before bonding someone, you should discuss
it quite extensively and make sure that the other player understands
what it means to bond to you. In other words, if you bond a Bandie, he
will no longer be a Bandie and will become a warder.

If you have bonded a warder and that warder wishes to seek the Heron
by actively participating in the tourneys that are held, he cannot do
that without talking to you and to both the GL of the Rebels and the
GL of the Blademaster's guild. He is your warder and should stay with
you at all times and work at your discretion. If the tourney is in
Caemlyn and you cannot go, then neither can he. It is encouraged that
they seek the heron before bonding, but if already bonded, then it is
required that they talk to you, and that both of you as a pair talk to
myself and Daene. Warders simply don't pursue their own goals while
bonded but if it is a goal that you share, then it is possible with
the GL's permission.

For that matter, if you're looking to bond someone outside the guild,
talk to me first.

If you have any questions, talk to me.

      <date>0</date>
      <text>I've noticed that at times, we need reminders of what we're here for. What we came in search of within Fang, within the Rebel Tower guild. We get into situations or environments that can cause us to lose sight of these things. I wanted to put together a post that offered you the chance to think on and reflect what you wanted out of your character. Things that should be thought about a little more than maybe we have done thus far.

What does being Aes Sedai mean to you and your character? How do you view these elite women? It was asked of Egwene in the books when she wanted to quit using the Oath Rod. What makes your character an Aes Sedai? It can't be the lone ability to channel. It's much, much more than that. Women that can channel range from Seafolk to Wise Ones, but they aren't Aes Sedai. They do not have a tower that causes kings and queens to bow before them. Seafolk don't stop wars, neither do Wise Ones (they simply don't participate). It isn't an ageless face or a golden ring that makes you an Aes Sedai. Do you see where I'm going with this? They are strong and wise, smart and envied, they are the embodiment of so much more than the ability to light a candle without a match. They have a name to uphold, a reputation, years of work. One person, one woman, can ruin the name Aes Sedai as casually as you sit in your cushioned chair tonight. Is that what we came to Fang for? The Rebel guild? No. We want to play women that are envied, that have power, that work for the Light and what is right or wrong depending on how they operate within their ajah.

Does this mean that you make yourself known wherever you go? That you over step boundaries that have been in place for years? Do you take an entourage of dogs into public places where you are seen as more than just a woman? To take it a step further, do you take your time to be sure that the RP is reflective upon what you are? If you thwap everyone with air anytime you walk around in Caemlyn, do you think that is properly portraying the position you hold? I am not calling anyone down for their style of roleplay or what they enjoy, but these are questions that should have answers, if not on paper, then in your mind.

Everyone has a different view on it, a different opinion, but one thing remains the same for any Aes Sedai. You are what you are and it affects not just you, but the Tower itself because you are a representation of that organization. People don't automatically respect you for a title, they respect you for your character and the character's ability, as well as your own. This is for fun, a play to socialize and roleplay, yes but that in no way means that you forsake all that is Aes Sedai. After all, that is our goal, right?

      <text>I had sincerely hoped that my post about what Aes Sedai means to you
would have been regarded seriously and have done it's part to improve
the little things, but to my disappointment, I see it's not the case.

I hate addressing this - both because I shouldn't have to and also
that it shouldn't be an issue. However, children are in the limelight
once again around these parts. I'm not going to bore you with book
references on the matter, although if you want, I will retrieve them.
Aes Sedai do not have children. Yes, it's been done before, but it
won't be again. Dictatorship? Yes. It's needed at times, it's what
I'm here for. If you choose to have your character, an AES SEDAI,
become pregnant, you will either remove yourself and retire from
being an Aes Sedai, or you will be removed by force. Sisters do not
have children. They seldom even marry, although, that I have let 
slide over the time I have been here. Perhaps I shouldn't? In some
cases, I would say no to that. In all cases, I say no to children.
Aes Sedai aren't housewives, especially those that are supposed to
be taking positions in the spotlight, in the world, working against
evil. It's simply not an option in this guild. If you wish to roleplay
out a family life, you shouldn't be what you are. Choose another
character. If you do these things, it better be private. Meaning the
marriage. You can't hide a child unless you retire, and you WILL
retire if you choose the family above the tower.

Understood? Good. Flames in mail.

      <text>As I am having a lot of people raised to the shawl, I wanted to take
a quick second to post on talents. I'm not sure what administration
is currently doing with them or the system right now, but we're all
going to act like it's still in place. 'help talent' will provide you
information on this system and you can pull up a list on those talents.
There are certain weaves that you can't learn unless you have one set
and I'd like to see some interest in this. However, just because you
want one doesn't mean you'll get it. Some are more for characters
that are not Aes Sedai in a Tower. Or rather, a Light loving Aes Sedai.
Some wouldn't be known to the general populace, either. I ask that
you consider these things before trying to obtain one. For those that
wish to get on, you need to mail me about it. What I want:

I want you to tell me what talent you want and why you want it. This
means your OOC reasons as you don't ICly decide you want to be good
at something. As for ICly, why would your character have this talent?
If you're a green and want the affinity for healing, chances are you're
not going to get it. There are a few different things to choose from
and you need to be realistic with your character. If it's something
that is not known or has not been rediscovered, you always have the
option of doing discovery roleplay for it. If you don't know what this
is, feel free to send me a tell. If you're applying for a talent, tell
me what you would do with it if you had it. I.E. if you only want it
to play with it OOC, you aren't getting it.

If you have questions, send me a tell.

      <text>Guildskills are currently being revised. For those that aren't aware,
each guild can have and maintain 9 skills. This does not include any
languages, grasp and release, or teach. Since the warders and Sedai
must share skills, they are split. I will list skills that are being
dropped and those that will stay.

Previously guild skills that need to be removed:
Mediate - Dropping. Formally ajah skill.
Meditation - Dropping. Exactly like Quick Mind.
Knowledge - Dropping. Exactly like appraise. Formally ajah skill.
Know Health - Dropping. Formally ajah skill.

Upcoming changes:
Test will be incorporated into the look and glance commands.

Skill list in total for Aes Sedai:
Grasp and Release - Do not count.
Test - Changing.
Teach - Does not count.
Languages - Do not count. Must be obtained IC'ly.
Stormshield
Thunderburst
Quick Mind - Mana regen
Sedaibond - Most like their warders, right?

If you have a skill that needs to be removed, please get in touch
with me. If you are fully ranked and need a skill, let me know.
Questions, comments, complaints, may be directed to me.

      <text> Rusty has the right of it. We now have the Rank Exchange program.

This means that if you're a Rebel Aes Sedai, you can create and play an
Aes Sedai within the White Tower. If you have a White Tower alt that is
an Aes Sedai and wish to play in the Rebels, you may also create and
play a Rebel. Same goes for those of lower ranks, as well. If you're a
novice on one side of the fence and would like to take part in the other,
that would work. I'd like to encourage Rebels to play within the White
Tower. As we know, the White Tower hasn't been as active as the Rebels
but it is fun on that side and we all need more controversy, right? ;)

The guide to creating a fully ranked alt in the other guild -
Same applies as it does for a normal background. However, you are
allowed to write the BG up to the current time. That means you can
write up her experience in white, banded white, her oath ceremony,
the trip through the arches, all of that. I'll need to know the typical
sorta stuff, but also maybe a little more detail. How long did you
spend in white? What were the fears you faced in the arches? What
drove you to the ajah you're choosing or possibly why you didn't go
with the Rebels (reversed for Towerites). Block? Anything unusual
happen over the years?

You don't have to write a book, but keep in mind you're passing a
few ranks. You can learn a lot by working in the other guild and
what you learn can enhance the roleplay with your current alt.

See me for more info or mail those BGs to me.  :)

      <text>As we all know, the raising of Sedai is a problem. It's mainly a problem
in Salidar. One that we should fix in a reasonable manner. Ok, here's the
problem...

Technically, Aes Sedai raised in Salidar aren't full AS because they did
not hold the oath rod. They pseudo-Sedai, for lack of a better term. Also,
with lack of the arches, we wouldn't be raising novices to the accepted
rank. Nothing has ever been put in that would be acceptable for a sub to
the arches.

-- Do we want to alter this system now that we are all one big group now?
-- Is there a way to do this so that long time players don't lose the
   status of their characters?

Help me out guys.. What do you want to do with this new fabulous OOC merge
with the towers? Anything? Nothing? Let me know.

for guilding. This means I'm being a little more strict on what
is authorized because you don't have the seeking process.

      <text>Ladies,

With the changes being made to the warder side of the guilds, 
it is time for a bit of adjustment on our part. The training that the 
guys are going through has had a focus switch, not simply being 
about emote combat anymore, but centering on what should be 
the most important thing for a possible bondmate. That thing 
would be the serving of Aes Sedai. They are nothing without you, 
never to achieve their dreams of being called a warder without 
the bond that you give them. This is why we need to adjust.

I'm encouraging all of you to get together with the guys, be it in 
a tavern for dinner or watching them in the training grounds for 
some role-play. Go out and look around, keep an eye out for a 
prospective bondmate, form relationships, but above all else 
remember that you are Aes Sedai and have responsibilities to 
uphold. Do not get drunk and act a fool, do not go screaming 
through the streets of Salidar or Tar Valon naked. Conduct yourselves 
as the well mannered women you are, women who deserve and  
earn respect.

As of right now, any RP logs that are submitted will be awarded 
with questpoints. Any logs that include multiple people of different 
genders and status within the guild will be awarded with additional 
questpoints. For extremely well done role-play, you may receive 
a few extra in addition to the ones gained for reasons above.

On a final note, although I am asking that you interact with the 
guys on more of a steady basis, please do not forget that we have 
aspiring Aes Sedai in our midst who do need two lessons per rank 
for advancement. Take the time to help them become what the 
rest of you already are. I would like to see all of you making the 
effort to help out, improving the relationships among your fellow 
guild members. Thank you.

More than just acting responsible in our own actions, we also have
the responsibility now of making sure those we choose to bond are
actually ready to be bonded. Many of us may not possess the ooc
knowledge of emote fighting and such to really make this
determination. This is not really a problem. That's what the
interaction is for. ICly and OOCly -ask- warders that you do
trust to give their opinions on the readiness of the trainees.

      <text>I've cleaned out the boards. If there's something that has been removed that 
you would like to see, mail it to me or repost it yourself. I found the things 
left to be important, though there are a few bits of information that I'm 
going to go over again.

Firstly, if you're going to be involved in strange and unusual things, let Fayth
and myself know. We're here for a reason, that reason being to make things as 
fun and pleasant for everyone involved as possible. When approached about a 
certain roleplay or plot, we can better keep you out of trouble if we've heard 
about what's planned before it happens. Not in the middle, not after, but 
-before-. If you get our permission for things that may not be covered by
policy, it's our asses on the line, not yours.

Rooms for you guys are available if you want them. There is a limit of one per
Aes Sedai alt. Mail me the room name and description and it will be put in as
soon as possible.

Lesson notification should also be mailed to both Fayth and myself. By mailing
the both of us, it's more likely that the information isn't going to be lost 
accidentally or something. Both of us have that mail as a record of who has been
given what lesson, so it won't be forgotten.

Um, I think that's it. I'll leave you with a final note. Recruit long, recruit 
hard, just recruit. Bring in fresh blood, not only to the guild, but to the mud.
It's a good thing. Trust me on this one.

Questions, comments, flames? Mail me.

      <text>I forgot to mention in my last post that all things that Amarinda or Cappen
may have posted that remain on the boards still apply. Simply replace their
names with my own, and don't forget to keep Fayth informed as well. She's here
to help. Lets use her, mmkay?

      <text>Hello ladies :)
Just a quick message to some of you who seem to be a bit concerned:
If you feel as though you have waited an inordinate amount of time
and have still been unsuccessful in finding someone willing to give
you the lessons you need to advance in rank, please let me know, and
I will see what I can do to help.
The same holds true if you've already received all your lessons, and
are simply waiting for me to test you! Please, please, please, don't
hesitate to let me know, and I'll -make- time for you :)
That is all :)
Fayth
