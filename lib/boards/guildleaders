      <text>I'm guessing that you guys have seen my post on the imm board by now so
I'm going to skip all the introductory stuff for now. If you have any
questions at all, please please please come to me. We can't work anything
out if you don't speak up and we all have opinions - however hard we try
to bite them back.

Now, the quiz. It's not necessarily a quiz, but we've all been here long
enough to know what should and shouldn't be done as well as how to work
with people that aren't level 203 - and you need to. I want to be dead
sure that everyone that is GL of a guild knows about this little thing
called policy. Also, something that you need to read if you haven't for
some odd reason - handbook. Yes, we all come here to have fun and I want
you guys to have as much fun as everyone else but the point is, you've
hired on to do a job and I'm going to expect it done. I don't think that's
unreasonable. I know some will and that's, well, it's sad.

I expect you all to put in decent time and energy into your guild and work
with your guildies. If something is bothering you, come to me. Chances are
I'm going to listen and understand where you're coming from. Try me. If
you're having a bad day and don't want to spend an hour on a help file then
by all means, log on a mort and roleplay, level, do what you want to do.
It's much better for you to log off your imm if you're not wanting to handle
issues than to sit around and idle watching the screen scroll with tells
because you can't be bothered. I'm not saying that in order to have fun with
an alt that you have to log off your imm, but if you leave your imm on, then
answer those tells, listen to your channels, be responsive. I feel the need
to say again - don't neglect the guild but take time out to have a little
fun. However, if you've done nothing productive for two weeks or it takes
you that long to respond to mails - it might be a little more difficult to
keep a spotlight position.

I will be talking to all of you as the chances come available. Don't wait
for it though, come to me if you want something. If I don't respond within
a day of a mail, send me a tell. If you need things done then make me do
them. If you are having a helluva arguement with someone let me know so
I can be there and try to help with it.

So, like I said, not much of a quiz but everyone needs to be familiar with
the basics again because it's expected. Not much more of a chance to sit
around and do nothing or abuse powers. Anyone noticed the lack of faith
in the immortals? Even those that have been working their arses off? Think
we should fix that? I damn sure do.

      <text>New way of doing things!

This room is now for guildleaders. That implies both mortal and immortal
peeps. This board is for the discussion of guild matters, a way for the
morts to come to the imms, a place to hang out and discuss stuff that
needs to be discussed, so on.

If you need something, if you have something to say, say it here. This is
our little get away to be guildleaders and not public relations people.
I guess the nitty gritty BS or some such, right?

      <text>I've said a million times not to use the gequipsend command. Please,
listen to me. It works or appears to at first, but it deguilds most
everyone in the guild. You will have to give guild eq while the person
is online and not send it to them for this reason. This post stays put
until a coder has informed me personally that it has been corrected so
if you see it, assume it's valid.

      <text>Please don't forget that backgrounds including other guilds than your own
needs the approval of that guildleader.  If someone says they are from the
Two Rivers (now Manetheren under Nations) then you need to discuss it with
Paige.  If you receive a background that they are a runaway from the White
Tower, you need to see Alani.  Do make sure that all the involved
guildleaders are on the same page with this.  It's quite important for
many reasons.

      <text>Hm. Changes made and we're all still alive. Damn skippy!

A few thoughts now that most of the tedious stuff is complete. First, you
have all done a great deal to make this work and I do hope that continues.
We have bumps in the road but at least it wasn't trees. You've all offered
a great deal of feedback and that is important. It's now your turn to get
out and about and get feedback for yourself.

As you know, I'm altering the job description. However, after thinking on
this for two days, I've discovered something. We each define our jobs in
our own way and bring something unique to it. I'm going to describe a bit
of what I want or what I would like to see and then we'll discuss what it
is that you are actually doing. Everyone will be doing things their way
and I think a mix and match is important. I know the morts get a different
answer from each of us when asked about what's going on. Let's see what
happens next.

I'd like to say that most changes are complete and it's time to start a
new path. That being getting out with the mortals and being players
-with- them. We are players. We have a high level to help them. While
there are a few perks, that's what it boils down to. Yeah, I'll quit
saying this eventually, but I think it's a hot topic right now. I am
going to start looking for you out with the population and working. If
you have quest ideas, post them on the quest board. Or just ideas in
general.

Mortal Guild Leaders:
If you have questions about what you need to be doing, talk with the imm
in charge of the group or myself. You are responsible for the majority of
stuff now.

      <text>Just a note - the Shadow is a guild, too. We go to the other GLs
when receiving a background with Two Rivers, nobility, Aes Sedai,
etc.. but we don't Shadow? Let's change this. If someone wants a
background approved with Fades, Trollocs, death and mass murder,
forward it to Tabi so she can work out the evilness -if- it has
to be included. Note: Normal people are fun to play. Encourage
that perhaps?

      <text>I need to stress -again- that you need to be sure that you are working
together. If something unusual comes up, be sure to talk to the other
people responsible for the guild. It's sorta the same thing as going to
another guild leader when someone includes that guild in their background.
If only one party of four is aware of what's going on, there will be a few
problems to occur. It's like, better than a new car guarantee. Not only
that, but it covers your ass, too. *winknudge*

I've noticed a trend recently (or actually, noticed it cropping up again)
where if a seeker is trying to get something ludicrous approved and is
told no, they just smile and nod and go down the line and ask the next
person who might be able to approve their BG. Of course, the never mention
that they've already been turned down. This further supports what Amarinda
says about us having to work together. Also, I'm personally in favor of
upping the ante in terms of strict judging of BGs for anyone who tries this
stunt. There are a lot of iffy things we let slide through on a BG, but if
someone tries the ridiculous and is told no and tries to get someone else
to approve it instead, we should disallow anything even remotely grayish
in any BG they ever propose from that moment on. IMO.

      <text>This situation is in the limelight again. I'm not sure if everyone
realizes this or not, but if you tell someone no, they are going to
go to someone else right away. If it's something that you do feel
somewhat strongly about, send a mudmail to the other person that
works with you so they are aware ahead of time.

Lately, I've seen a great deal of tricks used. It's even been reported
that when a mort was told to see his GL, he asked if he could talk to
someone that was completely unrelated. Why would he do this? Because
the player felt -confident- that this person would say yes regardless
of the position he/she held. If you easily say yes to most offers or
issues that come your way, take a few moments to think on the people
that most often come to you and their history. Sometimes the problem
kids are easily identified.

And remember, if you don't know or you're uncomfortable with something,
there are a lot of avenues to take as far as questions or help goes.

      <text>I've been officially requested (read: banned) to not mud from work except
during lunch.  Which means for a little while, you'll be seeing a lot
less of me.  *flat stare*  I'll be on during lunch for the pithy 30-45
minutes that I can steal from them, at approx. 12pm machine time.  Any
and all requests made on me will be taken care of during this time.
I, of course, will continue to log in from home in the evenings, but I
know this means a lot of you (read: swedes/dutch/europeans) won't be
able to actually see me unless you're on during lunch.  I apologize 
greatly for this.  I'm seriously pissed off.  If you'd like to know why
I'm so pissed off about this 'decree' of theirs, do feel free to ask.

So here's my new hours:
Mon, Tues, Thurs: 12-12:45pm, 7-9:15pm
Wed: 12-12:45pm, 9-9:30pm
Fri: Varies, typically will be 11am-6pm, 7pm-11pm unless I'm going away
Sat: varies.  anytime between 11am and 11pm
Sun: 8ish-9:30ish pm
All times are in machine time.

      <text>After reinstalling my client, it made me think about something. The guilds
that use &amp;&amp;k for the color probably need to change that. The majority of
people cannot see the dark black color so if you use it for ranks, it's
going to annoy the piss outta them and they won't know what it says unless
they quietly go to the effort of copy/paste into something else. If you're
not sure what I mean, configure your background to black and then the &amp;&amp;k
to the same color. Let's try and change it to the lighter gray black or
the &amp;&amp;K that we use?

      <authorname>Amarinda</authorname>
      <text>It seems activity has dwindled down to very little and in times like this,
there's always the question of what to do about those in our ranks that
never show up.

The answer is not to deguild them. If you feel that you simply have to do
something with the inactive players, then tag them as inactive. There is
a reason that the guilded pfiles are deleted after a longer amount of time
than the unguilded. And likely, it's just going to create more work for
you in the end. They log in, have to have their character revived, then
they want to be reguilded. You have to look around for whatever rank they
had or take them at their word, and all the stuff that goes with that.

That said, I don't want inactives deguilded. Leave them there. Mark them
how you want, but it's pointless to deguild them and have them deleted.
It's simply a bad idea all the way around.

      <text>Let me try this again.

Our playerbase has been low and slow this summer. That is not a reason
to slack off on work and such. If anything, it's the best time to get
stuff done because you don't have someone nagging you for something
constantly. It's -our- job to get people here and active and interested.
Think you can do your part? Go IC and get roleplay started, do a quest,
do behind the scenes stuff, but do -something-. If you don't want to do
anything and you want to stand around, quit being an immortal. If you
don't want to handle requests and get people interested in your guild,
give up the position so that someone else can try. This whole apathetic
approach to stuff that I'm seeing is about to result in a lot of hurt
feelings because it's time to get over it. If you literally have nothing
to do, see one of the department heads because there are a lot of things
that could and should be resolved. There -is- work enough to go around.

enforcing the following policy: Immortals, you should be on a minumum of
15 hours a week, and Mortal GLs should be on a minimum of 10, unless there
are special circumstances, which you discuss with me.  I may be a bit more
lenient with MortGLs, but you Immortals, you really need to put the time

I've been noticing on syslog that a lot of newly guilded people don't
know about the ghelp system. They try to get help on things like guild
skills or guild equipment and spam the nohelp syslog. It might not be a
bad idea for someone to inform them about ghelp and instruct them in its
use as part of the guilding process.

      <text>In case you haven't noticed, there have been some changes made with the
immortals.  Before, they were told to define their own jobs.  Well, now
I'M defining them.  

ImmGLs will have the same responsibilities and authority as MortGLs once
more.  This includes things like handling seekers, aka approving
applications and/or helping to make the application workable, guilding,
explaining things, like promoting people, reviewing RP logs, settling
disputes, etc.  This isn't rocket science; most of this is obvious.  You
will be working as a team with your MortGL, assuming the guild has one, so
though you should be keeping them in the loop and getting their input,
both you and they should be doing things like scheduling guild RP, guild
activies, et cetra.  Major things like rewriting syllabi/ranking systems
should be done WITH the MortGL.  I EXPECT to see you doing these things.

Any questions, complaints, comments, direct'em my way.

      <text>That's right.  The sponsor code has been fixed, and is usable again.  
Many thanks to Cappen for this.  Not only is it usable, but I expect you
all to be using it.  No more mailing sponsorships in, no more guilding
without sponsors, and especially, no more guilding without the person(s)
even seeking.  The point of sponsoring is to introduce the seeking
character to the IC world, so this is especially vital with newbies.    

This means: you're going to have to take a more active role in your guild.
Before any of this, you need to check your seeking list, and deguild
anyone who's stopped playing.  Anyone who hasn't, you need to help them
find some RP.  If you can't find any guild members, then you'll have to do
the RP with them yourself.  I promise you, this won't kill you.  =p

As usual, direct any comments or complaints to me.
