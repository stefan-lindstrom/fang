      <text>Those of you who have checked out the web based versions of the syllabus
may have noticed Joe the Asha'man who is used in all the sample emotes. He
is rather a boring little chap. That's where you come in. I'd like emotes
from actual RP to put in for those examples. So, if you have a good one,
mudmail it to me. I'll make the necessary changes and award the points.
Now, some of you may be thinking that I have no way of knowing if it was
actually used in RP or if you just made it up for the QP.. You're right. I
don't have any way of telling. What I think I mean is that I'd love for
them to be from actual RP, but that they don't have to be. But Joe has 
GOT to go. So send in those sample emotes and collect those QP. Target
ain't cheap.

I would like to encourage you all to use the Discovery policy for learning
new things or rediscovering lost talents. There is pretty good precedent
for this in the books with Canler discovering how to bond and Damer making
great strides in the area of Healing. Some things, such as the Healing, 
will require and inborn affinity for such things. Others, like perhaps
firesword, would just require study. If you would like to become involved
in such things you need to apply. For discovering things, you need to
write up the proposal first and mail it to me. If I have no problems with
it, I pass it on to Valkeria for approval. If both of us give the go ahead,
then you begin the discovery RP. This takes a minimum of four weeks of RP
which needs to be logged. At the end of that time period, the CRE will
review the RP and determine if there was success or failure, whether you
need more time or if it is just hopeless or whatnot. If what you want is
something that does not require study, but is simply an inborn ability
such as affinity for healing or the ability to read residues, you simply
apply to me. Write a fairly thorough explanation of how you would RP the
ability and what you would plan to do with it and such as that. Some of
these are rather simply things which only require my approval. Others, such
as ter'angreal or angreal creation, would require CRE approval as well plus
discovery RP to learn how to use them. In any event a simply mail of one
sentence along the lines of &quot;Me want balefire.&quot; is not going to result in
approval.

If there are any questions, y'all know my mudmail address.

If you are on the farm doing non-lesson RP and would like to be rewarded,
message me through tells or on the guild channel. I am generally willing
to watch the RP and award quest points. If I am not around, or if I am
busy with something else, you may also log the RP and send me a -cleaned-
log at kaith@cubsmvp.com. This goes for any RP, really, but in order to
encourage (not force) on-farm RP, the points awarded will be slightly
higher for on-farm. If you cannot log, or would prefer not to, you may
send me a brief synopsis of the RP. This will not generally result in as
many points, but will still garner some rewards.. in addition to the 
fun of the RP, that is.

In order to encourage training, I am starting an incentive program. If you
give one of the required lessons and send me the log, I'll give you a QP.
You will get an additional 1 to 4 QP for it depending on the quality of the
lesson. If it is an optional lesson, these awards will be -doubled-.
HOWEVER, if you receive the minimum award (i.e. give a very low quality
lesson) you may have to retest before you will be allowed to continue
giving lessons.

Very soon I am going to do away with the Fully Trained subrank and turn it
into an Instructor subrank. This will not be an elite position, it will be
a work position. The teach gskill will be moved to the Trained subrank and
Instructor subrank will be given gskillset. Furthermore, anyone who is of
the Trained subrank can apply to me to become a recruiter. This will also
be noted in your subrank. These people will be given guilding permission and
some responsibility in helping people with their applications. If you have
any questions or suggestions, you all know how to reach me.

&amp;fNEW GUILD POLICY&amp;n

Since we -do- have the most powerful gskills on the MUD, we will be making
a slight change in the laughable name of balance. If you are guilded in
secondary guilds, you must choose between having BT gskills or those of
the secondary guild. The only exception will be those skills that do not
count against gskill totals such as language skills (codetalk, trolloc,
old tongue, etc). If these seems unfair, grab a chunk of perspective.
Rolling Ring is the only weave that does not have a damage cap of it's own.
Only the fight code's cap of 20000 affects it. This is oh.. 2.5 times the
max that thunderburst can do. It is going to be hard to convince me that I
am being unfair by not letting you add something like wardercombat into
that mix. If you want to say &quot;but wouldn't you ICly know these other skills?&quot;
I'm going to respond loudly that GSKILLS ARE NOT IC!

Thank you,

Mgmt

      <text>mail Amarinda with lots of spam about how much you hate me, I am not
changing policies and suchlike at this time.  That might leave some of you
wondering why the title of this post is &quot;Policies and Things&quot;.  It's
either because I want to mystify you, or because I'm announcing a
breakthrough in guildleader technology called, &quot;listening to what people
say&quot;.  That's right, I'm going to listen to what you say.  No, really...
I am.

What you need to do is go south two and write on the board there
what you'd like to see changed.  Policy, syllabus, guildeq, gskills, the
guildzone, ranks, ranking system, etc.  I want to know every little thing
you like, dislike, or have no preference to with respect to this guild.  
If you really felt like getting on my good side, you could even suggest
ways to improve it.  Also, you will note that the board in question is the
&quot;Black tower &amp;Rdiscussion&amp;n board&quot; (emphasis mine).  So if you want to respond
to what another has written, feel free.

N.B.  The Black Tower currently has six assigned gskills out of a max of nine.  The chances of you convincing me that the Asha'man need another guildskill are approximately pi divided by zero, but bondeds and such might be able to get a few skills thrown their way.

      <text>   That's right guys, new syllabus.  Obviously, it's listed under ghelp 8
syllabus, and the new ranks will be implimented on April 12th.  For anyone
who wants to slip in one more quick test under the old syllabus, which is
still posted under ghelp 8 oldsyllabus for this purpose, as well as
reference, you have until then to do so.  If you want to be convered right
away, that's fine too, just see me or Tiekith, my immortal lacky.  Feel
free to post comments and opinions on the new syllabus on the discussion
board, and anyone who comes up with better subrank names then Junior and
Senior that I choose to use'll get a couple QPs.  =P
That's all for now, folks.

      <text>This covers a few topics, but I'll keep it brief:
1)  There is now an updated syllabus object.  In order
to get one, you can pick one up at recall 8;n;n;e, or 
bug me or Tiekith.
2) As there's a syllabus obj, I'm taking both the new and
old syllabus out of the ghelp.  It's going to be pruned.
Short, I say! Short!
3) Recruiters.  There's now a ghelp 8 recruiters.  That
covers the requirements, etc, to become a recruiter.  
Recruiters are the spiffy people who have guild permission
and help out seekers or new members.  I'll think up some
incentive to become one later, but there will probably
be rewards for doing a good job at this.
Oh, and you.  Yes, you.  RP.  That's not a request, it's
an order.  =P  I'd like to see activity.  Come on, guys.
You finally have a chance for IC advancement, and to get
some RP going.  Carpe diem!  Plus, you get questpoints.
Double bonus.  Take advantage of it.
That's all for now...I'll think up something else to bother
everyone about later, probably.

      <text>I've always seen this subrank/title as a bad idea.  There are people (such as myself) who aren't on as much as GLs like, so they lose the Recruiter title (as I did).  This does not detract from the RPability I have.  All this does is discourage me from doing such RP during the times when I am on.  Just a thought.

      <text>Well, first, the reason most people who had the subrank lost
it was due to their rank.  You must be at least Dedicated[Junior]
to be a recruiter.  As to activity, that can be discussed, and if you
choose to not do RP when you /are/ on simply because you don't
have a Recruiter title, well, that's up to you.  Any RP, seeker
included, is rewarded with QPs if submitted, and counted towards
rank advancement, so I don't see where the discouraging is.

      <text>Hey guys, I'll try to keep this brief...
Basically, if you're planning on doing, or have done, some RP that could
be considered controversial, important, or just something common sense
says the GL should know about, please do indeed let me know about it.  
I'm here for you guys, and I don't really care if the other GLs don't like
something you've done, but if I only learn about it when another GL, or
Immortal, or player complains to me, not only will I be less able to
defend you, I'll also be less inclined to do so.  So please, make sure you
guys cover your asses and let me know.

      <text>The previous policy concerning recruiters has been repealed.  It was silly 
and arbitrary.  Whoever wrote that policy deserves a sound beating.  Try to 
be gentle...I bruise easily.  The new policy is as follows:

There is no more Recruiter tag.  Instead, you will simply be given guilding 
permissions.  If you have guilding permissions, you can do seeker RP.  If 
you do not have guilding permissions, you need to obtain permission from 
the GL in order to do seeker RP.  If you want guilding permissions, see 
Jephrey or myself, and we'll give you a three minute interview.  There is 
no rank requirement, and there is no activity requirement.

Questions regarding this new policy should be directed wherever you want to 
direct them, but they probably won't do any good unless you post them here 
or use mudmail or something.

      <text>   That's right...  An RP oppertunity!  We all know that news of the
seanchan invasion of Ebou Dari is making it's way about ICLy.  Well, our
good old leader Mazrim has decided to send a patrol to investigate the
city...  And this includes you!  This'll only happen if I get a large
enough response, but it should be fun.  I've talked to the Seanchan
guildleader, and we can potentially grab some of their patrols, a Blood or
two, etc.  It should also be a chance to possibly catch Mazzie's eye, for
you Dedicated out there.  I'll accept anyone from Soldier[Junior] rank and
up.  If this turns out well, I might also count it doubke towards whatever
RP log requirement you have for your rank..  Aka, 2 logs instead of one.
Anyway, if you're interested, mudmail me with the times you're
available to RP.  I'll wait about a week or two for everyone who
is interested to get in touch with me.

Of course we would need the approval of the Lord Dragon or Mazrim Taim before any action, but perhaps a scouting patrol could be dispatched or something like that

      <text>Alex, if I can call you that, I'd be up for some rp if you catch
me online. Anyone else would be welcome to join. Mudmail me if you have some
interest, I belevie I have enough authority to take out a small patrol.
