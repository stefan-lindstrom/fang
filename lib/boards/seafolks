      <text>Hey, if you'd like some Seafolk RP, just send Esbjorn a tell when you
him on and ask if he can log on his SF.  This is one of my characters
that I'm probably not going to log on much unless his presence is
requested, but he -is- there to be utilized.

      <text>Couple things, that likely should have been mentioned before but haven't, 
given the inactivity of the guild.

&amp;W1)&amp;n You've got new GLs.  Alani and myself are now (and have been for about a 
month) the Group Leaders of the Sea Folk.  Alani's in charge of all things
channie (Windfinders) and I've got everything else, but feel free to come
to either one of us if you need anything.

&amp;W2)&amp;n I've cleaned the board.  Not that there was much here anyway, but it has
been cleaned.

&amp;W3)&amp;n If you're alive, please send either myself or Alani a short little mail to
say &quot;Hey, look, I'm alive!&quot;

That's it, that's all.  Let's see some life!

      <text>Hey folks,
As of this past Monday, I resigned from the position of Foreign Lands Imm.
I'll be staying here as the Mortal GL of Seanchan, but will no longer be
in any form of charge over SF.  You'll be receiving a new Foreign Lands
Imm within the next couple of days.  Until then, please direct all needs
to Alani.

      <text>Well, it's been a long time coming, but yea, this guild has finally been
closed.  It won't be deleted, but for the forseeable future, it will be
closed to new applicants.    
Direct any comments, complaints, whatever, my way.

      <text>As of right now, I am the Temp GL here. If any of you actually live and need 
something, don't hesitate to contact me in any way listed in my contactinfo 
or on the mud to tell me about it.
