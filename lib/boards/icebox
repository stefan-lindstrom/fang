      <text>Yes this board is getting usage again.  The reason they're iced is because
they were disruptive during a quest I ran and when I told them to quit,
and then talked to them later, they felt that I could go blow off, basically.
So they get to sit there for a while until they feel like they can be
more civil when I tell them that things like Bosom Power are a bit
uncalled for during a quest, non char affecting having no affect on that
limit regardless.

      <text>I do think I know why I'm sitting here, but not how long 
that will be. Perhaps forever. It must have been yesterday, 
when I told Michiru I was going to kill him IRL. Excuse 
me but I need to laugh. BWAHAHAHAHA! Well, I shall sit 
here until my punishment is over, or until I die IRL. 
I must say that it's a good thing to have this board 
here, so that everyone in here can write their own 
message and leave it for others to see(if anyone ever 
comes here, that is). First of all, I'd like to thank 
those who built this room, for making it totally in 
ice. That almost makes me feel at home. I'll stop 
writing now, since I don't have anything more to say. 
Except maybe that you could have said anything first 
instead of just putting me in here without a word. 
That way, you are no better then me...

      <text>I'm the player of Tenebrius and I just wanted you to know that the laugh on my latest message is not to be taken as an insult against the person I threatened. It was merely a psychic breakdown. My nerves collapsed and I just had to get it out. Don't ask me why I wrote it down, becuase I don't know. I think the only one that knows what's in my twisted mind, is the psychologist I've been seeing and probably not him either.(Don't take this as a joke, because it isn't).

      <text>my fellow mudders. i can appreciate the need to have some rules 
and regulations on a mud. But i do not agree with over 
sensitive rules and regulations. I don't believe it is right 
to make rules that cater to the minority rather than the 
majority. If one person doesn't  like a rule, it doesn' get 
changed. if several people (51% or more) don't like the rule, 
it is usually considered. Such is the way things happen. but 
when people become too paranoid about what is right and what 
is wrong, stupid things start to happen. I will say that in my 
experience most mudders are mid- to late teenagers and older. 
the things i said that got me put in here are nothing worse 
than what you'd hear on a sitcom on network television. even 
those owned be isney.  in a world where brief NUDITY and mild 
profanity constitutes PG-13, then expcting people to always 
use &quot;proper&quot; language is an absolute joke.  When i first 
started playing this mud, people could express their opinions 
anyway they wanted to, within reason, and it sometimes led to 
some interesting debates and conversations, and sometimes to 
some good RP.  Then their was a Great Restructuring, lots of 
new &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;policies&quot; added and it detracted from the 
creativity of the Rp. instead of looking at the positive side 
of things and encouraging that side, they tried to rid 
themselves of what they thought was the &quot;bad&quot; side.  Well i'm 
going to let you know that if you downgrade the bad the same 
happens to the good. they will always be in balance.  Now a 
lot has changed since i played this mud almost religously, the 
Rp is much fewer and further between, and what i see isn't as 
in-depth and as creative and fun, yes FUN.  everyone is so 
worried about stepping on someone elses toes that they don't 
take a risk and try to offend someone, not all RPs have to 
start with a smile and a handshake, and lets face it, its not 
that fun.  And I can remember when people got creative it 
didn't always fit in with the books, but lets remember not 
everything we do in Rp has to done already in the books ;(unless their is a policy about that now too). Well, we'd try 
to accomodate those people as much as possible and it usually 
made for some interesting RP.  Now it seems as though everyone 
is afraid to really push the limits, i know newbies will do 
it, because they may not know any better, but those that have 
been here for a while settle with what they've grown 
comfortable with and don't try to branch out like they did not 
so many months ago (13 months to be more precise).  This is 
still one of the better muds out there, and i have no desire 
to stop playing it, but as a quick example i read a note on a 
board that said Lethan had quit &quot;you've won, i no longer want ;to play&quot; it said (or something really close). I remember 
people gave him a hard time for being a DF whitecloak. well 
eventually you badgered him enough to snuff out his desire to 
play this game. pat yourselves on the back if you were 
involved in that one (sarcasm by the way). I guess i'll wind 
it down by saying that you shouldn't be so sensitive, relax 
and have fun, and above all else remember it -IS- a game.

Swing looooow, sweet chariot.... come'n for to carry me hooooooome!

Every town.... has got it's ups and downs... sometimes the ups...
outnumber the downs.... but not in Nottingham...

Yup, here I am, in the icebox... what am I in here for, you ask?
Well, it most certainly be MS related, that's for sure... or
maybe it's for having cute hair? I dunno, either way I plead
guilty. :D
