      <text>What follows is a copy of the DL syllabus. This provides
a large framework for what will be taught. I need to
flesh out the weave descriptions, but I plan on making
this into an actual item rather than a post. I just 
wanted to let you know the plan ASAP.

Rules and Regulations
1. Always obey your superiors direct orders (or give
the appearance that you are) unless you want to deal
with the consequences. It is strongly suggested that
you bow if a superior enters the room. The degree of
the bow depends on how high the superior stands in
the chain of command.
2. Do not leave the camp unless you have the rank of
at least Dreadlord Initiate. You are not permitted to
take anyone of a rank lower than that from the camp. 
If you do so and are caught, you will be punished
severely.
3. Recruits are expected to report daily for kitchen
duty as well as cleaning duty in the trolloc pens.
4. The Master Dreadlord's word is law, allowing him/her
to circumvent any rule he/she wishes, or adding as he/she
sees fit. High Dreadlords are also law unto themselves,
but to a lesser degree. Everyone, however, is accountable
to the Dark One himself.
5. Do -NOT- attract notice to yourself or advertise your
true abilities. You are left to your own discretion on 
this matter but know that if you are found to be failing
in your duties or otherwise are displeasing, you will be
dealt with.

Knowledge
1. Trolloc is the preferred language when ordering about
Shadowspawn. That, in addition to a sick displeasure I
derive from it, is the reason why you have to clean those
foul creatures' pens. You'll quickly learn the difference
between 'eat human' and 'too full'.

Recruit
This is the rank at which you will gain almost all of your
formalized training to be a dreadlord. If you have had
emote channeling experience in another guild, be it RT, BT, 
or WT, then you can apply to move forward to Dreadlord
Initiate. The process is simple. I want logs, and lots of them, 
that express to me that you know how to emote channel well.
If you can please me you will pass onto Initiate. If not, you
get to take the lessons. By the way, I want logs of the 
lessons as well. Lessons without logs don't count.

Rules for Recruits
1. No grasping without supervision or permission.
2. No experimenting with weaves until you achieve the rank
of Dreadlord. This means only weave what you are being 
told/taught to weave. To do otherwise is to be punished.

Lessons to be learned OOCly by self-study
1. The use of cemote. The help file can help you with this.
I'd like three examples written up for me and included in 
with one of your lesson logs.
2. The names and purposes of all 5 Powers. There are 
countless resources online as well as through your own 
knowledge on the subject. Explain them to me in a few
sentances each. Also to be included in one of your lesson
logs.
3. The differences between saidar and saidin. &quot;One for the 
woman and one for the man&quot; is not going to be enough, but still
limit your answers to a few sentances. Again, include in one
of the lesson logs.

Lessons to be learned OOCly with a teacher
1. The flame and the void or the flower.
2. Grasping/Releasing
3. The dangers of fatigue while channeling as well as the
dangers of drawing to much Power to you. (burning out)
4. The idea, if not necessarily the action, of linking.

Lessons to be learned ICly with a teacher
1. Wards
2. Fireball/Lightning/Explosion
3. Shield
4. Breakshield
5. Wall of air
6. Club or air
7. Simple healing
8. Wrap
9. Gag
10. Travelling

Travelling is to be the last weave you learn before being 
promoted to Dreadlord Initiate. The others are to be taught
as a bare minimum of what you will need to learn as soon as 
you go out into the world. Remember you need to know the weaves
OOCly before you can know them ICly.

Ranks (Gaining and Losing them)
1. Instead of completing little syllabi for each advancement
in rank, which can be a royal pain in the ass, the promotion

      <text>is going to be entirely RP based. This is taking into
consideration the shifting loyalties and power struggles that
constantly go on under the blanket of the Shadow.
2. What this means is that you can advance in one of 
several ways.
a) To take out a person of a rank higher than you through
plotting and other machination. This doesn't mean an all out
battle, this means planning and thinking. Just because you
capped at 274 doesn't mean you are going to be able to fireball
your way to the top. You need alliances of power to wage war.
Get enough power behind you and just maybe a Chosen won't come
after you for killing one of their favorite playthings. Of course,
I am going to need logs, logs, and more logs to verify any
of this.
b) To successfully plan and carry out (at least attempt to carry
it out, it could fail and still count) several plots that either
advance your character in IC power in other guilds, to hurt targets
that are fighting against the Shadow, or just cause general unrest in
the world. Plots that garner significant IC information will also
be rewarded. Know though, that this way of advancement is the slower
of the two. You will have to be recognized for doing your duty. If
a pet performs a trick and the master is not watching, the pet may
not get rewarded. Do the trick over and over again until the Master
sees it and you, the pet, may be well rewarded. Again, I need logs 
and lots of them to prove you are out there working.
3. You can lose rank too if someone below you takes you out or if
someone outperforms you in the field. The Master does like failure,
nor do any of his higher ranking minions. If someone else is better
suited for the job, know that you can and will be replaced.
4. This is a trial system. If it is abused, I'll go back to the
drawing board. I just figure this would be a unique system that was 
bound to spawn RP. A constant struggle is always good to keep
people active.

      <text>The Dark One, the Great Lord, the Master of Death has been watching the
movements of his followers. The Master Dreadlord has been proven obscelete,
and has been removed... as well as most of the leadership. Only narrowly
did these individuals avoid death. Those who are worthy will be rewarded...
Those who are not, will be killed.
 
**tacked overtop of all the other postings, a huge black sheet despite
that the message is not very long**
 
OOC - Shai'tan's eyes are on each of you. As the message says, there will
be rewards, and there will be death. If you are summoned to Shayol Guhl,
assume it is the latter, and do not make plans to join the Dark again...
If Shai'tan has to kill you himself, he will know your reincarnation, and
to draw his attention back to you is to invite the worst kind of torment.

      <text>As I have said before, and will say again.  I am generally available for

      <text>The board has been cleaned. If anything was removed that you'd like to see 
posted again, mail either myself or Tiekith or repost it yourself. Do not 
forget that you have two GLs watching over the guild. If you have ideas, 
thoughts, comments about anything, we're here to listen and help.

That is all.

The new DL guild weave, 'Wrath', is now available. Ghelp file should be
arriving soonish. Room seal now works as advertised instead of as dome of
air.

A friendly neighborhood tip on good emote channeling:

Do not under any circumstances use losing control of the One Power as a
way of producing results you could never achieve normally. An example would
be losing control of a shield weave and ending up severing someone or 
losing control of an explosion weave and achieving three times the area of
affect that you normally could. Losing control of the Power does not make
you superman. In fact, the best you can hope for is just losing your grasp.
It is very possible to still or kill yourself by losing control of your
channeling. On top of that, it is incredibly bad RP. Some will think the
following example is an exaggeration, but it is not. Losing control of
channeling to do things you can't normally do is like trying to deadlift
200 pounds more than your max, slipping and falling, and as a result hurling
the weight 50 yards. Flubbing something does not grant you massively
increased strength.
