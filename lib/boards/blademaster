      <text>Since the board is clean, I thought I'd start a new thread.

Recently I was in a spar where someone emoted they were basically
striking at my legs with a move equivalent to &quot;River undercuts the
bank.&quot; 

Well I stepped out of the spot he was striking at, so his following
emote was changed so that he was no longer striking at that area.

This little occurance got me to thinking about just how committed are
the emotes to the actions we do.

With the upcoming tournament, I figured it was a good topic of
discussion.

      <text> Good thing to start with.

Well to my response to your thoughts I would say that what your opponent
tried to pull off would not work...it would not be hard enough to do
any damage...so we are always going atleast 3/4 of our max strength.

Basically to change in mid move to another to much power is lost and
you could not cut anything like that...unless you changed the
momentum (damn I sure as hell can't spell) with a...how to put this...
little circular motion, and that in itself takes more time leaving you
completly open to a counter strike if some one knows what and where to
strike.

So back to your oppenent's move he would have had to move his weight
from one foot to the other and keep the speed of the blade a constant.
You can not got from a horizantal slash to a vertical with out the
rounding motion and expect it to cut either deep enouth or through
to make the part usless...For and example
Say I make a slash at you right leg about half way up your calf and
while I am doing that your are slashing at the left side of my neck
(both swordsmen are right handed) I can't in mid slash make it go
straight up toward your arm I would have to turn the slash upward
more than likely toward your left hip (granted that neither person
would really go for an attack while being attacked so this is a bad
example but I think it gets the point across).

      <text>Belfore,

Thanks for your response... but I think I failed to state my concern
correctly. It wasn't anything about the specific move done against me.


The issue that I wanted to bring up was basically can something that
was written in a previous emote be negated when your opponent does
something you don't expect? That was the impression I had received that
this other person was trying to do in this spar.

He emoted striking towards my legs. I moved defensively so my legs were
no longer where he was striking at. Should he be able to say &quot;well since
you moved from where I was aiming, I'm do &lt;blah&gt; instead.&quot;? Or should he
start off his next emote following through completely where his last
emote left him off?

      <text>First, let me point out that I'm not a blademaster with a heron.
Therefore, I'm likely to be dismissed but I feel like sharing my
opinion anyway.

I think it's bad form for both people competing in that spar. Once
you do an emote stating that you are swinging for the legs of some-
one, how would it be legal to state, &quot;Okay, that didn't land, let's
back up and I'll try again.&quot;  I had thought we were here and trying
different things -within- the spar to reach the other person, ne?
He's taking the fun out of it, you're allowing him to act less than
appropriate. So to answer the question, backing up because he didn't
land a hit, would not be correct.

My God, can you imagine if that was how it worked? We'd never be
able to finish a spar. C'mon, I mean, you do realize that if you are
in a ready position.. there's no real way he could catch you off 
your guard and strike, yes? Wouldn't that be just a bit too out there
somehow?

My .$.02 on the subject.

It honestly doesn't matter if this is emote fighting or just emoting of
any kind. Changing your actions after the fact leads to the ridiculous.
As always, I have a ridiculous example:

Bob gets up and leaves the tavern, slamming the door behind him.

Jane turns to Bill and says, &quot;Bob sure is a rude ass, isn't he?&quot;

Bob changes his mind and sits back down again, furious that Jane is talking
about him like he isn't even there.

I honestly would have thought this was a very basic concept of emote
fighting and that it was not something about which any veteran of this
guild would have questions.

-Tze

P.S. I think Belfore and Gwendolyn adequately addressed this. I just haven't
used Jane and Bob in a long time and couldn't resist throwing up an example.

      <text>Well folks, I had intended to try to encourage discussion in the way I
posted my first message on this subject. To be honest, I was really
pissed off when this other player pulled this on me. What I ended up doing
was stopping the RP after the player refused to take my word on the matter.

My intent was not to ask you about what I should have done in the matter,
it was more to say don't do this in your spars.

      <text>Well, Vlemar brought up a very good point. I've always felt that the
main limitation of emotefighting was that it was somewhat too segmented. I
rarely saw a truly fluid combat, which would indeed create the image
of speed that a true swordfight would have. Well, what can we do about it?
Ok, this was just me dreaming about MUDs which will have Virtual (matrix style) 
technology...like that'll happen...
Coming back to Vle's point. The thing with forms as Jordan described them, 
following Japanese Kenjutstu style, is that they should usually be only
a couple of exchanges without all that parrying and jumping like
in Western fencing....I've seen a thousand samurai movies and in all of them
them two guys practically have one shot at eachother, and whoever is
better, or luckier wins.
However this would not make for very exciting RP...
I've always tried to emote this way. emote my attack, then try to parry
my opponent's attack (avoid it, whatever),THEN attack
Whatever you say, what we're doing in emotefighting is closer
to chess than to actual swordplay, soo...wait for your turn...
Ok, i hope you had the patience to read all this.

      <text>Hey all just thought I should bring up a point that I feel has been
over looked.

Lannes said that the style Jordan described to us was Kenjutstu...but
who said that is the style we all use? I for one use some of what I
do in the sword fighting I do (padded sword so that changes it) and
I might just pull out something I have seen in actual use (be it TV or
some one I know) or even something that has been described to me...
such as Cut and Trust...My point is that we do not have a universal
style here and what one person does may be completly new to another...
and then that person my intigrate that into their own personal style
and that is what I think of when fighting someone...I fight and watch
andthing that has to do with swords really to make my self better in
everything I do that involves any type of sword be it and actual IRL
sword or just the word sword. And in my oppinion that is what makes
this guild so damn good...we have so many different styles and
techniques of thoses styles that even fighting the newest person to
emote combat (or Dueling since that is sorta what we do more often than
not) that we can not help but get better.

I think I have babbled enough for tonight.

      <text>I find this question more interesting then most I suppose. It is very
easy to just dismiss Vlemer's opponent out of hand and say he shouldn't
have done that if that's what the MUD wants to do but it's not quite so
easy to justify it. Me, I'm of a slightly different mind on the issue
then some others I suppose. Forms and emote's here seem to tend to
create sequences of several movements so that a character may be doing
2, 3 or even 4 distinct actions within a single emote and this can
cause problems similar to what Vlemar mentioned. Consider someone doing
a downwards left-to-right angled slash across the torso followed by a
low right-to-left horizontal slash over the knees, what happens if the
attack sequence it locked up in the first motion? The blade is trapped
and say the opponent tries a disarm before the low horizontal slash is
even reached? It may be perfectly reasonably and legitimate but it
must by necessity negate the secondary horizontal slash as never being
able to have happened yet. Now, this is a situation where neither player
really has a personal say in whether a sequence of movements would/should
be considered completed since it clearly would be impossible within the
scope of realism to be so. Say the blade wasn't trapped and, as Vlemar
did, he moved in such a way that the subsequent horizontal slash would
be not only countered but also a waste of time and energy ICly to continue
to execute, would it make IC sense for a character to continue with it
anyways and waste the effort, movement, and expose their position
potentially because they emote'd it earlier in anticipation of Vlemar's
reaponse being different then it was? It would be very poor IC strategy
to commit to a movemement that clearly can have no benificial effect,
but I'll admit it might simplify emote fighting OOCly without having
to backtrack. It's a concern that is simply going to come up again and
again with multi-action emote's that aren't matched at each action by
an opponent. If Vlemar had incorporated the horizontal slash into his
own response, perhaps moving firt out of the way then attacking the
blade from behind to push it further out of position then no, his
opponent wouldn't have much right to justify backtracking through an
action because it would have already been performed and responded to
and thus locked into the emote fight timeline. If Vlemar just left
it completely open and didn't do anything to interefere, interact, or
respond to the secondary horizontal slash however then I can see it
being justified in backtracking to not complete  an interrupted sequence
of movements which would ICly be ridiculous to continue in the situation.
Perhaps it's not just a question of should Vlemar's opponent have
been allowed to backtrack but also of should all movement/attacks in
an emote have a response/defense required in the emote of the other
character, or should larger sequences of emotes with 3 or more attacks
really be removed from common usage entirely? One could easily argue
that a sequence of 2 movements would be completed/continued even when
it becomes pointless to do so after the first as a result of the time/
reflex it would take to change the anticipate action sequence ICly. Ah
well, as I said, there is some argument either way :)

      <text>Every combat emote necessarily contains more than one action, reckoned by
the strictest definition of 'single action'.  Any idiot who merely moves
one foot, or shifts one wrist, or flexes one muscle, is guaranteed to lose
a spar, if not die.  This isn't really the issue, here.  The issue here is
one of chronology - how many actions are taken during a period of time I
see as beginning with the completion of a single initial parry.  Why only
a single initial parry, rather than responses to a flurry of blows, such
as described in Iavoe's post?  Because that sort of emote is absolutely
not acceptable in emote combat, for reasons which should be quite obvious
after even the most casual consideration.  Nonetheless, since we seem to
be discussing them, I'll elaborate - by allowing one person to take any
number of sequential (in other words, &amp;unot&amp;n chronologically simultaneous)
actions, you destroy the basic give-and-take flow upon which emote combat
depends.  It's a matter of closing emotes.  If I emote swinging my sword
at my opponent 17 times in one emote, I effectively closed emote them by
forcing them &amp;unot&amp;n to stop me from swinging my sword 17 times.  It's a
subtle but fundamental point of emote combat that it depends on an exchange
of open-ended emotes between two or more parties.  An emote, in order to
be open-ended, needs not only leave one's opponent a window in which to
respond, even if an attack may seem unavoidable, it must not infringe upon
the chronological spacing of that window.  Leaving someone an opening to
defend an attack after the time in which the attack may be defended has
passed does &amp;unot&amp;n qualify as an open-ended emote.  (Bob walks up to Jane,
and, before she can even draw her sword, puts his sword to her throat and
tries to slit it.)
This is the reasoning behind the fact that, for the last 5 years or so,
it has been considered gauche beyond description to emote more than one
attack.  In more precise terms - to emote anything which would put one in
a situation where one's opponent will be faced with the sort of question
Iavoe raises.  The answer is not to pick nits about how to respond to an
emote of that sort, it is, and has long been, to simply not emote in that
fashion.  Further, when someone does emote that way, I would say that the
obvious response is to take the opportunity to leave them doing something
really silly, like executing the third cut in a series, while you casually
walk around behind them and stick your sword into them.  (One of the other
fundamental rules of emote combat, which I think applies here, is that
what you emote, you have committed to doing.)  Others have already pointed
this out.  If you allow people to revise their emoted actions when such
actions are proven to be foolish, you negate the entire point of emoted
fights.  To do so would merely be to prove correct those detractors of our
beloved pastime who deride it on grounds of futility.
Emote combat depends upon a series of chronologically consistant actions,
within the recognized bounds of a shared physics, which consist of certain
familiar components.  Each emote &amp;umust&amp;n contain a response to one's opponent
(expressed or tacit - one can always respond by simply ignoring an attack
which poses no threat, for example), and then a very limited action on the
emoter's own part.  This action must be brief - in order to allow the other
player a chance to respond.  If you don't practice this restraint, you in
effect assume that your opponent can't possibly do anything you haven't
already considered.  If you are omniscient, feel free to emote 6 months
worth of actions which your opponent could never counter.  Otherwise, try
to keep the length of your character's actions within the boundaries of
the indisputably possible.  As a guideline - never emote anything which,
were you mortally wounded at the moment of first action, you could not
complete.

      <text>All right...here I go.
I've noticed that there haven't been any Herons awardede in..like a year,
although there has been an attempt to offer some, a few months ago. Also,
in the logs that I've read i've seen very few blademasters RPing...
This has lead me to this post, in which, i humbly ask the IMMS to
consider awarding some new Herons, mainly to some RP activemudders.
I am not a total hypocrite, so I won't deny that i would like one
of those herons myself, but that, i believe i another matter, one that should
be decided by those who believe i deserve one. 
Anyhow...i'd be glad to see some herons given to people who WILL rp, 
and who will not just stay in the corner saying...look , i'm a 
Blademaster....
So, please take my request into consideration. Thanks.

      <text>So what if no Herons have been awarded?  I think the last time they were, to many
were given out.  And if they do award new ones, I think Warders should be the -last-
ones to be considered for a Heron.  Warders should not be preoccupied with seeking
a Heron, as it just draws unwanted attention to yourself.  Sure a Heron is a nice thing,
but it really is not that big of a deal that some make it out to be.  So I say
be patient Lannes, cause I know of a few people who have been waiting far longer then
you have (myself not included).

      <text>I've got to go with Lannes on this one.  I know Tze will hate me for it,
but I think it's probably worth opening applications again.  It's been a
while (since before the last Tournament?  Not exactly sure) and there is
really only one active Blademaster on the Mud right now.  There certainly
seems to be room for one (or maybe even two) more, and I'd be an idiot if
I said there was no demand for those slots.  Personally, I don't see what
Alton's comments about warders have to do with the issue at hand.  If a
warder applies, a warder applies.  If one doesn't, so what?  As for a heron
not being a big deal - if someone doesn't want one, they don't have to
apply.  If someone else does care enough to bother applying, good for them.
As for myself - I would just sort of like to see some Blademasters around
- the better to hunt one down, beat 'im up, and steal 'is heron.  Bwahahah.

      <text>Just a few cents tossed into the kit from an old BM, one of those who've
since gone into activity both by choice and by design. Not going to get
into that though except to point out that there are many, like myself,
who went or were placed as Veteran's due more to OOC issues then IC. Hell
were things different then they were, as I haven't really noticed any change
since I went on hiatus, I might even return to full activity eventually.
That said Lannes is right in that there could be more active BMs around,
not including &quot;Veterans&quot; or the one &quot;Former Blademaster&quot; whatever that
means there are only 2 period and I'm not active enough to vouch for
either of them. Gaudior did take part in the tourney at least which is
nice to see :) Without visible and active BMs, and I'm not saying there
should be many, interest in the field wanes and with a decline in interest
there is a definite decline in overall competence and ability which is
regretable. On the other hand you have the problem of potentially
changing or compromising the system depending on how it's done, not that
everyone would necessarily disagree with that. I mean what if there just
isn't many active who are just plain good enough? Do you lower the
standards to fit the MUDs average? Do you remove the OOC quotient 
completely so that emote skill really doesn't matter anymore? Or do
you just try to get the current BMs out there more and getting those
who might be skirting the edge of BM-level skill over the hump and into
the upper echelon? Personally the latter would be my option, but I'm 
neither in charge nor active here beyond a few hellos and the occasional
insightful echo from the past on this board. In conclusion, before anyone
goes jumping on it, some of the termiology I used, like &quot;upper echelon&quot;
might be interpretted as BM elitism or bias when it wasn't intended to
be, rather it was the most convienient and easily understood term to
use. Ie don't use my post to start a whole 'nother rant on how old BMs
are suppressing everyone, huddling in our dark corners scared of losing
the bird or accepting that there might be others out there better
then we are. It's not meant that way and, to be blunt, right now I don't
have the energy to care enough about the bird or the MUD to hold such
a draining viewpoint even did I wish to ;)

I would personally love to have more active BMs on the MUD. I'm not sure
that opening up applications will give us any, though. It is something
that I talk about with the other admins, though. And something that will
be discussed again.

In regards to Iavoe's comment about just handing them out because we need
more of them, I personally do not consider that when voting. And most of
the &quot;Veteran&quot; or inactive BMs could get full status back simply by being
active. Most of them find having to actually play here to keep that status
to be insulting for some reason, though.

To Lannes' comment on not seeing any logs by Blademasters, I can't speak
for Gaudior, but even if I were RPing every day, you likely wouldn't see
any logs. I rarely submit them since I don't care about the QPs and if I
want to go to the effort to send them in, it's just as easy to put them on
my own webpage. Also, most of the people who apply for herons are not
active. You would be amazed (unless you've been around a while, in which
case you'd just say &quot;oh, typical&quot;) with how many of the applicants apply
on the last day of the deadline because one of their buddies hunted them
down on the MUD where they really play and told them that applications
were open. When the first time someone has logged on in two months is the
day they applied for their heron, it is really hard to take their claims
of activity at face value. In fact, it makes the vote really easy since
there is no need to take their word on anything else they put in the
app.

The other two votes in this might have a different take on it. This is
just how I see it. In my opinion, the bottom line is that if you want
more active BMs on the mud, be active and submit a good application.

Oh, a little hint. Including something in your application that goes like,
&quot;I realize there's a lot of stupid shit in my background, but it was
acceptable back then,&quot; does not help your case. It just points out that
the background is flaky.

If you want a heron and you think you're good enough and active enough
to take one, do so. The ability to take initiative and generate RP on
your own is one of the points on the application. Idling at the guild
board while waiting for us to open the process again is not showing
initiative.

I can see where you're coming from in that regards, opposition to a
hard coded activity requirement to BM'ry has been strong and vehement
in the past when the issue arose which, naturally, led to the Veteran
rank of which I find myself currently distinguished. That in itself I
have no problem with, though I'm not a fan of set in stone activity
requirements in general since viewpoints both MUDwise and personal
activity are so variable in that regards I have no problem with those
like myself who've stepped away from things being designated with
a Veteran rank. I miss the Blademaster immtitle, but that's life.
What I did have a problem with way back when was the imputation that,
because I was set as Veteran OOCly for reduced activity (though at
that time I was still playing on occasion, just not enough to
satisfy the powers that be) that somehow I was to lose the status
of BM ICly as well, as if skill could be cut away from a character
with a scalpel. It was this OOC imposition on the IC life of my
character that I personally objected to in those discussions, not the
shifting of BM's to Veteran when their activity has waned...hell, I
seem to recall asking to be moved to Veteran when I was at that :)
Of course, I don't speak for others and I do agree with you that
many old BMs now gone or Veteran did argue strongly against activity
requirements, I'm just clarifying that I wasn't so much one of them
as your posting may have implied. OOC reductions as a result of
activity are reasonable im my book, especially when a cap on BMs
was or is being enforced. It was simply the concept of having this
OOC status externally imposed upon my character's IC life against
my and his will that I disagreed with. That ein at least doesn't
seem to be to much in issue anymore at least :)

      <text>I love rehashing old arguments!  I really do!  This is not sarcasm at all!
Now, about what Iavoe said...  Hmmm...  Lemme dig out the old cut an' paste
rhetorical skills....hmmm...Here we go!

&quot;What I did have a problem with way back when was the imputation that,
because I was set as Veteran OOCly for reduced activity (though at
that time I was still playing on occasion, just not enough to
satisfy the powers that be) that somehow I was to lose the status
of BM ICly as well, as if skill could be cut away from a character
with a scalpel.&quot;

I see the point.  It's a fairly good one.  There is one fairly subtle
distinction I would like to make, though.  Nothing that is done in this
guild now, or that I can recall ever having been done in the past, has
ever affected the way a player roleplays their character's skill with a
blade.  Waaaay back when a few real dummies tried to argue that anyone
without a heron should always go out of their way to lose spars to the
people who did have herons.  I have never suggested, and to the extent
of my knowledge, I am on the same page as the current guild leadership,
that possesion or lack of a heron has jackshit to do with how well any
given player should emote their character's skill with a sword.  To put
it a bit less circuitously, no one ever &quot;cut skill away from characters
with a scalpel&quot;.  They... Er.  Well, actually, it was me.  I just cut
away a sword.  A physical object.  The ownership of which was negated.
I hope you're not all too bored with this little foray into our ancient
history.

-&amp;bKatore&amp;n

P.S.- By way of an apologetic justification, there is some relevance
for us here, today.  The point stands - Nobody &amp;uelse&amp;n should ever be
asked, or even permitted, to tell you how good your character is with
a sword.  That's your choice to make - hopefully with at least a few
grains of common sense and good taste.  &quot;I can kick Lan's ass with my
left hand!&quot; probably isn't a very wise decision in this department.
But losing a tournament can always be retroactively cast as bad luck,
or an inconvenient stomach bug, or whatever, if you must...  And if
you've OOCly got the talent to roleplay a really good swordsman, as,
presumably, all of those &quot;Veterans&quot; do - then go right ahead.

We (the administration) are considering running another tournament. If
you are interested in participating, feel free to mudmail either myself
or the new CREATOR. Or you can just post on this board. Unless there is
sufficient interest, we won't host this event. If we do have the tourney,
it will be open to the entire MUD, not just members of this guild. So, if
you want it to happen, take an interest and promote it.

Something else we need to discuss is scoring options. What categories do
we use? Do we weight any of them? Do we even bother with categories? This
last option is rather interesting and I don't believe has ever been tried
here. We could run something like a double elimination competition with
brackets and such and have a list of acceptable judges or use the other
entrants or some combination of the two. Have a minimum number of these
judges watch each match and make instant rulings on any disputes. Then
whoever icly wins that match advances. Lose two matches and you're out.
Would anyone be interested in this? Would it even be viable? Or would the
lack of anonymity make the judges more timid? If there is no discussion,
I'll just assume that either there is no interest. It's your tournament,
after all.

      <text>...isn't humble at all, dammit.  I think we should give Cappen's idea a
shot.  I remember a quest, way back when, run along very much those lines,
and it was an unqualified success.  Everyone had a lot of fun, and instead
of weird and inexplicable warps in the fabric of reality (swordsman X drubs
swordsman Y soundly, and then swordsman Y advances while X is out of the
tournament on bad realism scores, or whatever) there is a nice, uniform,
easy to follow IC storyline to the Tourney.
As for the judging concern...  It would be possible to have blind judging
if it was judged worth the effort...  With preset match times, and by use
of mirror rooms, namesets, and the like.  Probably pointless, imo, but you
are all welcome to have differing (i.e. wrong) opinions.
All in all...  I definitely like the idea, and as always, my name is in
the hat to participate, or to judge, as the administrators of this little
event see fit.  Anyone who wants to debate the real-time sparring idea,
please drop me a line so I can rant at you.  ;)

      <text>I would definitely be in favor of a tourney. However, I don't know that
I would be all that excited about doing it live time with people standing
around watching. Been there, hated it. If you're going to use those nifty
little mirror rooms, then what's the point of it being a live spar? It's
like someone looking over your shoulder that you can't see. You know that
they're there, but you can't quite get it out of your head. Maybe it'd be
easier if they were -right there-, but I doubt it. Matter of personal
preference and consideration on my part.

In addition, I think it would be more difficult to get accurate judging.
If you do the logs and send them, they can read them and score them without
the benefit of names as well as not having to feel like anyone is going
to know how they scored their best friend. I think it would just be a bit
more simple for them if they weren't seen.

All in all, probably better for everyone. Not to mention, you only have to
worry about matching times with one person during the tourney.

      <text>Oh, i'd definetely be interested in such a tournament...
The scoring...hmm both tanen and gwen raise good points.
I think i'd like the direct elimination thing, but indeed i don't know how the judges would manage that, and it's hard to keep your mouth shut while watching...
yet it might be a bit more fun, and after all this IS about fun.
anyways, why don't we give this a try...also it might help if we got a &quot;live&quot; ooc judge whowould rule on disputed emotes..i mean, we do have things that are contested
and if it happens you can't just cut off one player''s realism score cause
it affects the way the other emotes too.
it'd be fun..if we got enough players...in the range of eight or more...to have 
a 'round robin' type event...split them into two groups..make them fight 
all the others in the same group, and then the two with most wins in both groups would go into semifinals and then a finals?
Just an idea...

      <text>Since there seems to be some hesitation about employing the idea of live
judges in a full tournament (and the point about needing to get more than
two people online at once is particularly valid), perhaps we could try a
little experiment with the idea, and see if it catches on.  I'd be happy
to participate in, or judge, a real-time arbitrated bout or three, maybe
in a quest environment?
It would be fairly easy to set-up, and would simply require 2-3 people to
serve as judges, and enough other people willing to do quick bouts.  By
totally tossing out the whole notion of Style and Strategy categories, the
whole thing gets significantly streamlined, and it opens the door to less
experienced emote-fighters to give it a whirl.  Having participated in
something of the sort before, I suspect that I'd have a lot of fun, though
I'm not sure about anyone else.  I have, as you all know, weird tastes.

My slightly-more-than-two cents.

In the US, it is Thanksgiving Day today. Two members of this administrative
convenience (i.e. guild, but without the risk of a capital letter), will
be very thankful and most likely surprised. Details soon.
