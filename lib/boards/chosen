      <text>The Great Lord of the Dark is my Master, and most heartily
do I serve him to the last shred of my very soul.
Lo, my Master is death's Master. Asking nothing do I 
against the Day of his coming, yet do I serve 
in sure and certain hope of life everlasting. Surely the
faithful shall be exalted in the land, exalted above
the unbelievers, exalted above thrones, yet do I serve
humbly against the Day of his Return. Swift come the
Day of Return. Swift come the Great Lord of the Dark
to guide us and rule the world forever and ever.

      <text>A suggestion from your loving Lord. Whenever you enter rp you think
will end in someones death, controversy or whatever I suggest you
always take a log of it. Logs may seem like a hassle and to some, 
like myself, and are practically worthless as they can be faked but
to alot of people it represents your willingness to tell the truth
and your honesty about the situation as well as a sense of professionalism
Many a controversy about an IC kill have been ended by someone
producing a log and they stand as evidence to your proper proceedure
You are supposed to be regarded as intelligent and responsible
players so a log will do no harm to any defense I may have to muster
on your behalf when someone whinges to me about how they are supposed
to be able to shield you or something. Its just a suggestion but
if you do have the ability you would be well advised to follow it.

      <text>Darkdream is an ability ALL darkfrinds have. It is not a skill
as such but something that anyone guilded in the Darkfriend
guild can do as soon as they are guilded. It seems most of you
do not know this so here is a brief explanation of what it does

Darkdream allows any darkfriend, while sleeping to enter the 
World of Dreams. Unlike dreaming you do not dream yourself into
the room you went to sleep in but rather, you ALWAYS dream 
yourself into &quot;The Meeting Chamber&quot; Here you can give or take 
orders from other darkfriends without having to ICly leave your
place of residence (such as a novice from the Tower) to meet
with people. It can be done covertly and at any time. I have
recently redone the room and extra descriptions for the chamber
and it makes a nice little place to chat with your minions. I
encourage you to use it as an IC alternative to Gating into
places that -might- expose you and your minions.

      <text>If you are entering another guild area, or any rp area, with the
intent or rping then be IC before and on arrival.
Please inform the GL host of that area that you intend to rp, though
you are not required to reveal what. If they are not online or you
cannot see them online post a short message telling them you intend
rp in their area.
In regard to gating into a foreign area, Gate is an IC weave and will
carry all the IC consequences. Do not gate into places like Salidar
or Tar Valon unless you have FIRSTHAND knowledge of that guilds gating
entry/exit requirements, and follow them to the letter. Otherwise you
will be forced to gate to a region outside the area and walk in using
disguise or some other similar method.
Lets keep it realistic and meet all the forms :)

      <text>As Chosen you pretty much have every skill under the sun. As
Chosen you should also NOT be telling people what skills
you have. No mort needs to know, no one needs to
know. Darkfriend skills especially are for all intents
and purposes only for darkfriends of sufficient rank 
and standing within the guild. No one is supposed to
know what the skills are unless they have them.
The skills are a reward for effort and dedication.
Knowing there are skills is enough, do not dicuss them
with people.

      <text>This is in no way an attempt by myself to take over
the Chosen, so banish that thought from your minds.
Now, in light of Cyndane's post about powertraps
and how Chosen cause trouble. Let me make this
very clear for ALL of you that possess Chosen
alts:
The Chosen are cold, cruel and, above all else,
CALCULATING. Everything that they do is part of
a plot. They do not randomly set powertraps.
They do not go around 'stirring up trouble'.
The Chosen have been around for thousands of
years. They are the ULTIMATE self-preservationists.
They will do ANYTHING to not lose their immortality.
That means that ANY action they take, and plan they
set in motion, anything at all, is carefully thought
out ahead of time and then acted upon in the most
careful manner possible.
If you are interested in causing random bits of
trouble or making use of your code skills in
order to make things difficult for other players
with no set goal in mind, then I suggest giving
up your Chosen and assuming the role of a
Darkfriend. They are responsible for creating
day to day evil. The Chosen weave plots that
involve so much evil that it's subtle, sneaks
up on you, but once it does, it takes more than
soap to wash away.

      <text>OOC:

Like the post on the darkfriend board says, if one of your minions wants to be
a Dreadlord - or you want him/her to be one - then just gate on over to the camp
in the Blight or have another Dreadlord take your minion there. You all know
where the camp is ICly (oocly gate to Gating). You are free to walk around in
it and have RP there, of course, though remember that not all Dreads will know
all of us by first sight. One thing is that you should be considerate to the
structure of the place and not make it your personal hangout. The camp should
function without our constant supervision, and that includes us not giving
lessons to the recruits. Our purpose is individual, so pick favorites and help
them out, but please, refrain from spreading any spells out to the masses on
your own. Have your minion do it instead. Thanks.

      <text>Just a few things. The Policy as stated in the above posts is avaliable 
in helpfile form. \c01FSPOLICY\c00 is accessible anytime and I expect each of
you to be able to convince me you have read it if so required.
The next point is about activity. I have had an increasing number of people
ask me lately about rp concerning particular Chosen that are, without 
question, inactive. I know the hassles and the responsibilities of other 
matters take precedence but really if you cant handle the load or just dont
have the courtesy to tell me you want to resign and just drag it out then
tell me and I will replace you. There are a large number of people just 
praying to get a chance to play one of those Chosen to rule the world 
forever and it is only because I understand that somethimes things happen
that I dont replace the inactives right away. 
The moral to the story is this: TALK TO ME if you know or feel your hours
may slip or die off completly, dont let it dribble on and on. I need 
and want active and competent Chosen.

      <text>I have just read a log and I'm also aware of incidents in which
players attempt to resist compulsion weaves. I find this to be a
insult to the Chosen and myself in general. Unless someone is
grasping, then their chances of resisting a compulsion weave is
nill. Morgase could not resist, Liandrin could not, Elayne/Egwene
and Nynaeve could not. Henceforth, you may take reprisals on those
that wish to think they are immune or can resist it.

I'm the new player of Aran'gar here and once you've read this message

Compulsion anyone?

Ooer, it's just nice to be here, being the first player of Aran'gar in a

You've a new GL, people... It is I, Tabitha, the previous Aiel/Tink GL.
They decided I'm too evil to lead the hippies and the spear-lovers, so
here I am ;)
 
Now... to business.
I am aware of a small handful of Chosen players, and from each of you I
would like whatever RP logs of your current situations that you have on
file. I myself play Semirhage, and Darith's requirement of me was to
submit each RP log as they happened... I think this a good policy. And
furthermore, I would like whatever you have on file also, in addition to
your current activities. I know it's a pain in the ass, but I'll also
be giving out QPs for your trouble, and... let's face it... playing a
Chosen is already a reward of it's own ;)
 
Aside from this, I want each of you doing as much recruiting as you can
stand. This is something I'll be rewarding also, as if having another
DF to torture wasn't enough ;)... OOC, talk to your friends, get them
involved -- everyone should have at least -one- darkie, after all! IC,
go cause some chaos, that's what you were hired for.
 
For the moment, that is all, but keep your eyes on this board... any new
changes will be posted :)
Comments, questions, concerns...? Please address them to me.
 
As a side note, Tzeentch will be helping me with the DLs. We are currently
sharing command... He has some good ideas about restructuring and re-
organizing, and Amarinda thought it would be a good idea for us both to
work on it. Thus, any DL-like issues have to go through both of us.
 
Be evil,

      <text>1, Acting against character.
2, Failing to log each session and send it in. (contactinfo Tabitha)
3, OOCly behaving in a manner unbecoming.
 
That's right -- OOC behavior *is* taken into account with the possession
of a Chosen character. These are the most powerful people in the game at
this point, they are to be used for plots and manipulations and making
dark RP more interesting - not for personal power trips or just... to have.
I assign Chosen players as a gift/favor/compliment, it is not a requirement
nor a quota I have to meet... and as such, OOC reputation and/or behavior
does matter. This means anything from game abuse (cheating) to player
abuse, in RP or out. You all know the rules... and you know what will get
people angry. Flashing tags on OOC are likely to be a source of irrtation,
just as an example. Following people around or entering RP uninvited are
other examples. It's just about taste, people.
 
If there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to approach
me... I want this to be a good experience for everyone, and a fun character
to play.
 
&amp;RT&amp;rabitha&amp;n
 
PS - The list above is by no means conclusive, and I don't take well
to loop-hole-finding... so don't do it please ;)

It is both a pleasure and honor to be among the Chosen. I hope for a long
