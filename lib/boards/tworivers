      <text>Deven Ride is connected!
This room actually leads somewhere now!

Yes, hard to believe but it's true.  After what seems like ages
fixing up the Deven Ride zone, I've made a one way exit from
this room to one of the entrances to the zone.  I've also made
an exit to the Winespring Inn in Emond's Field, one way as well.

Deven Ride is connected to Emond's Field and Baerlon, so it's
entirely public.
The reason for the one way exits is simply this:  I thought it
would be a neat perk to being in the guild, a quick little short
cut to the Two Rivers as it were.  Deven Ride is a -fully-
functional zone, complete with mobs and shops and yes!- all
the rooms have descriptions (unlike some zones I've seen
*coughs-Emond'sField-coughs*).  There's even a mail room
too.

Phew.. okay.. that's about it for now.

Explore!  Exploit!  Enjoy!

      <text>When I started fixing up Deven Ride, I noticed there was
-a lot- of unused rooms.  I used some of them up mind
you, but there's 13 rooms left over.

Right, get to the point.  I thought these rooms could be
used for Player houses/rooms :)

If anyone's interested, please mail me about it.
There would be no cost for this either.

Thanks :)

      <text>Hello all,

I and three Gaidin of mine, along with my children who have been in 
residence in Deven Ride in custody of my Mother are ICly in the area. So
let me know if you would like to do a little RP.

      <text>Myself and Kasim are around the zone, if any would like to RP.  I'm
usually available, and though I am in Emond's Field, I plan on floating
around TR as RP is requested.  Feel free to bother me any time.  :)

      <text>Yes, you as well have a post named &quot;Changes!&quot;  This is slightly different
but still related to the changes with Nations.

The Two Rivers Homeland Guild will be merging with the Houses/Nations
guild. Basically you will keep your gzone, your recall and board, but
you will additionally be in Nations now. This guild has unfortunately
suffered from low activity and little interest. Hopefully, the changes
will help that. Also seeing as it is a homeland, it certainly belongs
with the Nations group. One other slight change.. it will no longer
be recognized as Two Rivers but as Manetheren. Although it is part of
Andor, it is still its own considering Perrin and the Old Blood. Those
of you that are in other guilds, not just this one, you will likely
be put into another additional guild as well. The specific cases that
I am thinking of would be the Black Tower. There will be a sub-guild
called Dragonsworn which includes Asha, LotD, Band.. etc. We'll still
working things out but don't be alarmed if you noticed your guilds
start to look a little bit different than they do now. If you have 
concerns or questions, feel free to talk to me.
