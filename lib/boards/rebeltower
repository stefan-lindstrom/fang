      <text>The boards have been cleaned. If there is anything that you wish to see here 
that was once posted, mail it to me or repost it yourself.

While I'm writing, I may as well bring something up. If you guys have ideas 
for things you'd like to see, quests, or just ideas in general, don't hesitate 
to bring them to me. I'm here to help as much as I can. Please understand that 
if ideas are turned down it is not because I am being mean or don't like you, 
but that the ideas just might not work during the current timeline or it just 
isn't logical or reasonable to carry them out.

In any case, I'm here to listen. Comments, concerns, thoughts, idle chatter?
A quick mudmail or tell works wonders.

      <text>Well, I suppose this is goodbye. It was fun while it lasted but I think 
it is time for me to go.  Catch you on the flip-side! :P

      <text>Err, hi. Erm, although I'm not an Aes Sedai yet, I (hopefully) soon will be, if I pass my test an' all. Just to confirm something, this is NOT a post to find a Warder, but rather a post to find a possible Warder who could train me in the art of combat-emoting. 
This whole training me is to provide me with skill to allow me to emote for an NPC Warder that I may be allowed to have (if I can emote properly). I'm sorry to cause a fuss, and I'm not sure whether I'm actually allowed to post on this board, so if I'm breaking any rules...sorry.
Anyway, thanks for the time of anyone that is reading this. If you can help, send me a mudmail.
Thanks!
From Laeyn

      <text>Just wanted to say, any post expressing any feeling or concern is welcome on this board in my opinion :) :). Never be afraid to speak up.

      <text>Yup! It's here. Have fun with it. There are a lot of puzzles or secrets
to it and not so many mobs. I have signs posted for directions in two
different locations but that's hardly all there is to see and fiddle
with. Enjoy.

Player rooms coming up this weekend. Choose your location. Also, since
they are wagon rooms that we're using, be sure to include the description
you want to show in the room where you have it loaded. Use the other
tents as an example of what I mean.

If you have questions or suggestions, mail me.

      <text>I don't play nice, not in the upbringing I suppose.  Maybe it's these
golden eyes of mine.  *shrugs*  Besides, it is no fun being nice.
If you aren't careful, people will start liking you and want to bond
you, not an attractive situation if you ask me.

      <text>Daveed you would likely bond the first skirt that cared to
chase you. Too much work for us sensible Sedai around here.
