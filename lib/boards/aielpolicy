      <text>&amp;WJi'e'toh&amp;n, Old Tongue for &amp;YHonor and Obligation&amp;n, is more than just
a code to follow, it is a way of life. It describres how a man
(and woman) should act, and how to regain honor if this person
shames him or herself by acting otherwise. This honor is &amp;WJi&amp;n,
while the shame is a loss of it - otherwise called &amp;WToh&amp;n.

Ji is simply the honor that any person has. To say someone
possesses no Ji is to say he is worthless, a da'tsang or worse.
Your Ji can increase if you do certain things, and can also earn you
more respect in the Nation. Som examples of gaining Ji are by
stepping above an ordinary request, such as saving a life outside
of a Feud (large battle) or fulfilling a promise faster than
expected. There are also ways to increase Ji in battle. Anyone
can kill, so it is a great honor if you can touch an enemy without
hurting him (see &amp;RHelp Gai'shain&amp;n). A great warrior shows both
adeptness at battle and control of ability and mind. Ji itself is
a general and broad subject, because it spans everything that you are.

Toh, on the other hand, is very specific. It is the obligation to
regain what Ji you lost from doing a specific, shameful action.
Having unfulfilled Toh makes you less than an Aiel; it is said that
living with shame is worse than any death. In order to regain your
Ji, you must first recognize your obligation and determine the best way
to fulfill it. Only you can decide how to meet your Toh. Others may
suggest courses of action, but they could never know you well enough
to tell you the perfect way. In fact, asking for help would just show
weakness in the both of you.

Toh can be gained in many ways not all necessarily bad. For instance,
if someone gives you a regard-gift you must return the gesture with
another gift of equal value. Or if your life is saved, you must show
proper gratitude. However, Toh also comes from wrongful acts like
stealing, lying, spying, attacking a Wise One, Blacksmith, child, or
pregnant woman, and so forth. After the act, you need to regain the
honor you lost or suffer living with your shame for the rest of your life.

It is difficult to write merely a page about Ji'e'toh, for this code of
life is so much more complicated. It is mostly about saving face and
checking yourself to live cleanly in Society. Once Ji is regained,
the act that caused the Toh is forgotten forever.

      <text>Every now and then I read the books.  Maybe once ever four or five years.  ;)
Anyways, I come across some information you might find interesting.  Some
of it regards the aiel, and some of it does not...

-   An &quot;[average]&quot; angreal allows Elayne to, &quot;...handle twice as much of the
power as Nynaeve...&quot; (B8C2)
-   The Red Ajah, as far as raw numbers goes, is the most popular Ajah for
young Accepted to join upon being raised.
-   Only three societies are known to put anyone &quot;to the question.&quot;  The
Maidens do it, but until her tenth year a Maiden cannot even sit in to watch
such a proceeding.  She cannot participate in it until her twentieth.
The other two societies are the Black Eyes and the Stone Dogs.  Wise Ones
-NEVER- do such things.  They do not even know how.
Sorry, that all comes from book eight, chapter 11 I think.  ;)
-   20 maidens can defeat 10 Seanchan Cavalry and take one survivor for
questioning.  I do not believe there were many casualties among the
maidens because they &quot;ringed the barn,&quot; implying they surrounded the
whole thing while he was being questioned.  It's not certain, though.
Also book eight, chapter 11 (I think).
-   Stone Dogs take an oath to die before fleeing a battle.

I had more but I lost a lot of it.  :)

      <text>Yay, I found what that old Spear syllabus alludes to! It's not perfect,
but it's the only record I still have of those dances (what we as
Aiel call weapon Forms). I'm just going to toss them onto this board
for now just as a place to keep them. Enjoy!

&amp;cCapar Rushes:&amp;n
Bael lunges forward on his right foot and brings his spear down in a
diagonal chop against his opponents left shoulder. He quickly recovers
and draws in, balancing lightly on his back foot before exploding forward
with a quick, piercing stab at the gut.

&amp;cBurying the Spear:&amp;n
Bael steps back and spins his spear in a tight circle, sweeping the
incoming strike aside, then drops the haft low across his shins to
fend off another. He then plants the butt of the spear in the ground
and flicks dirt at his opponent, finishing with a twist of the wrists
and a horizontal slash at his opponent's chest/throat.

&amp;cTwisting Spire:&amp;n (fun and showy dance)
Bael slides his hands together in the middle of the spear and begins to
spin it, blurring wood and metal together around him. He continues
the rotation by turning his body and passing the spear behind his
back, switching lead grip mid-stride..
&amp;GFinish:&amp;n Bael slows the spear for an instant and suddenly tosses it, twirling,
into the air. He twists in his stance and catches it behind his
back, continuing to spin.

&amp;cBite of the Two-Step:&amp;n (yep, there's more!)
Bael steps forward and aims a side blow at his opponent with the spear's
blade, then twists the spear in his grip, aiming a second blow with
the haft at the man's other side. He repeats this a third time again
with the tip, attempting to draw his opponent's guard up before
dropping the haft low and up between the man's legs.

&amp;cSweeping out the Tent:&amp;n
Bael lunges with his right foot and arcs his spear-blade diagonally to
slash his opponent's left shoulder. Quickly he jerks his weapon back and
jabs at the man's knee before side-stepping left and twisting his spear
haft around the man's body to attempt to sweep out his legs, reversing
the motion to sweep his fallen opponent's chest with the blade.

&amp;cRuffling the Feathers:&amp;n (an actual all defense)
Bael centers his weight defensively and casually meets the side blows
with his spear, swooping the shaft vertical and reversing into a simple
figure-eight to fend off the rest.

&amp;cThe Two-legged Hare:&amp;n
Bael shoots the length of his spear above his head in a high block then
circles it around and down to guard his shins, burying the haft under
his arm to cushion the impact of the second blow. Immediately he leaps
back, settling his left leg forward and switching his grip.

&amp;cStepping into the New Day:&amp;n
Bael slides his hand out along the haft and points the blade down, pushing
the whole spear against the attack. He curls it up and returns with
an overhead arc at his opponent's shoulder then, sliding the blade
back, draws in, and aims a piercing jab at the gut, pulls back, and
does the same again, following forwards both times.

      <level>63</level>
      <author>0</author>
      <date>0</date>
      <text>This is a list of all the Societies and an idea of what they do. Only
some Societies were ever fully developed in the books, so this is to
the best of my knowledge.

&amp;rAethan Dor -&amp;n The Red Shields are considered the Police force of
the Nation. They often patrol and always bring up legalities of Ji'e'toh
or whatever is pertinent to the conversation. They make very good
City Patrol representatives, and are always good to have as friends.

&amp;rCor Darei - &amp;nThe Night Spears are just as their name sounds. They
function very well at night, make wonderful scouts or sentries,
and are some of the best at ambushing and sneaking around.

&amp;rDuadhe Mahdi'in -&amp;n The Water Seekers are good scouts and escorts. They
know the land they travel, especially where to find the right spots
for rest sites; places close to food and water.

&amp;rFar Aldazar Din - &amp;nThe Brothers of the Eagle are the loners of the
Nation, much preferring a day alone to a game of Flip. They tend to be
quieter and more distanced from others, but also know more about the
animals and areas of the lands. They are some of the best hunters.

&amp;GFar Dareis Mai - &amp;n Maidens of the Spear is the only Society a woman may
join. However, she would not want to join any other. This Society is filled
with camaraderie and good times, though almost all of this is hidden from
the others in the Nation. Aside from the True Bloods, the Maidens take
Honor most seriously. To a Maiden, you are wed to the spear, not any man.
Maidens make great scouts, though among them, there is much diversity of talent.

&amp;rHama N'Dore - &amp;nThe Mountain Dancers know the terrain and how to adapt
best to it. They are some of the most proficient trackers and climbers
and can always find a trail to or around an obstacle. Sure of foot, they
make good middle attackers in a formation to contain the enemy.

&amp;rRahien Sorei - &amp;nThe Dawn Runners are the messengers of the Nation.
They have the highest endurance and can run great distances at some
of the highest speeds of all Aiel.

&amp;rSeia Doon - &amp;nThe Black Eyes make some of the best sentries, both
day and night, and best eyes for seeing objects or people a long distance
away. When they fight, the dance tends to be silent and ruthless.

&amp;rSha'mad Conde -&amp;n By far the swiftest both of foot and tongue, the
Thunder Walkers make good first attackers, usually in a surprise
flanking maneuver or dead on blitz, because they can get in and out
quickly. However, though they have the best jokes, they do not last long
in endurance tests.

&amp;rShae'en M'taal - &amp;nOften the brunt of jokes, the Stone Dogs are
notorious for being dimwitted and thick-skulled. They make up the rear
guard of an attack - the base of any formation. They also refuse to
flee from a fight, in fact take an oath on it.

&amp;rSovin Nai -&amp;n Instead of the Spear, the Knife Hands prefer closer
combat. They make good side attackers and ambushers, best able to get
in close before the enemy realizes it. They are by far the best bodyguards,
and also manage to have the best rough tongues, though Maidens come
close to matching their insults.

&amp;rTain Shari -&amp;n By far the most serious with Ji'e'toh, the True Bloods
know it better than anyone. They feel that following this Honor as
strictly as possible is the most important thing of daily life.

&amp;WSiswai'aman -&amp;n The Spears of the Dragon is not an actual Society, but
is what the Aiel who wear headbands with the Aes Sedai symbol have named
themselves. Other Aiel refuse to acknowledge it exists, preferring to
think of the Aiel in question as still part of his older Society. Not a
single Maiden will join, as they already hold the Car'a'carn's honor,
something the Siswai hunger for. A Siswai'aman is someone who has grown
to be so fervent in wanting to honor Rand al'Thor.

&amp;BMera'din - &amp;nNot a Society either, this is what an Aiel is known as when
he or she loses or quits a Society due to the Bleakness. Many such
Brotherless have now joined the Shaido because their Societies refused
to let them go as honorable Aiel.

   hidden. Gets its name from its bite, which turns blood to jelly in minutes.

   deadly of all, its name comes from the fact its victims take two steps
   and then die.

      <text>&amp;mCulture&amp;y

Tempered over time by the unforgiving hardships of their land, the Aiel
deserve much of their fearsome reputation. They still veil their faces
before they kill and are equally deadly with weapons or bare hands,
in some cases. Echoes of their ancestors' love of music can now be heard
only as their pipers play the waiting clans into battle. To them, battle
has become the &quot;dance of the spears&quot; in which the steps are lethal. Yet
even today no Aiel will willingly touch a sword even on point of death,
and will not ride a horse unless sorely pressed.

The Aiel begin learning survival skills and the handling of the spear at
a very young age, with games designed to enhance skills, speed, and
accuracy. But they are also taught the intricacies of ji'e'toh and
politics, as well as basic arithmetic and reading. Though the Aiel appear
to live a barbaric life, they value books and literature highly, and are
usually relatively well educated.

No longer totally nomadic, each sept has its particular range, and if
they have a stronghold then they will also have a Roofmistress. Though
the Aiel dress plainly, their homes are usually draped in bright colours
and a variety of textures. The Aiel tradition of looting a fifth of the
goods in any raid or war has allowed some of them to acquire rare goods,
mainly from the other inhabitants of Dascard. With the very occasional
pleasant environment hewn from the rugged land, some Aiel live as nomads
only when following the herds in search of grazing land or when travelling
to battle.

Within each of these holds, a wide variety of crops are grown on terraced
ledges and the flat roofs of houses, though they must usually be
hand-watered in the harsh climate. Gaishain and children usually do this
daily chore. Careful cultivation produces fruits and vegetables for a
healthy, varied diet.

Weaving and jewellery making are the primary crafts, with metal-smithing
close behind. The Aiel mine their own gold and silver, as well as many less
precious ores. They also mine rubies, sapphires, moonstones and fire drops,
though they do not facet-cut any of these gems in their work or value them
highly. Metalworking of any kind is highly valued by the Aiel; smiths may
not be made gai'shain, as that service would deprive the hold of their skills
for a year and a day. Textiles such as wool and grass are woven into a
variety of fabrics. The wool comes from the few sheep and goats that graze
one the sparse ground and the grass that grows in intensely irrigated plots
within each hold. There is very little usable wood in the Waste, and as a
result there are no wood-workers. The few wooden items brought into the Waste
are, therefore, highly prized -- this is why many Aiel feel uncomfortable on
chairs, as they are usually reserved for Wise Ones and Clan Chiefs alone.

&amp;mTHE CODE OF HONOUR AND OBLIGATION&amp;y

The Aiel have replaced the code of passive acceptance with a complex
code of honour and obligation called ji'e'toh. By this code there are
many paths to honour, each with its own measure and price, and each
facet of life has its own paths. In battle, for example, the smallest
honour gained is for killing someone, for anyone can kill, while the
greatest is to touch an armed opponent without causing harm. To take
an enemy and make him gai'shain falls somewhere between the two
extremes. All must seek their own honour through the code, and honour
is valued above all else in Aiel society.

Shame also has many levels within the code, and is considered on many
of those levels to be worse than pain, injury, or even death.
The facet of the code that outweighs all others in all its various
degrees is toh, or obligation; any obligation, no matter how small or
insignificant, must be met in full. Toh is so important to these people
that an Aiel will accept even shame, if necessary, to fulfil an
obligation that might appear minor to one not following the code.

Consider the role of the gai'shain. The name means &quot;pledged to peace
in battle&quot; in the Aiel tongue, and is used to refer to those Aiel taken
prisoner by other Aiel during a raid or battle. These prisoners are
required by ji'e'toh to serve their captor for one year and one day,
touching no weapon and doing no violence during that time. They must
complete this service humbly and obediently with no complaint or thought
of escape. They wear white robes to clearly distinguish themselves from
other Aiel during their service. Even if they are somehow returned to
their own people, that period of service must be completed. Perhaps the
gai'shain are a throwback to the obedient and non-violent service the
original Da'shain Aiel used to give the Tribe of the Snake. Also
according to the code, Wise Ones, blacksmiths, children under the age
of fifteen and women wit children under ten may not be made gai'shain.

The state of da'tsang is one completely without honour. They are cursed
by the taint to be distrusted amongst Aiel, and so they are bound as
body slaves to their entire clan for their own protection, and so that
some use may be gotten from the Tainted Ones.

      <text>&amp;mWarrior Societies&amp;y

Aiel warriors are divided into twelve separate societies, each of
which has its own customs, beliefs, and sometimes specific duties:
Seia Doon (Black Eyes) take the fight against the Dark One into the
Blight, Far Aldazar Din (Brothers of the Eagle) are said to fly
into battle on the wings of the Light, and the Rahien Sorei
(Dawn Runners) are renowned for their immense fortitude and
determination, even by Aiel standards. Sovin Nai (Knife Hands) are
expert in unarmed combat, breaking bones and opening wounds with
seemingly light touches, and the Far Dareis Mai
(Maidens of the Spear) are scouts, like the Duadhe Mahdi'in
(Water Seekers). The role of the Hama N'dore (Mountain Dancers) is
that of the reinforcement in battle, while Shae'en M'taal
(Stone Dogs) defend any retreat that the Aiel must make. Cor Darei
(Night Spears) are the Aiel most like assassins, although they take
no payment for their work -- they simply attack from surprise and
kill swiftly and without noise, wherever possible. The Aethan Dor
(Red Shields) maintain order and act as a kind of police force,
bringing Darkfriends and lawbreakers before the Clan Chief or sept
leader. Sha'mad Conde (Thunder Walkers) are said to enter battle
with the Light at their heels, filling them with strength and power
until they have defeated all their enemies, at which point they are
often devoid of energy for many hours or even days, and finally,
the Tain Shari (True Bloods) are a near-fanatical sect of those Aiel
warriors in whom the blood of the original Serpent tribe runs
strongest, allowing them to channel the Light (in a manner completely
different to that employed by both Wise Ones and da'tsang) to destroy
servants of the Dark One.

Raids and battles between clans have been commonplace since the first
clans were formed, but members of the same society will never fight
each other, even when their clans do so. Because of this there are
always lines of communication open between clans, even during open
warfare.

      <text>&amp;mKinship and Names&amp;y

AIEL KINSHIP AND NAMES
Relationships within the Aiel are both precise and complex. There
is a specific term for every relationship of blood and marriage.
First-brothers and first-sisters are those who have the same mother,
though not necessarily the same father. (Among the Aiel, having the
same mother means a closer bond than having the same father.)
Second-brothers and second-sisters are the children of one's mother's
first-brother or first-sister, and sister-mothers and sister-fathers
are first-sisters and first-brothers of one's mother. A greatfather
or greatmother is the father or mother of one's own mother, while the
parents of one's father are second greatfather and second greatmother.
Kinship terms include some relationships not bound by blood. Friends
who are as close as first-sisters or first-brothers are called
near-sisters and near-brothers. Near-sisters often adopt one another
formally as first-sisters, but near-brothers almost never do.

Marriage among the Aiel is not always monogamous. Within the Aiel it
is perfectly acceptable for a man and two women to marry, though all
must be in agreement. The women are usually near-sisters or
first-sisters, who then become sister-wives. Once joined, they are
considered married to each other as well as to the man. There are,
however, no records of one woman marrying two men. Sexual relations
are not restricted to marriage by any stretch of the imagination,
although it is rare for a child to be born to an unmarried mother.

There are as many terms as there blood ties, but only a born Aiel is
likely to avoid hopeless confusion beyond the terms for immediate family
relationships.

Most Aiel names are as follows: &quot;[given name] of the [sept name] sept
of the [clan] Aiel&quot;. Warriors' names are &quot;[society] [given name] of the
[sept name] sept of the [clan] Aiel&quot;, while da'tsang are rarely called
anything other than &quot;da'tsang&quot;. Gai'shain names are [given name],
gai'shain of the [name of Clan who captured the gai'shain] Aiel and
Wise Ones' names are &quot;[given name] of the Aiel&quot;. So, for example, Rhuarc,
Clan Chief of the Taardad Aiel and member of the Red Shields is
&quot;Aethan Dor Rhuarc of the Dry River sept of the Taardad Aiel&quot;, but one
of his greatsons, Jeriam, is a da'tsang: &quot;Jeriam of the Taardad Aiel.&quot;

      <text>&amp;mAiel Oaths

&amp;y
The Aiel use a few oaths to show their dedication


&amp;mMaiden Oath
  &amp;y&quot;You may belong to no man, nor may any man belong to you, nor any
  child. The spear is your lover, your child, and your live.&quot;

&amp;mGai'shain oath
  &amp;y&quot;I am Gai'shain. Before and after are not now, and only now exists.&quot;

&amp;mOath of Rhuidian
  &amp;y&quot;The Peace of Rhuidean be on you. Who comes to Caendaer may
  return to their holds in peace. There shall be no blood on 
  the ground.&quot;

&amp;mThe Aiel Oath
  
  &amp;yThe long form of the Oath is said by two Aielm and can be said either
  in the spirit of getting psyched up for battle, or as the making of a
  solemn pledge.

  Aiel A: &amp;YTill Shade is Gone,
          Till Water is Gone,
          Into the Shadow with Teeth Bared,
          Screaming DEFIANCE with the last breath!
          To Spit into the Sighblinder's Eye
          on the Last Day.&amp;y
         
  Aiel B: &amp;CBy My Honor and Light,
          My Life will be a Dagger in Sightblinder's Heart!&amp;y

  Aiel A: &amp;YTill the last day,
          Till Shayol Ghul Itself!&amp;y

  The first part may be used by any Aiel as a sort of battle cry.

      <text>&amp;mRules of Conduct&amp;n


&amp;yThe Aiel have certain traditions in which they communicate. 
I.e. the way in which they greet eachother, ask for entrance
to a hold.. etc etc. This file will explain these rules of 
conduct to you.



&amp;mGreetings and such&amp;n

&amp;YI see you [name]
 &amp;yAiel greeting, used regularly
 
&amp;YMy water is yours 
 &amp;ySaid in gratitude, generally.

&amp;YMay you allways find water and shade 
 &amp;yGreeting to a friend or ally.

&amp;YMay you find shade
 &amp;yA friendly goodbye

&amp;YSleep well and wake
 &amp;yGood night



&amp;mTo enter a roof&amp;n

&amp;yIt is customary to enter a hold with your face bare and making
noice so the dwellers will not think you are trying to take it
by surprise.

Every visitor will be &quot;forced&quot; (although it should be voluntarily)
to talk with the Roofmistress on arrival. The words spoken to the
Roofmistress are dependend on the situation and &quot;rank&quot;


&amp;yClan chiefs say this when they ask leave to enter a roof:

 Clan chief:   &amp;YI ask leave to enter your hold, roofmistress.&amp;y

 Roofmistress: &amp;CYou have my leave, clan chief.&amp;y


Sept chiefs say this:

Sept chief:   &amp;YRoofmistress, I ask leave to come beneath your &amp;y
              roof.

Roofmistress: &amp;CYou have my leave . Beneath my roof, there is 
              water and shade for you.&amp;y


Warriors say this:

              &amp;YMay you always have water and shade, roofmistress.
              I ask leave to defend your roof and hold.&amp;y



To one friendless and alone:

 Roofmistress: &amp;CYou have my leave to step beneath my roof. 
               Water and shade will be found for you.&amp;y

&amp;yThe Aiel make their home in the Waste, called Djevik K'Shar,
&quot;The Dying Ground&quot; in the Trolloc tongue. It is a harsh,
rugged, and nearly waterless land. The Aiel call the Waste 
the Three-Fold Land, for they believe it is first a shaping 
stone to make them; second, a testing ground to prove their 
worth; and third, a punishment for their sin--though what sin 
is unclear.

&amp;mCreatures in the waste&amp;y

      <text>&amp;mThe Aiel War&amp;y

The thousand years following the War of the Hundred Years were
a period of growth and prosperity. The nation of Cairhien in
particular had a period of unprecedented wealth. The Aiel granted
the nation of Cairhien the right to cross the Aiel Waste. This
exclusive right allowed the Cairhienin to trade for silks and other
exotic goods in the lands beyond the Aiel Waste, a lucrative trade
which no other nation could compete with. 

In addition to granting the Cairhienin the right to cross the Waste,
the Aiel gave an offshoot of Avendesora to the Cairhienin. This
offshoot, one of the legendary chora trees, was named Avendoraldera.
Laman Damodred became king of Cairhien, and decided to cut down
Avendoraldera to make a throne which would be unique in all the
world. 

Tens of thousands of Aiel crossed the Dragonwall to punish the
Treekiller. The Cairhienin, and indeed the rest of the land, thought
that the entire Aiel nation had emerged from the Waste to do battle.
In reality, it was only four of the twelve clans that crossed the
Dragonwall. Lamans cutting of Avendoraldera came to be known as
Lamans Sin. 

All the nations sent troops to help fight the Aiel, but the Aiel
continued to follow Laman wherever he went. They followed him to Tar
Valon, where the Battle of the Shining Walls took place. The Grand
Alliance had emerged to fight the Aiel, and outnumbered the Aiel two
to one at Tar Valon. The Battle of the Shining Walls was plagued by
snow and bad weather, but the Aiel fought fiercely. At the end of the
third day of fighting, Laman was killed. 

The rest of the world did not understand that the Aiel had crossed
the Dragonwall only to find and punish Laman for his crime. With their
mission accomplished, the Aiel began to move away from Tar Valon and
back toward their home in the Waste. They took with them Lamans sword,
the Power-wrought blade of a blademaster, as proof of their success. 

Following the Aiel War, the years leading up to the present were
fairly calm. Little did most realize that during the Battle of the
Shining Walls, on the slopes of Dragonmount, a baby boy was born.
This boy was the Dragon Reborn.

      <text>&amp;mRhuidean&amp;y

The Wandering of the Aiel ended at the site of what would become
Rhuidean. The Jenn began to build a city. In what would be the
town square, the Jenn planted the last surviving chora tree,
Avendesora. 

Outside the city, the Aiel began to spread out and lay claim to
the Waste. Their numbers grew such that they began to contest
with one another for the resources of the land. They forgot that
they had ever followed the Way of the Leaf, they forgot that they
had ever been related to the Jenn Aiel. 

The Aes Sedai with the Jenn realized they had made a mistake. As
the Aiel grew and the Jenn slowly disappeared, it became clear
that the child of the Aiel who would eventually face the Dark One
would come from the warriors. To save the prophecy, it became
necessary to find a way to remind the Aiel of their roots without
destroying them. 

These Aes Sedai spoke to the Wise Ones through their dreams. They
told the Wise Ones that all the clan chiefs, and all future chiefs,
would have to come to Rhuidean or risk the destruction of the Aiel.
If the clan chiefs came to Rhuidean, they would be able to save
the Aiel people. 

In the heart of Rhuidean, the Aes Sedai constructed a terangreal
that contained all the history of the Aiel. All potential clan
chiefs were required to enter these great glass columns, and learn
their history. Only one in three men who entered Rhuidean ever
returned; those who did had proved themselves to have the strength
to face both the truth of the Aiels heritage and knowledge of the
prophecy that would be fulfilled through them. These men could enter
Rhuidean only once. 

Unlike the men, the women who would be Wise Ones had to enter
Rhuidean twice. On the first visit, they passed through a
terangreal ring similar to the one used by the Aes Sedai to test
Accepted. This terangreal showed the young women their possible
futures. On their second visit, these women had to face the glass
columns just like the men who would be clan chiefs. These women had
a much higher survival rate than the men. 

Eventually the last of the Jenn died. The Aes Sedai protected
Rhuidean from outsiders, and also to preserve it for the Aiel.
Wetlanders knew nothing of Rhuidean - the penalty for any wetlander
entering the valley of Rhuidean was death. Even among the Aiel, only
the chiefs and Wise Ones ever entered the inner city. 

So it was that for almost three thousand years the clan chiefs and
Wise Ones kept the secret of the Aiels history, lest their people
be destroyed. These leaders guided their people while protecting them
from a destructive truth. &amp;n

      <text>Retainers are useful little things, ICly at least. The use of retainers for 
members of this guild is rather limited, however. Since they are supposed to 
have very few IC skills and talents, they make unsuitable Spears or Wise 
Ones. In general, Aiel do not have personal servants. However, Wise Ones may 
have one retainer for use as Gaishain. They will not ever be addressed as 
servants, of course, but they may be used as such. Retainers may also be used 
for characters that would not usually be played by players, such as one's 
child. Otherwise, retainers are not to be used ICly.

If you are going to use a retainer ICly, I must be notified and my permission 
gained beforehand. This does not mean that you must get the nod of approval 
every time you use the retainer after the initial permission is given, but 
if the purpose or name of the retainer is changed it must be gained again. 
There is one exception to this rule. Wise Ones do not have to gain permission, 
but still must notify me of their intent to use a retainer ICly before the 
first time it is used.

This is part of the mud-wide retainer policy and must be followed. If you 
have any questions or concerns, please feel free to talk to me about them. 
If I am not around, drop me a line. You will always get a response.
