When seekers are authorized, would it be possible to have a post on this
board telling what they are authorized to seek? I mean.. I would hope that
it is harder to get a sponsor to be guilded as a High Seat than to be
guilded as a chambermaid to a minor noble. I know my standards for giving
out my sponsorship vary depending on the rank sought.

      <text>This is for the lordlings out there who don't really
have much happening ICly or are simple looking
for a new direction for thier character.

The Band of the Red Hand WANTS YOU!

Any of you guys who've read up through book five
should remember that there are tons of Tairen and
Cairhienin nobility within the Band.  Not only that,
but all these lords hold high ranking military positions
as well.  I am willing to guild lords -as- high ranked
officers based on their backgrounds.  If this is some-
thing that would interest you, please contact me as
soon as you can.  If you don't want to bring your
current lord-type alt into the Band but it still sounds
like something that would be interesting, still contact
me please.  We can work something out fairly easily.
I'm posting this in an obvious (I would think) effort
to try and regain some activity within the guild and
provide more varied roleplay for people so... That is
my intention, not to simply empower a character but
to help the guild and the MUD in general by branching
out of the larger guilds.

I hope to hear from you soon :)

Thanks,
      Hartigan

      <text>This guild now has a full set of gskills. That's right, the full amount
allowed by law. If you take a look at your scoresheet, you'll even find
a few bonuses. First, let me say that I've listed below who gets what
and why, along with updating this information in the ghelps.

Basic changes: Fine was dropped. It had zero code benefits for the most
part. It was a great idea in the concept, but it wasn't that great for
the actual MUD and how we operate. You will also see two new skills that
some of you may not have seen before - Arrogance and Offend. These are
two skills that used to be hunter gskills but were dumped when they put
in a brand new complete set of skills some few months back. In addition
to this, I have moved the good skills from Two Rivers to here - Medicine,
Stubborness, and Survival. Survival was dropped as it was a perfect copy
of Supply. This doesn't mean that all of you have these skills, but they
are now part of the Nations guild.

Commoners: You will receive Supply, Throw, Stubborness, Tail, Medicine,
and Offend. If you are a commoner and not a channie and do not see the
Stubborness listed on your sheet, it is because this skill cannot be
doubled or given if you are part of other major guilds.

Guards/Militia: You will receive Supply, Throw, Stubborness, Tail,
Armscry and Arrest. Just as with commoners, you may or may not have hte
Stubborness skill.

Nobility: You will receive Supply, Throw, Stubborness, Offend and
Arrogance. Just as with the commoners, you might or might not have the
Stubborness skill.

You can find the exact information under the ghelp files as to what
the different skills do. I regret that Stubborness has to have the
bit of a flaw that you can't have it when in other major guilds, but
there are a lot of other bonuses as a whole. The best part is that
there isn't anything else to worry about. You don't have to drag ass
to a GL about it unless you want to discuss the changes, you don't
have to convince someone that the skills need to be changed if you
are on when I'm not, and there is no hassle. The skills are there
for you to play with, all shiney new for ya.

Some of you are channies so there won't be Nations gskills showing on
your sheet. As well, some of you belong to other major guilds an have
maxed the limit of gskills. I did not take any skills from any of the
other guilds and if you had a free spot, I put in the most apt to be
of benefit to you. Most people didn't have their gskills set at their
approved limit, either. This means that some had supply at 83% or some
such. I changed all the gskills that I found to 100% as that is the
limit for their setting. I'm sure that I might have missed some, as I
am aware that I am most certainly not perfect. If you notice that one
or several of your gskills are below 100, feel free to ask to have
them brought up to the max. 

I think that covers it. I'm around if you want to ask questions about
them or whatnot. I encourage you to play with them and report back.
Oh, and one thing, be careful who you offend. *wink*

      <text>I want to take a second and explain that if you sponsor someone, you are
stating that you have roleplayed with this character and find the person
able to RP this specific character. I'd rather give everyone sponsorship
rights but if I catch you sponsoring just because someone is your friend,
you will lose the ability. I tell most all newbies that they need a small
number of sponsors but I need RP logs of the RP. So.. let it be known that
if you sponsor and there's no RP log, it won't count as a sponsor for the
person that you're trying to help out. We need to know people are capable,
especially in a guild where there is no regulation. The guild depends on
you. Don't let it down.

      <text>If you are a noble in the Nations guild then you are entitled to a room in the guild area if you want one.
Mudmail me if you do with a desc of the room and I'll work on putting it in for you.

And if you want a key to go with it, I'll need a desc of that as well. Most ppl use their house sigil or personal sigil to incorprate into their key. All keys will have your name on it, so I can keep up with which rooms have what keys, makes recycling much easier.

If you have questions about all this mudmail me.

      <text>This is just the obligatory howdy post to let you know that I'm now in
charge of all things Nation.  I'll be looking over some stuff the next few
days as well as pondering some roleplay plots.  If you need to get in
touch with me then mudmail is good but any of my information on my
contactinfo will work as well!
