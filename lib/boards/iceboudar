      <text>They're supposed to be IC boards, for use to let others know about your
presence in the different towns, and for people to keep abreast of the
things going on ICly in said towns.  For example, if you were to come ICly
to Ebou Dar, you could post on this board that you're in town looking for
RP or something, or post some event that's going on in the city.

Citizens of Ebou Dar,
     The last vestiges of the resistant against the Seanchan forces have
been eradicated.  The city is now under the complete control of the Empress,
may she live forever.  The Ever Victorious Army patrolls the streets at all
hours, day and night.  Any civil unrest will be met with swift justice.  Any
one entering the city, and all occupants within, must agree to swear the three
oaths, and all horses must be surrendered to the Army immediately.  Trade
will be restricted to Oath takers only, and all goods entering or leaving the
city must be checked at a Gate Post.
     Any information regarding the whereabouts of rebels or marath'damane must
be given to an Officer of the Deathwatch Guard or Ever Victorious Army.  Any
person found harboring such individuals will forfeit all property to the Empress
and suffer a public flogging or execution by beheading.

  Signed in my hand,
     Captain Aaron, Gardener, Deathwatch Guard

Citizens of Ebou Dar!
    Know that these foreign scum who now patrol your streets shall not rest
easy in their occupation, or live long on the shores of our land!  As long
as we draw breath, the true Children of Altara will defy these cowardly
inavders, and that soon we shall triumph, and free the land from their foul
domination!  We shall send them to their graves, or they shall take their
foul monsters, and flee back across the sea where they belong!  Down with
the Shadow!  Freedom from the Tyrants!  Long Live Altara!

Citizens of Altara,
     This city is now a province of the Seanchan Empire.

live forever, or any other Blood or military personel will
result in immediate arrest and a fine of 100 crowns.  A
second arrest will result in death under the charge of
treason.
     Information that helps lead to the arrest of any 
rebel who has committed crimes against the Empress, may
she live forever, will receive a 200 crown reward.
All riots or acts of treason will be put down with
force.

  Signed,
     Captain Aaron son of Garen of the Deathwatch Guard
