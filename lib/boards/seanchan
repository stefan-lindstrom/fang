      <text>Rumor has it that two damane, known as Wisteriah and Keri, have managed an
escape.  During the morning check of the kennels, two a'dam were found on
the ground, the damane in question missing, the two sul'dam last seen with
them nowhere to be found.  Nothing further has been said, but it is
popular belief that the four made it to the forested area nearby and
beyond, so any hunt would be useless.

      <text>The Honor of the Empire has been struck at today with the escape of a
damane.  This must not be allowed.  The damane must be brought back and
taught a lesson in obediance.  I personally have offered to the High Lady
to lead the search party and bring back the runaway.  Any volunteers to
restore the Honor of the Empress, seek me out.

      <text>High Lady Aekin'ya has mysteriously disappeared, and has not been heard
from in quite some time.  Word has it that she was found dead in the
wildernes, although how she got there is unknown.  Others say they heard
she had been imprisoned.  Other rumors say she was found channeling, and
was taken as a damane, although this rumor is very weak.  In any case, the
Lady Kelisa has taken the High Seat in the absence of Aekin'ya.  Perhaps
some day this mystery will be revealed.

      <text>-Written on a piece of parchment, and sent by falcon to the Empress-
I have ascertained the location of both of the damane who escaped, and the sul'dam who accompined them.  Several Gardeners who were part of the hunt for them discovered them several days ago, dead, apparently from bandits.  Both damane showed no signs of stuggle, however, the sul'dam was badly wounded, so there is a possibility she tried to resist.  More disturbingly, they were found with an a'dam on the damane Keri's wrist.  The sul'dam are currently testing it to make sure it functions properly, but this cannot be a good sign, none the less. 
I await your further instructions.

      <text>The Empress, may she live forever, has given the following decree:
The sul'dam who first found the damanes Wisteriah and Keri and trained them
must be sought out.  Determine her name and discover why her damane have
behaved in such a manner.  If she does not provide a suitable answer, she
must be punished.  The Empress, may she live forever, is highly displeased
with this news.

      <text>*a proclamation, sent to all the nobility, with rumors spread among others*
High Ladies, High Lords, Ladies, Lords, and Members of the Blood,
Greetings from the Empress, may she live forever.
Because of the recent captures of a number of Oathbreakers in the
Westlands, the Empress, may she live forever, has, in her infinite grace,
announced that there will be an auction, that all may participate in, to
purchase these prisoners as covale.  This auction is to be held in the
capital city, Seandar, where the Empress, may she live forever, has 
declared that she herself may make an appearance.  This auction is to 
take place over the course of the next few months, as there have been 
so many captured that it will be impossible to hold it in one day.  There
will be a festival to accompany.
The Empress, may she live forever, looks forward to this event, and to 
seeing her subjects gathered together.

*sealed with the mark of the Empress*

*OOC: This is going to be the event in which Davien will be sold.  Due
to circumstances, this is going to be a sort of timewarped event, to 
take place ICly approximately 3 months from this point.  This is to allow
all of you plenty of time to reach Seandar from whatever parts of the world
you happen to be in.  Obviously, this will be near the end of the 
festival event.  The day of the auction in which Davien will be sold 
will be Friday, March 7th, at 8:00 pm EST.  If this is not a good time,
well, send me a message.   Further details on the OOC board about how this
auction is to work.*

      <text>Earlier this week, Lieutenant Aaron was attacked by two marath'damane
in Caemlyn.  They go by the names Krisa and Jessa *following description
of both*.  Should the opportunity present itself, apprehend the two at
will, but use extreme caution if a damane is not present.

      <text>This evening, while in Caemlyn, Lieutenant Aaron captured a marath'damane
by the name of Jessa.  She had been an Aes Sedai previous to this.  Currently
she is being held at the Ramblin' Rose Inn by a damane and sul'dam, but she
will be taken back to Tarabon at the earliest convenience.
Also captured was a young man by the name of Errick.  Little is known of
him as of yet.

      <text>Rumors have quickly spread about a fight in the quarters for House Kirins Covale.
Its seems to have been some bitter blood between one of the Lady Melaina's older Covale
and her newest purchase, an Oathtaker named Ryllen.  It is no secret of the tension
between some of house Kirins Covale, and it seems that the tension finally erupted into
violence, resulting in the death of one of the Covale and Ryllen being sent to the
infirmary.  The whole story is not known yet, but rumor has it Ryllen was attacked in his
room by a jealous Covale, and Ryllen barely made it out with his life.

      <text>As reported by a messenger from Tuon, leader of the Hailene, Daughter of
the Nine Moons, and heir to the Empress, may she live forever.    

The mission to Amadicia has been successful.  The Ever Victorious Army 
has once again shown the glory of the Empress, may she live forever, and
has taken Amadicia.  There have been casualties, but all died for the glory
of the Empire, and have brought honor to the name of the Empress with their
sacrifices.

Our numbers were as follows:
The Ever Victorious Army consisted of approximately 22,000 of those born
in Seanchan, with an additional 14,000 Oathtakers.  About a third of this
number were our air forces, consisting of the Fists of Heaven, their 
to'raken, and the morat'to'raken.  The remaining two-thirds were our ground
troops, consisting of men on foot, as well as the exotics.  Included in the
exotic forces were approximately 60 damane.  We have lost perhaps as many
as two thousand of our troops.

The troops are moving on Ebou Dar and the Daughter of the Nine Moons is
optimistic that this city will be taken as swiftly as the others.  Once
this is done, our supply routes can be changed to move through this city
by means of the sea, rather than overland from Tarabon as it is now.

The remainder of our forces continue to maintain order in Tarabon and Arad
Doman, with no reinforcements to the main troops being sent at this time.

My words are that of the Lady Tuon, Leader of the Hailene, Daughter of the
Nine Moons, and heir to the Empress, may she live forever, and may I be
dishonored if what I have reported are not her words.

      <text>Lady Myra Kirin was found dead in Ebou Dar.  The cause of her death is
unknown, however, it is known that no blood of hers was shed.  Poison is
suspected, but not known for sure.  The Kirin family mourns their loss.
