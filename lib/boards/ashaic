      <text>Asha'man.  Black Tower.  Dumai's Well was your first test, a battle in which 
you have proclaimed to the world and the people living within that you are 
weapons of the highest degree.  A force born out of my guidance and the Lord 
Dragon's desire. A force tried in the midst of battle-blades swinging, blood 
spraying, One Power raging, and death looming. Yet we are victorious. The One 
Power is always victorious, and for that, you should be thankful of your abilities. 
You all know the price; you have before you the choice to attain glory or to fade 
away forever from the annals of history. You are called once more.

Forces of the Shadow have overrun the borderland country of Shienar. Fal 
Moran, its capital city, has been razed and burned to the ground last night.  Men, 
women, children-all dead. Such loss can only be matched by the War of 
Power, the War of Shadow that ended the Age of Legends. They lost their lives 
in defiance of the Shadow. We cannot allow this aggression to go unanswered 
and unchecked, for the possibility of shadowspawn breaking through what 
defenses and fortifications are left between this horde of vermin and our lands is 
just too great. 

A small scouting force, led by the Storm Leader, will Travel to Fal Moran, 
whereupon it will assess the situation before reporting back to me, immediately. 

This is no mere idle threat. You will witness the Shadow firsthand. You will 
come to know why you have trained so hard and have more training yet to come. 
Each of you will become weapons.

For the rest of you, we leave for the Borderlands within the week. Storm Leader 
Gedwyn and Attack Leader Rochaid will be handling squad assignments. See 
the two of them before you resume your training. Dismissed.

Asha'man Athanes, and myself Dedicated Al'Cairn got into a verbal argumen with An Aes Sedai
*Describes Ellaine* She tried to kidnap the young woman that whas shielded, her name is Jessa.
Another Sedai joined the Argument, *Describes Terra* she argued against both us and the other 
Sedai, we felt one of the woman channel and thus I shielded the older one *Ellaine*, the other was
the one channeling though, and released after I shielder her sister. I resumed my patrol after the
girl agreed to go with the younger Sedai, Asha'man Athanes was still with them after I left.
If either of these women are caught channeling let it be known it will be there second voilation of
the law.

I have received a disturbing report. There is a rogue male channeler
operating in Caemlyn. He is responsible for a rather gruesome murder in
the Half Moon Inn. He was described to me as *follows a long, detailed
description of Na'kar* Do not attempt to apprehend on your own. If you spot
him and are alone, seek reinforcements. Not that you should be patrolling
alone, anyway. If at all possible, capture him alive, but protect yourselves
and do not allow harm to befall any innocent bystanders. This man must
be brought to justice with all due haste. We will surely be blamed for
any atrocities he commits. That cannot be allowed to happen.

      <text>I had an unfortunate encounter on my patrol tosday!
I was in the Queens blessing when a man started channeling. This man wore a black cloak and hood, so i could not get a good look at his features. When hre began to channel I grasped Saidin, but as i grasped saidin another man wearing a black cloak and hood grasped saidin and wove explode at me.
Fortunately I was able to duck his weave (rather clumsy) and run back to the Golden Bowl for back-up.
Asha'man Naled Nahsol then proceeded to the Queens blessing to sort out the matter. When next i saw Asha'man Naled nahsol I asked him what had happened and was told that the two rogue channelers got away carrying a whitecloak with them through a GATE!!!!
This man is very dangerous and i would like to emphasise teh point of staying in pairs when on patrol.
For more information on Asha'man Naled Nahsol's encounter please refer to him

I had just begun my patrol in Caemlyn when I noticed a fallen Sedai
(Ellaine), and two men standing over her. Upon investigating, the
two men(Rathan &amp; Termaine) split up, one of them(Rathan) carrying 
the Sedai away. Another woman(Sharine) was following and apparently
knew the man with the Sedai.  The two said that yet another woman
(identity unknown) channeled, causing injury to the Sedai and
wrapping the man(Rathan).  I suspect that by finding the man
I did not follow(Termaine) we may be able to find the woman
who was channelling against the Lord Dragon's decree.
Be on the watch for this man, as he may be dangerous.

I as you know am Sharine, we didnt mention Termaine by name. So you all won't know what the mans name is, nor do I think, did the said Asha get a good look though I may be wrong.  But that was my impression since Termaine took off and he followed me and the others. Another not, Rathan was -not- dressed as a Gaidin/warder in fact there was nothing about the man to suggest it for those of you in the know. The rest of the decree is valid and to the point, just wanted to add these few little additional tidbits to clear up any mishaps before had.

      <text>As you know (or maybe you didn't know), I play Termiane.  I thought
I'd clear up a few things.  No, Kahlar didn't get a good look at
Termi, but he -is- pretty distinctive.  Prolly the best desc that
could have been gotten is a tall, well-built man wearing all black,
including a glove on his left hand and a faded broad brimmed hat on
his head.  He was wearing a BM-style (katana-style) sword at his left
hip, and his coat had silver lightning strikes on the arms and gold
herons at the collar.  I'm not sure what Naled means by the lightning
bolts being significant (as they are the sigil of a Seanchan House,
Kirin), but they certainly are distinctive.  If anything changes
about Termi's description, I'll note it in his doing (oh, and he
usually doesn't wear a BM-style sword, but rather a SC-sword, so if
the sword isn't mentioned in his doing, he's got the SC-style.

Patrol report:
I, Dedicated Dreq Cypher, was in the Oval plaza in Caemlyn for patrol duty.
As I was standing guard, watching the citizens of Caemlyn on their daily
routines, a Gate snapped into existance just outside of the plaza. I could
not see the flows that made up the Gate, so, presumably, it was woven by
a woman with Saidar. A naked, dirty and wounded woman flew out from the
Gate with tremendous force, and if I were not there to catch the woman
with flows of air, she might have died from the impact of hitting the
ground. As I was tending her, she began to struggle, as if she were mad,
or terribly afraid of something or someone. As I was pondering about the
condition of the woman, an invisible -something- hit me square in the chest,
knocking the air out of my lungs. I noticed that my skin was tingling at
the time, signaling that a woman as seizing Saidar. I guessed it to be the
woman, as she flew out of a Gate and all, so I shielded her. Seeing no
other alternative, I brought her to the Farm and placed her in the jail,
so that she may be questioned later.

  I have come to notice a lack in training occuring around the
Black Tower recently.  This will change.  Every man who's name is on the
rolls must push himself at every turn, and not allow himself to grow lax.

  Too many of you seem to be losing focus.  To this end I will be having
the level of training stepped up.  Also, I will be working one on one
with some of the more advanced students to further increase their
abilities.

  I expect to see the Black Tower become a force to be recokend with.
A name to make rulers tremble.  This will not happen unless each man here
dedicates himself fully to this end.

come across a channeler.  I'm not sure of his attributes,
nor am I sure that he is trained, he very well may be a wilder.
When I was engaged in conversation with one of the occupants,
someone fell off a chair, and I quickly glanced over, I discerned
several airflows, and felt the menacing aura come from about him.
However, I neither recognized him, nor saw a black coat.  This
is a warning.  Someone in caemlyn is either a wilder or a trained
channeler.  Excercise due caution.

During a patrol in Caemlyn, Soldier Adara, Soldier al'Hael, and myself happened
across a rather distasteful woman in a red dress singing lewd songs in the oval
Plaza.  She slipped in a few verses that were rather degrading towards the
Asha'man, and so I took the paper she was writing her song on in flows of Air
and tossed it out of her hands onto the floor.  She embraced Saidar, and so I
instructed Soldier al'Hael to Shield her, and Soldier Adara to bind her, in
case she could possibly pose a danger to us or any of the citizens around.  As
I did so, a seemingly young woman stepped out of the crowd and demanded I
release the woman in red to her.  Naturally, I refused, and she too embraced
Saidar.  I attempted to shield her twice, and each time, she sliced my flows.
Wishing to end the confrontation quickly, I wove a weak club of Air at her, and
accomplished my goal of knocking her unconcious.  Unfortunately for her, I was
unable to catch her as she fell, as I was distracted by the woman in red.  Who
was struggling against the bonds of Air, as well as the Shield that soldier
al'Hael was maintaining on her.  The woman I had just knocked out fell to the
ground and hit her head rather hard on the floor, causing some moderate
bleeding.  As I was attempting to Heal her, the woman in red managed to break
soldier al'Hael's shield, but he quickly weaved another one.  I saw that I
would be unable to Heal the damage the fall had done to the unconscious woman,
and so I gave the order to release A'lyse, the woman in red.  I carried the
unconscious woman to the Golden Bowl Inn, where I promptly Travelled to the
farm, taking her with me so she could recover and heal.  I am currently keeping
watch over her, but I believe I will transfer that duty to someone else soon.

While on duty in the Golden Bowl, suspision arose about a locked door.
I heard scuffling, and attempted to enter the room.  It was locked.
I then felt channeling on the other side.  I knew assumed that the man
channeling was not Asha'man, so I attempted to break through the door.
I met with an unknown resistance, what it was woven with is not known.
I attempted to break through again, this time with the assistance of another
Asha'man.  We were overcoming the resistance when the room erupted into
an inferno.  Protecting the citizens that were in the room became my 
first priority, while the Asha'man battled the fire.  When it was contained
we saw no signs of the person or persons that previously occupied the 
room.

early in the afternoon in the Half Moon Inn, when its proprietor and
another gentlemen presuming to be some Andoran Lord (desc of Dhaeran and
Slayn respectively) entered.

This Andoran Lord albeit outright ordered Flhad to go away with him to
some undisclosed location for a 'talk', finding it neccessary to have
two of the Queens Guard in attendance.

I didn't know the Asha'man were subject at all to anyone but the Lord
Dragon.......   and suffice it to say, Dedicated Modanran has not returned

The Lord Lt. that came into the Inn was upset, and looking for councel.
His attitude towards me is for me to deal with.  As it stands now, he

      <text>Soldier Vash and myself were on the streets of Caemlyn today.
Vash got a little excited at the sight of a pretty girl, and in the 
process, scared her off the edge of the fountain into the water.
We offered our assistance in getting her to food and warmth, but
after a brief conversation she became suspicious of our intentions.

As her fear of us grew, she manifested the ability to channel. It was
only a shove to keep us away, and only happpened as her distress
increased. I do not think she has full control of her ability, and I
also did not think her harmless enough to leave in the city.

Her name is Kithra, and we have brought her here in the hopes that
something may be done to help her. Her personal reaction to her own
channeling is one of terror, and if not taught control, I fear what
might happen.
Speak to her, but with a friendly tone, and a mind to caution. We
will await the word of the M'Hael before taking further action.

First Dedicated Rassmussen Aldaar

&amp;r*OOC note*&amp;n
We didn't make like we saw flows or anything... we felt someone
channel more than once, and she was the only person present, or
likely to be responsible.
We didn't finish the RP to bring her here, but that was where it
was leading.
Hopefully someone else will be able to follow up on this if I don't

      <text>While on a routine patrol of Caemlyn, I decided to quench my thirst at a
local inn, The Half Moon Inn, as i recall.  I was idly drinking my ale as
a young man entered, he wasn't very much different from most of the
citizens as he ordered his drink but I kept my eye on him just in case.  
I got up to talk to the patrons at the Inn and while I was doing so, he
suddenly grasped Saidin.  I grasped through self-defense, but soon found
that there was no particular threat and then i acknowledge him.  As we
talked I found out his name is Kangin Verrac, he was somewhat terrified at
the moment but after I released he calmed down and let go of the Power.  
I decided that placing a shield on him would be in everyone's best
interest, he was very cooperative and I detained him in one of the rooms.
I did not bring him to the Farm due to my inability to Travel, so I
awaiting orders of what to do with him.

I went into the Half Moon Inn to get a drink before heading back to the farm. About half way through a young man came in, noteably tipsy, and upon later discovery rather drunk. Some events unfolded that resulted in me telling him to more or less sit down before I was forced to do something drastic. Still drunk he only laughed which caused me to pick him up and help him to his chair..with a bit of force. When I did this he, to my great surprise, grasped saidin and lashed out at me. I shielded him quickly and after a small coversation he agreed to come to the Black Tower.

Today Asha'man Ba'Shan, Asha'man al'Mer, Dedicated Caballein, and Myself cornered and captured the traitor Soldier Gerschwyn. He was recaptured, taken back, and hung at the Traitors Tree. I encourage all to look at his corpse to find a true example of what happens to those that betray the Black Tower.
You will notice that he has no feet, well, not really anyways, as we had to melt them off for him to stop running. Also before being captured we servered him from Saidin. While being hung he decided to, with his last ragged words, insult me. That is why he has a gaping hole in the middle of his torso, I decided that would suit him. This will continue to happen and consequences -will- become more severe if any more people decide to betray the Black Tower.

Today, while I, Dedicated Cypher, was patrolling in the Oval, I found a woman channeling. I asked the woman her name, and she lied, as I later found out. She told me she was registered, but under a false name, if in fact she is registered at all. My efforts to prosecute her were rebuffed by the Captain General of Andor. This is unacceptable. The woman, Taisha or Renla- those were the two names she gave to me- was clearly violating the law and making a mockery of the Lord Dragon's generosity extended towards female channelers. Yet I could do nothing, because of the Captain General, who was obviously biased, as he was seemingly friends with a girl being escorted by the woman. I also identified the girl as a suspect wanted in connection with a murder. This corruption in the one of the highest ranks of office in Andor should not go unpunished, but I, being nothing but the Lord Dragon's loyal 'weapon', cannot do a thing about it.

Word has reached me of something very dire. Today I am giving instructions on what will be done about it. The Rebel Tower has made the decision to sever all ties from out own army. The have made some poor and weak claim about why. Its matters little why. The fact is that they have done it. From this point on ALL Rebel Aes Sedai, their warders, their children, etc. are to be captured and imprisoned upon sight if they are found on the premises. It is too be done as cleanly is possible, but if they resist, use the appropriate actions to subdue and capture them. When any person or persons of this nature are taken, you WILL report them to me immediately. They will be dealed with by me, and by me only, unless I have given a letter, or notice saying another person has the authority to see to their imprisonment.
Any trespasser found or seen is to be killed. No exceptions. The farm is to be locked down tighter than ever. No one enters, unless they are being brought in by a Soldier, Dedicated, or Asha'man. And absolutely no one leaves. The patrols are to be reassigned and sentries and patrols of watches are to be assigned to the farm. All patrols in Caemlyn are from here on out doubled. You will be ready for anything. If an Aes Sedai is known to be from the Rebel Tower and is causing any trouble, deal with her appropriatly. Take them to the Queens Guard and let them figure out what to do unless you are instrucvted otherwise by either myself or The Lord Dragon Reborn, Rand al'Thor.

*OOC note: Things are gonna be done a little differently, at leats for awhile.

This is a great chance for some new RP you guys, and a chance to get to know some of the members of this guild OOCly as well as ICly. I'd also like to get some of our members, especially the lower ranked ones who cannot leave the farm yet, some Rp in so they get better. And of course, whenever I'm invloved in something big, and you cooperate and make the RP easier and such, promotions or the amount of RP with me for a promotion is ticked away. So, be around have fun, etc. :)*

They go when sent by the M'Hael or the Lord Dragon. True, these are 
inactive at the moment. More importantly, the Shadow GLs and BT GLs were
not asked or informed. Until this can be straightened out, the M'Hael will
not give permission to send a strike unit.

      <text>*in a rough hand on a scrap of dirty parchment*

Dedicated Devrasii was guiding some Soldiers through the basics of
attack weaves when all of a sudden he turned and ran from the field
screaming something about payback.  The last anyone saw he had made
a gateway and ran through it, still screaming.

No one has seen Dedicated Devrasii since, nor do they know what
happened to him that day in the field.  He had recently returned
from Cairhein on unnamed business.

If anyone finds Dedicated Devrasii, living or dead, they are to bring
word of it to the M'Hael.

      <text>Three, actually.
While away from the farm one day with his bond, Etaine, and her Gaidin,
Jerek, the taint overcame Doran.  The landscape around the three suffered
far less damage than they did, however, the burnt trees give proof to
his madness.  The earth in the area where the three bodies were found
was uprooted and disturbed greatly, and the trees are but a charred stick.
The bodies of the three were grossly burned, and it appeared almost as
though Doran himself burned from the inside out.  Etaine and Jerek are
only slightly less scarred, and their deaths may be caused by the cascade
of bondloss that would occur in this situation, but it is uncertain to
know for sure.

The loss of Dedicated Doran al'Kira, Aes Sedai Etaine al'Caar Teyvara,
and Gaidin Jerek Teyvara will be a mourned by the Dedicated and Aes Sedai's
hometown of Deven Ride.

      <text>A messenger arrived from Ghealdan bearing the following message:

Cheron Katranna, the barmaid from the Golden Bowl, has died at the hands
of the Seanchan in Amadicia.  She had been visiting her hometown of Sehar
in Ghealdan, and crossed into Amadicia around the time of the invasion.
Her escort, Captain Vlemar Ratelin of the Queen's Guard, accompanied her
there, where both met up with the Seanchan forces.  He was able to bring
her back to Sehar where they both died of their injuries.  Before she 
breathed her last, she requested that the necklace she wore, her family
heirloom, be given to Asha'man Ragnar Karde.  She said he would know what
to do with it.

*he also bears the necklace, to be given to the Baijan'm'hael*

      <text>A fool recruit decided to attack his teacher today, wich resulted in
a nice display for the people near the training grounds. 
Some say they might set up a play during cristmas to display the story 
of the silly sailor trying to fight goliath, or in this case Colbey.

Anyway, Boat Captain Santos was casually wrapped and slapped and 
walked off after giving our friendly neighbourhood drill sergeant Colbey
a dark look. It seems that Colbey scored another member for his fanclub.

Later that day Santos has been seen tending to some severe bruises on his
elbows and knees, which he probably got during his little intermezzo with
Colbey.
