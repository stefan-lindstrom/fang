      <text>I'm so proud! Activity!

As well as congratulating you on this, I also wanted to post a note about
what is up with those funky imm titles. Or actually, why so many and why
-here-. So.. here's the deal.

Alani is taking up the group for Female Channeling. Leyshal is going to be
working with Foreign Lands. Therefore, they're both here and they're both
watching out for you. They are the Group Leaders for the SC and will be
working together for the guild.

With those changes, we also have a Mortal Guild Leader position open here
within the Seanchan. This is the actual Guild Leader as the immortals work
with the groups and have a very broad activity range. I'm looking for a
person that is intelligent, very bookish in ideals, and wants the chance
to work with two great imms and a whole mess of active guildies. If you're
the right person, mail me your app.

Have fun!

      <text>Check 'seeking 12' from time to time to see who's seeking the guild and
whose backgrounds have been authorized and which have not.  Then, when you
see one of them come online, RP with them!  It doesn't have to be char
affecting, just see that they can RP with some decency, and that they have
at least a basic knowledge of how a Seanchan should behave.  I'll try my
best to keep up postings on the board about new seekers and what their
roles will be so they can RP accordingly, but it slips my mind
occasionally.    

Also, with sponsoring, I'd -really- like to see you actually doing an RP, 
rather than just talking to them and deciding through osays that they'll be
a good candidate for the guild.  This means I expect to see a log of it.  I 
can't award you for it if I don't see the log.

I know there's been a few of you who have sponsored people fairly blindly,
on the judgment saying &quot;Oh hey, they're a friend of mine, so I'll sponsor
them.&quot;  Please don't let that be your deciding factor.  Even if you've RP'd
with them on an alt, you still should be RPing with them in a seeking process
for the purpose of seeing that they can play a Seanchan.  And if they have 
trouble, you should be helping them out with it.  The seeking process is there
to get people up to date with the goings on in the guild so that they're not
joining blindly.  Make sure they don't stumble into the guild because they're
merely a friend, only to discover that they chose a role they really don't
like playing.  It's easier on everyone if they can find their niche before
they're actually guilded.

Also, please don't sponsor your own alts.  I have enough trouble keeping track
of my own alts, let alone all of yours.  I look typically for 2 sponsors per
seeker, and with 30+ of you, that shouldn't be so hard to get.  Sponsoring
your own alt only serves to confuse me and everyone else who checks out the
seeking command.  If they see 2 names listed there, they'll think, well hey
they already got both sponsors.  They don't need another, and why hasn't Lesh
guilded them yet?

Confusing. So please, no sponsoring of your own alts.  Those of you who
currently have your names next to your seeking alt, please remove it.

      <text>Hey, I've had some rather serious medical problems RL which has made my presence here so hit and miss. I just wanted to let everyone know that if you don't see me for a few days, a week or something, it is due to that and not else. Somedays I am able to be online and feel fine, other days I am not and in the last few weeks or so I've not been here much. With luck and stuff I'll be feeling better soon and we'll go from there. Tami player of Jessa and others.

      <text>Gant wrote up the information on the invasion today. I put it in a temp
helpfile titled &quot;scinvasion&quot;. Once it's no longer an issue then I will
remove it but it has good information detailing who was where when it
happened including a note on numbers and divisions.

      <text>If you haven't already read the log of the meeting (or attended the meeting),
let me catch you up to date really quickly.

I've resigned as the Foreign Lands Imm.  As of Monday, Lyeshal will be no
more.  But, like the phoenix rising from the ashes, there will be rebirth!
I'll be creating a new alt, Lynriala, who will become the MGL of Seanchan.
Yes, I'm staying around.

But *gasp*  what about Zoya?  She's the MGL!  Have no fear, my buggies, 
Zoya will be here, too.  Except she's moving up to be the Foreign Lands
Imm.

I don't have a name yet for her, you'll have to ask her when you see her.
But, we're pretty much swapping positions.  I am taking on the duties of 
MGL, and she is taking on the duties of IGL.

So, this is likely my last post as Lyeshal.  Here's my updated contact
info for you (please update your contact lists):
Email: lynriala@hotmail.com
AIM: Lynriala

The others remain the same.

      <text>Work Ethics, 
If it costs the business money with no return profit, it's forbidden.
If it costs the business money and has meager profit, it's forbidden.
If you enjoy doing it while at work, it's forbidden.
If you don't enjoy doing it, chances are it's your job.
Small fish in a giant fish bowl get eaten first.
Big fish in a giant fish bowl have been known to choke on small fish.

Either way, we're all in the fish bowl, just hope I'm a poisonous, 
barbed little fish, who manages to escape the ever consuming 
big fish.

Kudos.

      <text>So now that everyone has had time to get their roleplay up to date, I'd
like to ask that you guys send me a little mudmail.  It just needs to let
me know where you guys are ic'ly since you now have two more locations in
which you can rp in.
