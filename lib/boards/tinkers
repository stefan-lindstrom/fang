      <text>Any roleplay logs that are sent to me via email or mudmail will gain you 
questpoints. There is a base award of five per log, with the opportunity to 
gain more by showing an honest effort to produce interesting situations. 
Good emotes are always rewarded, as is effort. Please take me up on the offer.

      <text>A wagon is available to each of you at no cost. If you would like one, I 
need a description for your wagon, color codes included. I also need a long 
description (what is seen when a person 'looks') for the wagon object itself. 
I will get them put in as soon as possible once the descriptions have been 
received. Don't let this offer pass you by.

      <text>This is an exploit, I think, so I provide this information for educational purposes only.  If you 'camp', and then become to an alt, then become back to your tinker (I assume it also works if you log out and log back in), you can move about and your campfire will follow you, so you get the miniscule AC and ABS bonuses while retaining mobility.  Incidently, I think this skill is useless. ;p

      <text>You don't even have to logout to move around with the camp, just camp, sleep and then wake and you are set with a following campfire.

      <text>How about a Cooking skill? It could work like craft but instead you make eddible things that could have HP/Mana bonuses aside from getting rid of hunger.
Just an idea.

      <text>This is just a post to catch you guys up on what's going on. The boards were 
recently cleaned, so if there's information that got removed that you'd like 
to see in ghelp form or whatnot, mail me.

Paige isn't functioning as Homelands Group Leader currently, so that leaves 
myself once again as your leader. If there's anything you need, don't be afraid 
of mailing me about it. The offers in previous posts are still up for grabs, 
so take me up on them.

I believe that's all for now. Questions, comments, or anything else should 
be directed to me via mudmail or email. Thank you.

      <text>There comes a time when we all must move on, when changes are made.  Now
is one of those times.  What this means is that I'm resigning as GL.  Not
a big surprise, yes?  What this doesn't mean is that I'm going to
disappear.  I may not function as your GL any longer, but I'm still
available to talk, to bring ideas, problems, and comments to.  I'm
generally logged in as Alani, so please don't hesitate if you have
something to say.  All that's left to say is that it's been a pleasure
working with all of you.  Just....  Be more active!  *shakes fist*
Er, yeah. Catch you guys later. :)
