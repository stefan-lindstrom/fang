      <text>Ten thousand light Saldaean horse and fifteen thousand foot clothed in blue
coats with red and gold dragons accross the chest stepped into the Square 
of Tammaz seemingly out of thin air.  They fought with men from the Illian 
army for a short time in the streets, but the resistance was suppressed by 
the Council of Nine upon their learning that the attack was orchestrated by 
Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn.  Lord Brend is missing and presumed dead, 
and Mattin Stepaneos disappeared two days before the attack.  The Laurel 
Crown is now worn by the Lord Dragon, placed upon his head by Gregorin den 
Lushenos and the other seven remaining High Lords.  All hail Rand al'Thor, 
King of Illian.
