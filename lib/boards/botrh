      <text>Hey guys, I've a favor I need to ask of you all.

Not sure how many people will actually respond to this but
I need to do it anyways, for my sanity.

I need to know where each of you more active and even semi-
active Bandies actually _are_ ICly.  I'm trying to decipher who's
in Caemlyn and who's in Salidar currently.

I know a couple people that are in Salidar, and any recruit I find
that isn't in Salidar, I wave my magic imm wand &lt;tm&gt; and send
them off to Salidar to the Bandie camp so that they can get
lessons from the few guildies I know that are there, such as Aleus
and Nalesean and of course Mat is there.

I'm trying to work it so that there's only a handful of Bandies in
Caemlyn recruiting, as it was presented to me by Bradlen and
Byzel that it should be this way.  So!  Assuming I get enough
replies on this, there will be an established group of Bandies that
will -always- deal with seekers and sponsor them and then
send them to Salidar where they will actually get into the guild
'officially'.  Basically is you don't want to be restricted to being
in Salidar, then recruiting is more for you, but if you're more
about training recruit and providing in-guild roleplay, then Salidar
is for you.

When I figure out where everyone is, I may decide there needs
to be some balancing (IE: More people here or there).  Realistically
we should only need 3-4 Bandies in Caemlyn, as there only needs
to be two sponsors gained to be guilded (yes I know there's time
zone differences and the like, that's why I said 3-4, probably 4
would be good, with varying times of regular activity.)

I believe that's all.  MUDmail me your locations and/or IC situations.

If I get a good number of replies on this, I would be ever thankful,
it'd make things much more easy for me and the seekers, and not
only that, tighten up our guild a bit.  Make it more organized.

Thanks,

Mas

      <text>Oh yeah, send me roleplay logs, CLEANED, please.

We need some more current logs on the webpage and
now we actually have a competant Webmaster so...

Oh yeah.. bndgoss!  I wanna see more of that.. slackers.

See ghelp for info on bndgoss (guild gossip).  I've set
it on most of you (perm_gossip that is).

Carry on.

      <text>I think you and I are in the same boat as far as frustration
level about the &quot;new gskill project&quot;, I put that in quotes
because I consider it a theoretical idea still, meant to only
tease GLs and guildies.  It's been how many years? :p
     Anyways, I could go on and on and on about this, but
I won't.  Let's just leave it at... I'm not impressed with the
progress in that particular area.

      <text>Hey guys and gals, just letting you know I am more or
less watching the Band once again (previously as Mas)
and I can still disguise as Nalesean should the need arise
to give lessons and so forth.  Talbain is also available for
lessons and we have another Scout, Devan who can also
help out.  He's authorized me to let you know some of
his alts-- Jerek and Rhayn.

I have gone through and edited Ghelp, specifically the ones
pertaining to ranks, tactics and protocol.  Everything should
make a bit more sense now.  I've also added in some new
ranks to correspond with the edited files.

My loose plan is to get recruits to Salidar and train them there
with the bulk of the Band until they reach at least their first
rank.  Once first rank is reached, Bandies have to option to
continue training and advance in ranks or to possibly break
off from the Band to rp in Salidar or even go back to Caemlyn
or wherever you were recruited from.  Basically I don't want
to limit roleplay since the Band is largely hindered by timeline
progression (or lack thereof) and a lack of a player for Mat.

The Ball and Hoop is still serving as a makeshift &quot;recruiter
office&quot; for the Band in Caemlyn.  Just keep in mind that
ICly, the bulk of the Band is in Salidar.

That's about it.  I'm mostly going to try and function as a
lesson bitch and GL in terms of reading BGs and guilding
people/setting ranks, that sort of thing.

Oh yes!  RP logs can be sent to my email which hasn't changed
and is available in Ghelp and contactinfo (I think posted on here
too somewheres).  I will award for good logs and lessons and
all that good stuff.

Let me know if there are any questions, I'm usually here.
MUDmail me if not, or talk to Amarinda too :)

      <text>Now, we all know that Bandies are not warders.  And thusly I refuse to
train anyone like them.  Wanna be a warder, go join their guild.  But, if
you want to learn cool places to hit people and some unique scenarios like
bar room brawling and close quarters, objects in the way, very military
boot camp style hand-to-hand and weapons training then look me up I'll
have you knowing where and how to hurt people thats both fun and
entertaining as soon as I can.    
All I can say besides that is ask anyone who has done a lesson with me, i.e. Fenric or Landon, how much fun learning to hurt people can be.

So untill that's solved I'll only pop in from
work to check up on boards and stuff.

      <text>As seen on the OOC board, there's both an opening and a filled position
here within the Band. The position of Mortal Guild Leader is open and
I would like to encourage any actives to apply *looks around and winces*
for the position. To let you know, the Non-National Group Leader is going
to be Embreth (formly Warder GL). He's going to be on your chans until a
new guild leader is chosen and he's in the process of learning everything
he can about the Band so that he can offer this guild his best support.
However, However! That does not mean that myself and Hartigan are going
to be going anywhere. I know that Hart has always taken an active role
in this guild and likely always will and I also know that many of you have
gone to him when you needed something. Don't feel as if you can't still
spam him.. *whispers - I have it on good authority he LOVES spam!* Um.
Right. You get the idea. Just letting you know what's open and who will
now be around. Carry on.

      <text>Um, right, I suppose the post name kind of summarizes this post quite
well: I'm available for RP mostly always when I'm on.

Irlan

PS. I could RP with alts in Caemlyn or Baerlon too, in addition to Salidar.

      <text>Hihi you lucky drunken bastards. I'd just like to say that I've stepped
into Embreth's shoes, as per my job, to handle stuff for you until such
time as we have a guild leader or a group leader. I believe that Hart
has been keeping his good eye on you so I doubt you need much, however,
if you'd like to come to me about something or need anything while he
isn't here or whatever, feel free to bang down my door, bark up my tree,
however you want to look at it.

If you're interested in a position, give me a mail. You know my mudmail
address, ne?  :)
