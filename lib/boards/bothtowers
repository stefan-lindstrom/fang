      <text>Your friendly RAS MoN here... I ran across something the other day, and
I wanted to point it out, jot it down for the general populous to note
as well. In book 6, there is a very specific and very appopriate reference
to the behavior of Aes Sedai. You all remember Nynaeve's habit of the
incessant braid-tugging, right? Seems harmless enough. Well, this is
what one of the Blue sisters had to say about it (and this happens in
Salidar, as well, so it IS applicable to all) --- Lelaine eyed Nynaeve's
hand on her braid, and she snatched it away. Too many knew about that habit,
a habit she had tried hard to break. But what the Aes Sedai said was &quot;Not
when it impinges on the dignity of Aes Sedai, child. Women who serve Aes
Sedai should show some reserve in public, however silly they are in private.&quot;
There was nothing to be said to that. Nothing safe, anyway.
 
That's RJ's take on it, guys and gals... Straightforward, to the point,
and it covers a multitude of bases. I post this because this applies not
only to Novices and Accepted, but to Aes Sedai. Shawl-wearers aren't just
about ordering people around and acting snooty... It's about dignity,
respect, and the honor of the sisterhood is taken to a personal level.
All Ajahs, all matters, all the time ;)
 
That is all, carry on.
 
Rosabelle, Lio, et al

      <text>It's become slight common practice among some of us to use the sponsorship
rights that you guys have to get people into the guild as quickly as
possible, more often than not without roleplay.  The reason that we have a
seeking process is to discover who really wants to be in the guild and who
needs a bit more work before they join our lovely group.  The point of
this is to stress the importance of talking to seekers, roleplaying, and
being selective on who you sponsor.  If there are doubts in your mind as
to if the person you just roleplayed with has sufficient language skills
and creativity enough to fill the roll that they are looking to be in the
guild...  Take a little more time, talk to them, ask them to roleplay
again.  Don't just throw around sponsorships like they're nothing.    

Our goal here is to be the best we can be as a whole and having fun while we're 
doing that. Expect a little bit more out of seekers and we come closer to that 
goal. Think about it.

Comments, concerns, flames? Mudmail me.

      <text>I am in total agreement with this.  When one sponsors, make sure that you
do the utmost of Rp, to make sure that a) the person wants to be in the
guild for sure and b) that they at least have the rudimentary knowledge it
takes to be in that guild.  And we all know seeking is a very important
aspect of the beggining a person has to be involved with the guild.

      <text>I also agree. When I look at the seeking list, and I see names after
the person, I expect that person to have had most of his/her questions
answered, and at least the basic knowledge of rp. You don't have to
rp with them until they're masters, obviously, but one session should
be enough to tell you whether or not that person is good to go, or
if he/she needs a bit more work before they're ready to be guilded.
Keep in mind that when you sponsor someone, your name is right there for
all the rest of us to see...if you don't think they're ready, work 
with them a bit more before putting your name there.
Anyway, that's all I have to say about that.

      <text>Thats why I just stay away from the lot of them (seekers that is)
I find that works best for me.

      <text>Ok, I find this attitude a bit annoying...You're not the 
first person who says &quot;I won't RP with a Seeker..it's boring...&quot;
Geez...i mean if we didn't have each and every one of us
a seeker at some time...
But after all every one is free to do as he/she chooses, RP
whenever he chooses, but yet....ewww.
For the rest I agree wholeheartedly on the subject of Rping to
the fullest to become a guildie...
Have fun y'all

      <text>I just simply stated I stay away from seekers.  As I think its in their
best interest if my char. stays away from them.  Nothing to do with being
boring or anything like that.  Now if my Aes were to rp with a seeker
then I would be there, other wise I don't go out of my way to look for them
not my job to.  Call me self centered...or just call me a warder...whatever
works for you.

      <text>Hi everyone!
Just thought I would stop by the board for the first time in a long time and
leave a message. I'm back, for a good long time. I'm probably gonna sound like
I'm on an ego trip, but I also wanted to tell you all that I have been offered
a chance to get a book publsihed. I'll let ya'll know when the book is out for
public distribution...(if the publisher really does like it that is).
Thanks to anyone who has by chance come across anything that I wrote long ago
and your badgering me to finish it. I'll talk to ya'll later!

      <text>Please remember that guild equipment is not to be given to other people. Each 
person is given one set when guilded and is expected to keep it. Such eq is 
one of the advantages of joining a guild in the first place, if code stuff 
is what you're really interested in. Thank you in advance for remembering 
this.

      <text>Hey guys :)
I'm excited about all the new guildees. So excited I can barely contain
myself ;) -However- I have a problem. Those of you participating in the
rank exchange program (yay! This is an awesome program. I encourage all
of you to learn more about it, if you haven't already) are sending me
excellent backgrounds. Which is good. What's bad, though, is that the 
only way I know if a brand new character is an alt of yours, is if you
tell me. So, I'd appreciate it if, when you send your background, you
could also send me the name of the alt that's already been guilded. I 
only need one - I don't need a history of every alt you've ever created
in the entire time you've been on Fang!! :) Just one will be dandy. Any
questions, please let me know.
