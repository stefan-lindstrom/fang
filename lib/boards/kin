      <date>0</date>
      <text>.  Guarded - those that have runaway from the Tower, and are being
.             held to be returned. Also people that are taken prisoner
.             by the Kin for whatever reason.
.
.  Patient - People who cannot just be healed, maybe mental patients,
.            and that have been brought to a location where the guild
.            operates where they will be nurtured back to health.
.
.  Apprentice - Once a woman is taken in by the Kin, she begins a
.            training that attempts to emulate the training they had
.            previously received.
.            There are 5 subranks for Apprentices:
.               Apprentice Initiate
.               Apprentice Practiced
.               Apprentice Advanced
.               Apprentice Prepared
.               Apprentice Learned
.            Advancement through these 5 ranks depends on a loose
.            syllabus and active RP with Wise Women and Elders.
.  
.  Trusted - The people who perform 'support' functions within the Kin.
.            This can range anywhere from defense, to spying to being
.            married to a Kinswoman. This role is open to both men and
.            women.
.            Subranks are:
.               Trusted student 
.               Trusted defender
.               Trusted lookout
.               Trusted husband 
.               Trusted crafter
.
.  Wise Woman - Once done with your Apprentice Training, you
.            become a full Wise Woman, and can begin a Healing shop if you
.            so choose. Since the Kin focus a lot on healing weaves, and
.            since many of the Kin were Wise Woman trained in the Ebou Dari
.            tradition, there is an abundance of healers in the Kin. Most
.            Kin know beyond the basics of healing using the One Power.
.            There are 7 subranks for Wise Women to choose from:
.            Scholar    - those who study and wish to learn
bookworms.
.            Philosopher- those who take themselves up with the questions of life.
.            Seeker     - those who spend their time finding runaways and other
.                           girls from the Tower.
.            Healer     - those who heal beyond the normal
.            Protector   - those who choose to protect the Kin and guards its
.                           secrecy.
.            Mediator   - those who wish to spend their time mediating the many
.                           quarrels of their native city of Ebou Dar, as well as
.                           others.
.            Traveler   - those who spend their time in other lands, healing and
.                           gathering information, spending their time on various
.                           causes.
.
.  Mistress of the Runaways - She takes care of those who have run away fr
.            the Tower.
.  Mistress of Herbs - She is responsible for finding and researching herbs
.            as well for the parts of the syllabus that deals with
.            herbs in all its aspects.
.  Mistress of Apprentices - She arranges the lessons and advancement of
.            Apprentices.
.  Mistress of Discipline - For those Apprentices that misbehave.
.  Mistress of Trusted - The one responsible for the people in the trusted rank.
.  Elder   - A rank given to older kinsmembers, showing they have helped and
.            guided the Kin to their best effort. Because of the wisdom that
.            comes with age their advice is highly respected.
.  Eldest - the GL rank :)

      <text>. The seekers for the Kin guild will be split into two groups:
. 
. 1: Seekers that were guilded to either the TAS or the RAS guild...RP wise
.    these are mostly runaways and such. Since they allready have proven to
.    be able to roleplay (by getting into these guilds) they will only need
.    one sponsor. This being the person who finds them.
.
. 2: Seekers that have not been guilded to either the TAS or RAS guild.
.    These seekers need to gain 3 sponsors within 3 weeks time. If they did
.    not get enough sponsors within these three weeks I will talk with
.    them. If they say they did not have 3 sponsor roleplays they will be
.    granted more time and I will urge the members to roleplay with seekers
.    more. If they did have enough roleplay but just didnt get the sponsors
.    then I will tell them that they are not ready to be guilded or
.    something along those lines.
.
. Apart from this:
. All seekers must submit a background history to me before they start
. seeking.

      <text>Hiya,

It has been brought to my attention that some of the AS might know
about the connection of the Kin to the red belt ICly. Personally, I
doubt such a statement, eventho the person that brought it forwards
is, in my eyes, reasonably trustworthy when it comes to this kind of
things.

The red belt, added to that, is the only truly IC piece of equipment
the Kin has...With IC I mean that it can be traced back to the books.
As such, it is a very important piece of equipment. It should also
be noted that the belt wasnt worn -all- the time, but that wise women
were chosen to wear the belt and act out on the responsibilities it
brought with it for a certain amount of time. A job that wasnt very
liked by wise women on average, if I remember correctly. The tasks
of those that are wearing the belt is to provide healing to whomever
needs it, added to that, there were probably also other tasks that
came with it. Examples of these tasks could be, for instance, mediating
between two fighting parties and such. At any rate, in Ebou Dar the
red belt was known, respected and maybe even feared. Outside of Ebou
Dar (and the Rahad) it was hardly known by anyone.

Those of you that do not feel comfortable with wearing the red belt all
of the time icly under these circumstances while you do feel your
equipment has IC bearing might consider doing the same trick as many
of the AS do: writing a small statement underneath their desc telling
players under what circumstances the red belt should be considered to
be IC.

      <text>I figured I'd make a small, quick statement about the guarded rank and
also about the patient rank. These two ranks are mostly intended for
people that are new to the guild or that might be guilded here for a short
period of time. As such, they will not always be aware of the Kin. It might
not even always be the best idea to inform them about the ic existance
of the Kin. As such, keep this in mind when RP-ing with guarded and patient
ranks and use your personal judgement on what you will be telling and wonr
be telling this person ICly.

      <text>In the books the Kin exists for the larger part of Novices and Accepted,
some of these Novices and Accepted ran away from the Tower while others
might have been kicked out.

If any of you happen to be approached by a runaway Novice (or Accepted)
then you should inform OOCly if they wish to be returned to the Tower or
if they would like to join the Kin. This is a choice that they only can
make. Either way, it will be good for Kin RP...

If they wish to be returned to the Tower, however, then it might be best
for you to NPC another wisewoman to prevent yourself from being ICly
exposed.

In addition, for the moment it is more realistic for the Kin to deliver
any and all runaways to the Tower rather then to Salidar, seeying there
havent been any real indepth IC contacts between Salidar and the Kin.

If you have any questions about this, please contact me...I myself am
a bit boggled that I wrote this but at the same time, it seems to be
good to have written this down.

      <text>Ummm...if they wish to join the Kin, then make sure that they have
contacted me and have given me a background of their character, before
this is done they will simply not be put into the Kin.

      <text>I just reread my last post on the guarded rank and came to the conclusion
that it might be mistaken for a reason not to RP with one in the ranks
Guarded or Patient. Nothing is less true. What I ment is that you should
ofcourse RP with people in these ranks, but keep in mind that the Kin
might stay a secret for them for some time to come.

What it comes down to really is that the person(s) responsible for
bringing the Guarded or Patient within the ranks of the Kin is primarily
responsible for what the guarded/patient is told about the IC existance
of the Kin. This, because she will know the situation better then anyone
else involved.

      <text>During the day, the orphanage's corridors usually stood quiet 
and empty.  This particular afternoon passed in languorous 
idleness, silence indoors broken only by the distant, muted 
sounds of children playing in the sunshine.  
Then, into this den of tranquillity, scampered two figures.  
Sticking to the shadows, the clandestine figures -skulked-, 
emitting hushed scheming whispers.  The taller figure, 
obviously the leader, held a tiny pot in one hand, and her 
friends hand in the other.
All was well until the smaller figure, quite obviously one 
of the orphanage's children, tripped, letting out a soft 
yelp and a whispered, 'Are you sure this is a good idea, Daene?' 
The older woman nodded, but couldn't stall a tittering laugh.  
Catastrophe followed mishap; as Daene lifted one hand to stifle 
her giggles, there was a poof dust from the container - Pepper!  
Daene sneezed violently, and her co-conspirator giggled, 
wrinkling her (unbelievably) cute nose as the powder sifted 
down through the air.  Decorum vanished as the two struggled 
through a fit of giggling.. yet when Daene finally sobered, 
they continued on through the corridor, towards a particular 
guardsman's room.  Daene led, unerring - as though perhaps she'd 
been here before, or had followed someone here - and they stole 
quietly into Bradden's bedroom.
Pouncing into action, Daene flung back the sheets and liberally 
dosed the bed in the offending pepper, carefully making sure that 
there wasn't enough to leave smudges, but certainly enough to make 
sleep impossible.  Daene winked at her shorter (and very very 
adorable) companion, and deftly remade the bed.
Then, as if that wasn't mischief enough, nimble fingers slipped a 
note from some hidden pocket and tucked it, out of sight, under the 
mans pillow - and wearing a decidedly pleased smirk, Daene let her 
young friend drag her from the room.   


*OOC*  You'll notice I didn't exactly say who the girl was.
I'm sure somebody will work it out...

      <text>Hiya, 

Well as you know I been looking for a GL for your guild...BUT it seems
only -1- of ya have applied...But I'll do my best to find a GL that will
Help you and work to make your guild the best it can be.  But unfortunitly
it takes time...and people.  I can get the best GL for you, but the GL
cannot make you rp, nor play.  So...you need to help the GL out by being 
here and helping run the guild, because without you there is -no- guild:)

I will keep you all updated on the process:)  Till then keep catching
those run away novices!

Thank you,
Valkeria

      <text>Righty, I can't make the meeting (GMT sucks, I know), but I'd been 
working with Laran on some things.  With the change of admin.. well, 
I'll open the ideas here and you guys can argue over them.
&amp;WActivity/Members&amp;n
We -cannot- get more members until we have an active rp area.
At the last meeting, we talked about either refinding the orphanage,
and getting it put back in, or rebuilding it.  Likewise, the Kin farm
that was to be based just outside of Caemlyn.  I've built most of 
the farm already, mapped it and desc'd it, so all that needs done 
is to get it in place.  

A while ago Cait mentioned getting some Kinnies into Houses, as
teachers, healers, etc.  I know they aren't the most active guild
on the mud, but could we bug them about it?
Oh, oh the orphanage side again.. once its in place, how about
we mention it on the OOC board, and post that all children char's
are welcome to both play there, and be guilded to the Kin as
'Orphan' or even just 'Child'.  Obviously we'd have to make joining
worth something.. like some kind of skill, and of course g.eq.  
Look at it this way, they could also use the fact that if they get
trouble they could do a runner to the orphanage - and NPC (within
reason) one of the Kinnies taking care of them.

&amp;WSyllabus&amp;n  (for channelers, anway)
How about taking after one of the *cough* other guilds on this one.
Get the actual -content- of the lectures writen down, on the web
somewhere we can all get to.  An IC section, on what should be known,
hints on rp'ing it and stuff, and an OOC section for any other details.
I've got examples of this waiting to go, if anybody wants to see what 
I mean.
Obviously, you -cannot- teach somebody how to rp channeling by just
letting them read a file, then giving them rank.  If channeling lessons
are taught this way, the student would have to be tested - either somebody
of higher rank actually testing them, or using other chars/npc'ing 
situations to test them.  Want an example?  Due to a lack of teachers,
I learn all I need to know about weave healing from the file.  Then
the GL, or anybody of a decent enough higher rank, rp's out a situation
whereby they -need- healing, either as themselves or using an alt, or 
whatever.  If I rp it out well enough, doing everything right, its assumed
that I know what I'm doing, and pass the lecture/lesson.
So many things could be done this way - and if its done wrong?  THEN
I'd get taught how to do it, shown ic'ly or ooc'ly what I did wrong
and how to impove it.  Its just plain silly having people that know
perfectly well what they are doing resit all these lessons and lectures
when we lack the members to teach them.  We HAVE experience, so why not 
use it to our advantage??
I'm sure you can see how almost all channeler lectures could be done
this way, if the file's were writen up correctly.
Full examples on demand.

      <text>Joram pulled himself up onto the next tree branch and smiled triumphantly.  He
had done it.  He had climbed higher than any of the other children at the
Orphanage.  Settling himself on the branch, he looked up at the sun and closed
his eyes, letting the warm light wash over him.  Suddenly, a loud cracking
noise caused his youthful eyes to open, and the last thing he saw as the branch
broke out from underneath him, was the ground rushing up at him.  He shrieked
for a moment before hitting the ground.  Blackness engulfed him.  His ear
suddenly perked up as he rounded the corner of the building nearest the garden.
Eyes wide, he bolted toward the shriek.  Upon reaching the scene, he gasped in
shock.  Laying there upon the ground, was Joram, his left arm bent at an odd
angle behind his back.  Unmoving, Bradden thought the boy dead, and this
opinion wasd enforced more by the shock he was in, which would not allow him to
hear the soft breathing of the unconcious youth.  Throwing his head back, he
howled in fury and sadness.  Thoughts were running through his head, unsortable
in their extremity.  Why hadn't he gotten there sooner?  Why had he not been
watching the children better?  Why?  Why?  Why?  As several other guards and a
couple of the women working at the Orphanage showed up, Bradden turned his gaze
upon them, lost in his grief and rage.  With a snarl, he turned and bolted.  
Reaching the wall with the guards in pursuit, he leapt, catching the edge.  
Climbing over, he dropped to the ground and ran, heading for the south.

      <text>She didn't sleep well, that night.  

She never did, really, but that night it seemed somehow worse,
somehow more lonely, knowing He wasn't there.  Reliving 
everything she'd said, everything she'd done to him.. 
everything she'd denied him.  It was almost physical, that 
ache, and eventually she rose, started pacing the room - 
His room, although he hadn't been there for hours.  
At first light, she left the orphanage.. set out on the 
streets, just wandering, searching, maybe getting lost, 
then refinding herself.  For hours she simply wandered - 
until she found, at the end of a rather dirty little lane,
a man.  
One of the old men watching from nearby overheard
only a little of the conversation - she seemed to know 
this man, or think she did, and accuse him of something,
going so far as to even draw her belt knife on him!
  
What happened next was confused.. the rumours ran in so 
many directions that nobody really seemed to know had gone 
on - simply that the ground around the man exploded, the 
earth erupting and stones and rocks flying.  
The woman was seen leaving, dark hair matted against her 
skull with blood, and a rather confused expression on 
her face.   


***  Log on demand.  And no, Daene isn't dead.  She simply has no idea who she is, who anybody else is, or even where she is.  And she's a much happier person for it  *grin*  if anybody's looking, she can be found at Inn's around the city, performing her art ***

      <text>Lost in her internal despair, fluxuating from blackest lows to a almost livable presence, Byranna haunts the streets of Caemlyn at all hours of days and night. (Probably to laretheans dismay )Taking risks but not caring, there is something so sad about the woman, its a aura that extrudes from her. When the orphanage burned she was out wandering, only to come back and find the place in flames, what ever it is that she saw in the flickering and hungry fire only she shall know. Yet from that day she has dissapeared into the city, last seen running like demons were on her heels.

      <text>Right, I'm at the stage where I need to know who wants rooms at the Kin
Farm...  If you want them, that is?  If you want to desc' the room
yourself, that's fine by me, mail away, if not you could just drop me a
mail with outlines, or things that you'd like included, and I'll see to it
asap.  If the free rooms aren't filled by the time the farm's ready to be
linked up here, I'll put in basic descriptions that should suit for now at
least, and the offer of rooms will stand for well, until everybody has a
room where they want one.

      <text>Yes, we have one, you might have noticed that you no longer recall to the
really nasty building in Ebou Dar!  IC'lly, this place is several rooms
north along the western road out of Caemlyn, roughly what would be a day's
ride.  The guard mob will stop anybody non-kin from opening the gate, but
if you want to bring a non-kinnie here, all you need to do is open the
gate for them.  *grin*

Any questions/comments, either post or mail me, and I'll do
what I can to fix anything that's broken.  And the rooms
are pretty basic for a reason - they're open for rent :)

      <text>Hola Kin.

I wanted to write you a note and let you know that come changes have
been made recently. Immediately, Cappen is going to be the GL for the
White Tower. Since Daene is leaving, it was decided that we should do
what we can to distribute the proper resources. Cappen's abilites lead
him to the White Tower, while mine lead me here. I am going to be 
attempting to fill his shoes both here and in Salidar. They are terribly
big shoes, but I will give it my all.

I know this is strange, it seems like no time has passed since Cappen
came to be your IMM GL. However, I do look forward to the future with
you guys and I think that this could be a great guild. I'll post more
later about ideas. If you have any questions or problems, even mild
concerns, mudmail me or send me a tell. I've got contactinfo set up
and you can Email me if you are more comfortable with that.

See you all very soon.

      <text>Hola guild. I wanted to drop a quick note and ask that you welcome
Krisa to her new position of Mistress of the Orphanage. As soon as it
is in place, the positon will be IC but until then, it isn't. Krisa
is a very strong player and very capable of all the duties that this
new job will demand. She's intelligent, good at what she does, and she
cares a great deal for the guild.

Be sure to congratulate her in the upcoming days when you see her.

Since I am the person who made the decision on that skill, allow me to
share my thinking on it. The Kin are failed novices and accepted. Some
failed because they lacked the necessary strength in the One Power, some
because they refused to go through the testing ter'angreal, and some for
severely breaking rules. In the Sedai guilds, the teach skill is only
given to Sedai, not to Accepted or Novices. Thus, for gskills the Kin has
what Accepted and Novices would have, as well as the herb knowledge they
gain to carry out their guise as wise women. What this means is that
although you do not have teach, you do have stormshield.

Amarinda and I have been discussing this guild a bit lately and how it
fits in with the MUD. This prompted us to look at the guildinfo and be
quite honestly dumbfounded. Considering the membership numbers of the Kin
in the books, it is ... well, ludicrous to assume that every last blasted
one of them had a strong affinity for Healing. In fact, I'd surmise that
the reason the Wise Women use herbs is as much because a lot of them need
them as it is to help with their disguise. I realize that some allowances
have to be made because this is a MUD and not the books, but when the
entire guild is supposed to be composed of failed novices and accepted and
perhaps 3 or 4 of the members are the only ones who fit that bill, something
is a bit wrong. Some of the ranks are really curious. Instructor, for
example. I'm also really confused about why warders and aes sedai are
guilded here, too.

Expect changes.

      <text>We are in the middle of change. Krisa and I are going to need to speak
with all of you when you log in next so please send us tells. I'll give
you a brief rundown of what we are doing, but most is going to depend on
you and what you choose to do with your characters.

Right now, the novice book in the Rebel Tower is open, due to a decision
made by the Amyrlin, Egwene al'Vere. She wants all channelers to be
associated with the Tower directly. This doesn't mean that -anyone- can
become Aes Sedai, but if you channel, she wants to know and wants you
around. What this is coming down to OOC, is a merger between Kin and the
Rebels. We are going to be shifting the Kin guild into the Rebels, more
or less. ICly, they know you are here and know what you are about. A note
has been sent to Krisa from the Hall of Sitters asking her to come and
speak with them. If everything goes well, we should be able to guild you
to the Rebels with some changes to EQ and such depending on what you do
with your characters, give you a rank, all that jazz. Once the changes
are in place, then you'll be ranked in the Rebels and the ranking with
the stand along Kin guild will dissolve. You'll be the same, with a
guild, but not this one specifically.

There is low membership, in case you hadn't noticed, and a lot of things
have happened or certain things put in place that aren't exactly what the
Kin were in the books. We're going to try and change that, restructure,
look over, and evaluate how things should be handled. We aren't deguilding
you and leaving you without, just merging.

If you can, please talk with either myself or with Krisa about what you
want to do and the latest developments. Get ready for the strings to your
ankles and wrists that Aes Sedai can provide.  *grin*

Have some fun with it. Maybe it will help numbers and RP situations.

      <text>Allright everyone As most of us have moved to the orphanage to work there
Ainge has offered to give each PC there own room. Provided you mail her a
desc and what objects you want in it. The objects must be the kind to stay
in the room. We will also be getting a playfround and some classrooms. If you
think of anything else let me know so I can give a final list to her.
