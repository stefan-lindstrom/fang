      <text>Remember back in the day... how our website had player
generated maps of zones posted on it?  Well those days
are back!  Yaaa-aaay.  *waves flag*
If you feel like it, it's worth 10 QPs to ya to make and then
submit complete maps of zones to our man Zohar.  He'll
post them.  Be sure to check the website since there's a
half dozen or so maps already up there that were salvaged
from the old site.  So pick a zone not already covered.

Map a zone, submit to Zohar, earn QP.  Simplicity :)

That is all.

      <text>I'll try to be as brief as possible. Riiight. *sagenod*
I'm in the process of making changes to guild administration. All guilds,
both large and small, are being worked with. Here's the game plan:

The guilds are divided up into six different groupings. Each group can be
seen as the opposite of another. I am working with Female Canneling and
Male Channeling, Home Lands and Foreign Lands, then Non-National Armies
and the Shadow. Now.. the reason this can be done and the most important
part of this.

The immortal GLs, as you have seen, are sporting new titles and most all
have the &quot;IMMORTAL&quot; pretitle. This is because they are no longer what we
have considered 'GLs'. They have become Group Leaders. A Group Leader is
an immortal that handles a specific aspect of the guilds (see groups that
I listed). They are responsible for supervising their area and performing
imm tasks that the guild needs. They are also the guys with disguise and
echo that bring you quests. They are going to be out and about and taking
an active interest in their area, be it doing things that have long been
needing done, say within the small guilds, or asking you about plots or
plans. What happened to the Guild Leader position, though?

Guild Leaders are now entirely mortal positions. We've always had our
Mort GLs or MGLs, but they've never been the actual leader except where
the imm position was vacant. Well, things change, and now they are. In
most policies and procedures and IC lives, the immortal will have the
final say but I will no longer be hiring an immortal to lead one guild.

There is one exception to this and that is Shadow. Within the Shadow and
considering the unique way that it runs, a Mort GL will not be hired. We
have Shai'tan and who wants to face that?

So, I'm going to be putting in a helpfile tonight on what I want in an
application. Before the helpfile (I will post once it's complete) look
at the previous posts by myself and Hartigan. We need Morts to GL all
the guilds. I will also be updating wizlist tonight so that you can see
who is running what department without me listing here. I do ask that
you be patient with us as this new system will have bugs, like any other.

Was that short and sweet? Hmm. Tackle me with questions. :)

      <text>Well neither of these guilds have been overly active but with the change
in the storyline recently, we would like to change that a bit.  So as of
right now and until further notice, the sponsorship for these two guilds
has been waived.  All that is needed is a decent background and a copy of
one roleplay log to show that you can rp effectively.  Ranks will be
worked out on a case to case basis, just keep in mind that not everyone
can be a Windfinder or Mistress of Ship.

      <text>
Realism:
This is pretty straightforward. A contestant who does things that are not
physically possible, even with a trampoline, stunt doubles and a crack film
editor, will score low. A person whose emotes seem very feasible will score
high.

Clarity:
This is how easy it is for the reader (i.e. the judge) to understand the
emote. If the judge ends up having no idea what the emoter is attempting to
do, that emoter will score low. If the judge can read through the emotes
quickly and get a good picture of what is going on in one pass, the emoter
will score high.

Strategy:
This is the ability to actually win a fight while staying within the boundary of
realism. Working your opponent into positions where they cannot avoid your hits
and coming up with non-superman ways to avoid taking hits of your own are the
best ways to score high. Doing unrealistic things in order to score hits or
avoid taking them will just detract from the realism score, not boost the
strategy score.

Style:
Note that this is not called &quot;flair.&quot; It is, however, a hard category to
quantify. A consistant voice that makes it easy to identify the emoter is one
thing that will be looked for. Not quirks or ticks, but a distinctive voice
and combat style. This is also the catch-all category for things such as
whether or not the spar flows as RP (yes, a tournament spar is still RP), is
interesting, whether the combatants stay in character, etc. The whole is often
greater than the sum of the parts. This category is a way for the judges to
score on the whole.

And that's it. Direct any questions to me through tells or mudmail. As I
composed this while posting it, I'm sure I typo'd something or left something
unexplained that was obvious to myself but not to those outside my little
corner of insanity.

      <authorname>Tzeentch</authorname>
      <text>For those of you curious about the recent sitebannings, the reasons were
fairly simple. After ranting and raving and trying to get someone else
sitebanned for personality conflicts that arose on an entirely different
MUD, one of the persons being subjected to the hateful treatment mailed
the bannees and told them to grow up and leave him alone. When they tried
to use this mail as proof that he was harassing them, the Admin staff had
enough of them. Their GL was even talking about quitting because of the
constant stress she was under from them.

The bottom line is that if you hate someone from Reflections of the Wheel
or Tales of the Ta'veren or The Creator's Shadow or where ever, leave it
there. Trying to get us to punish a player because of bad relations you
have with them elsewhere is likely to backfire on you. If they truly
are just Satan incarnate, give them enough rope and they'll do something
we can punish them for. Or even better, expend your efforts bitching
at the admin on the place where the conflict arose. You'll have a better
chance of succeeding.

      <text>Greetings all,

I'd like every one of you to meet a friend of mine. His name is Joey. I've been recently thinking alot about Joey (like I have since I was about 13 or so) and have decided that Joey's name just isn't proportionate to the person, place or thing (noun) it was naming. After deliberating whether to change Joey's name to one a bit more longer and therefore more fitting to a 'noun' of Joey's stature or to merely give Joey a last name...

...if you haven't figured it out yet, Joey is the key component of my wedding tackle, and he needs a new last name! Between now and midnight October 31st, 2003... I will be taking requests for last names for my little buddy. Submissions will be judged and awarded a placement: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Honorable Mention. The First Place winner will receive 5 questpoints and the dubious honor of having given my uhh... a last name. Second place winner will receive 3 qps. Third place winners will receive 2 qps, and Honorable Mentions (there may be more the one) will receive 1 qp and a pat on the arse. So! Get those creative juices flowing, get mail sent to me with your suggestions and then get RPing, since that's why you're all here anyways...

...not to name power tools.

      <text>Evening, folks.

The name is Marra and I am the newly elected Creator for Dragon's Fang.
A lot of you are familiar with me and don't really need any introduction
as to who I am other than knowing that my more popular mortal alts have
been Jenevieve and Gwendolyn (Gwen having been the name posted as an
applicant).

Now, on to business. I have a lot of plans. The best way to sum it up
right this minute - turning things around and moving in the opposite
direction. We want fun, we want people, we want fun people.

We're at a very important place in Fang history, believe it or not. Here
we stand, ready and waiting to turn things around. To some that means
being a little like this place used to be, being what it is, and being
more than you could believe. It's going to take work, no doubt about
that. I want you to come to me and tell me what you want, what you
think this place needs. Right now is the time that it means so very
much. That isn't to say it won't in the future, but here is the golden
opportunity. Open communication lines are very important so don't be
afraid to approach me on the game or by messenger or even email.

I realize this didn't give away all my mystical plans and show what
I have planned, but the specifics are long and boring. I'd rather
you ask me personally to open up the communication lines. :)

*dusts hands* Now lets have some fun!

      <text>We're experiencing some kind of problem with the game. Here a bit ago,
we starting having to recover pfiles from a directory because they
weren't being saved. Well, it would seem that two days ago, the MUD
started disallowing all incoming connections. We are currently trying
to locate and fix the problem but if you have difficulty signing in,
that is likely why. I would suggest that when this happens, get in
touch with an admin of the game and the game will be restarted. It
shouldn't lock up for hours again but just in case here's the note to
give you a heads up. Questions can be directed to me.

empty slots on wizlist, so send in applications to fill'em up!  The format
is below.    
Submit an essay-style application, which answers all of the below:

1) Tell about yourself, your characters, your experiences on fang, etc.
2) What experience do you have with Imming/GLing?
3) What qualifications do you have for the job you want?
4) If hired, what are your plans for the guild?
5) Anything else you'd like us to know?

It has been a while since we had an emote combat tournament. We are
considering holding another, but only if there is sufficient interest. If
you are interested in competing, just send me a short mudmail saying so.

For those of you who think you aren't good enough... It has been my
experience that tournaments teach a person a lot more about emote fighting
than any amount of syllabus lessons.

It is also a good way to get your name noticed by the people who hand out
herons and such. Active participation in tournaments is definitely helpful
on a blademastery application.


Feel free to send me a tell or a mudmail if you have any questions.

      <text>As the title should have told you, there have been some changes made to
the guild system.  The group leader concept has been changed back towards
a more Immortal Guildleader/Mortal Guildleader type system, though every
immortal will be in charge of two or more guilds.  Wizlist is updated and
accurate, so take a look at it.  You'll  also notice Ogier, Seafolk, and
Tuatha'an are no longer on the wizlist.  All three have been changed to
subguilds due to lack of activity, and Seafolk has been closed to new
appliants.  They are, respectively, Seanchan, Seanchan, and Nations. So
if you want to make one, talk to the write Guildleader. =)
Throw any questions you have my way.  You know my mudmail.

      <text>FYI:

POLICY PLAYER has now been updated. A few rules in there are still a
little iffy on how they apply to us now and how we play, but they
have been left in for a few different reasons. Biggest changes:

The 48 hour rule has been reduced from 48 to 24. Yup. That means
that if you gentle yourself, you only have a one day wait.

I added to the rule about tooling and crafting as well as adding in
a blurb about sharing pfiles when one is a Mort GL.

If you notice stuff is missing, it's likely because it meant nothing
to our current practices.

However, if you see something that needs to be added, please feel
free to mudmail me. I'm always willing to listen.

      <text>Firstly, if you haven't read &amp;rhelp quests&amp;n, please do. Secondly, I'm 
a new Storyteller. If you've read the help file, then you know it's my
responsibility to assist all of you with your roleplaying experiences.
Yay!
I've got pom-pom's and everything!
Seriously, if you decide you'd like to run an IC event of your own, the
steps to follow are outlined in &amp;rhelp quests&amp;n. Again, I encourage you
to read that. It's my job to keep you happy, but it's your job to keep me
busy! Flood my mailbox with requests. Make me work for that pretitle!
Also, not -all- of the quests I do will be IC RP quests. Gotta show some
love for that OOC stuff as well, right? And since I'm new to this position
suggestions are most welcome. Suggestions for the -type- of quests, I mean,
not as to how many times a day a quest should be run, or what time of day
is best for you to beg me to run a quest. Not that I expect any of you to
do either of those things. I know full well that you all know better.
Ahem.
Now then, my job, really, is to make this place even more fun and exciting
than it already is. I can't do that by myself. I can certainly try, but
the result will probably not be what either of us was hoping for. Those
of you who know me in my other forms know that I will always listen to
what you have to say. Tell me what you think about what I'm doing, or, in 
some cases, what I'm -not- doing. Questions, comments, suggestions, even
complaints - all are welcome. The more comfortable I feel in my new position,
the more quests and different types of quests I'll be able to run. But if my
first quest sucks, and nobody tells me, all the rest are going to suck, too.
Keep that in mind. Constructive criticism is a good thing.
Deanna.

      <text>So we've had a pretty good influx within the Nations ranks, mostly in the
Nobility levels and that's great.  But with all the rulers, we need
rulees!  So this is what I'm going to do to try and encourage people to
play servants, guards and other positions within the Nations guild that
does not include a Lord or Lady rank.  Number one, I'm raising the amount
of sponsors needed for a Noble character from two to four.  With all the
new guys and old guys we have around, I really don't see this as being a
problem.  I'll even offer to be one of the sponsors if people ask me for
some roleplay.  Number two, I'm going to offer five questpoints right off
for anyone that makes a character within nations other than a noble as
well offer to award them an additional two qps, on top of the five they
would already get, for any roleplay logs that I receive.  So think up some
interesting character concepts, get with some of the Nobles and see if any
of them would be willing to have a maid, a butler, guard or perhaps even
part-time seamstress.  The number of ideas that someone can come up with
are really limitless and you're not constricted by the rules that usually
govern a noble's behavior.
