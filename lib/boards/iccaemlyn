      <text>They burned my bar, they did!  The bastards just burned it right down! One
moment I was minding my own business, serving fine ales, and the next...
Light!  Whitecloaks dead everywhere, those Asha'men fellows running about
playing with fires and freezing men in their tracks, and before I can even
gather my wits, I'm standing outside watching the roof fall in!  I'll tell
you right now, it's a sad day in Caemlyn.  Next thing we know, things'll
be right back where they were the last few years, with bits of our city
going up in flames every night.  I hate to say it, but sometimes those darn
Whitecloaks have the right of it...  this city draws trouble like it truly
did lay under the Shadow!
Anyway, I'll be darned if I put up with this much longer...  I think I'll
go live with my sister in the country.  I figure they could use a barman
at the Inn in my folks old town...  And you should do the same.  It's not
safe for plain folks in this town any longer.

      <text>(the text is written in a rather scrabbly hand, seemingly shaking)

&amp;YToday as I visited my favorite inn in this light-forsaken city,
I first learned that the cook had been killed by a gleeman in front of
a dragonsworn and some young girl. All they knew what was they looked like,
the gleeman had (Description of Em) the dragonsworn fellow on the other hand,
he had (Description of Vinas) and the little girl, why she (Description of Mehan).

When drenching my sorrows in ale, in comes this huge whitecloak, he looked like
something the cat would've &amp;K(explicitive squinted out)&amp;Y with. Anyway, he looked
(Description of Brutham) and he joined forces with another fellow to dictate
how much he hated the entire city and the entire inn. Of course we answered him
and the fight was on. The Whitecloak threw me across the room! And he had help
from that fellow, a Seanchan by the sound of speech, looking like (Description of
Edrenel). But anyway, I am back to the inn to continue my own business.

But right now, I'd say that the gleeman is wanted dead or alive by many people,
as is that little girl and the dragonsworn. The honest patronage of the inn doesn't
like that people come about killing their favorite cooks.

They had better watch their backs.

      <text>In an effort to promote better relations with the Aes Sedai, I have
decided to lessen the restrictions against women channeling in Caemlyn.
Any Aes Sedai who wishes to be able to channel freely in this city
should report to the Captain of the Queen's Guard. Her name and
description will be taken down and passed to those whose duty it is to
enforce this law. The Aes Sedai must wear her ring and shawl openly if
she wishes to have freedom to channel. Any woman who is not an Aes
Sedai, but who wishes to be allowed to channel, should also report to
the Captain. She will be given an armband to signify that she has
complied with the law and is allowed to channel. It will also serve to
identify her to the Asha'man who enforce this decree. The Aiel Wise
Ones are known to me already. As they are quite distinctive, they will
be required to wear no further emblems and are considered to already
have complied with this law. Any woman who channels without wearing the
outward signs of compliance shall be captured and incarcerated. She
shall also be held fully responsible for any consequences of resisting
arrest. Any man, other than myself, who channels without wearing the
black coat of the Asha'man shall be captured if possible or killed if
necessary. 
Rand al'Thor
The Dragon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OOC NOTE:
Any woman who wishes to channel in Caemlyn without being arrested
should mail both myself and Kaliendrick a brief letter informing us of
such. She should then include in her doing whenever IC that she is
wearing her ring and shawl or if not an aes sedai that she has the 
white silk strip emblazoned with a dragon tied around her upper left
arm. Any man that wishes to channel in Caemlyn without severe penalties
should join the Asha'man.

      <text>&amp;rBlood&amp;n splattered walls and seared overturned tables greeted
the Queen's guard two days passed as the second common room of the
Half Moon Inn was said to have suddenly burst with a loud explosion
sending shards of glass into the streets of Caemlyn.

Witnesses say two guardsman responded promptly to reports and 
thundered into the Half Moon Inn with swords readied, only to
meet their fate at a second explosion which took their lives 
sending armor and flesh throughout the inn. The entry way to 
the second common room reportedly collapsed and guardsman worked
rigorously to clear the debris to check for survivors. To the 
disheartened guardsman, there were no survivors.

Witnesses mention seeing a bright flash of light through the 
broken windows just before the second group of guardsman arrived
at the scene.

Every day it seems like a stranger rumor spreads through the city like
wildfire. This is perhaps the strangest of all. Travellers passing through
from Aringill report Sea Folk ships docked in that town. Some claim to 
have seen this with their own eyes. Stranger still, some are saying they've
heard even more Sea Folk ships are docked in Cairhien. But.. surely that
is impossible.

much to out dismay, forbidden crossbows.  They demanded the Innkeepers
money... or his life.  It was shortly after when half a dozen Aiel
savages burst through the door, stepping over the shattered wooden
shards left by the thieves when they had done the same, and charged
the wrongdoers, their spears bursting bellies and their feet crushing
heads.. in the end, not a bandit survived and three Aiel were dead, 
victim to crossbow bolts and the tips of criminal sword.

The rumors are as many as there are mouths, but one thing is for sure. A Shaido has been seen, enemy of Aiel supporters of the Lord Dragon himself, within Caemlyn. He is as tall as a horse!

    I was at that Goat festival thing today, you know, the one that that
crazy Goat cult threw? I never heard of them before today, but whatever.
Some savage, black-veiled Aielman started a fight with some poor men who
were just singing a sweet ballad about the great Artur Hawkwing! The Aielman
started to rant angrily about men singing! And he was waving a spear at them
in a threatening manner too! But anyways, one thing led to another and a
full scale riot broke out. To make it worse, some Blackcoat came along,
and he started to go mad from the taint! I swear it by the Light! His voice
seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. He channeled! Light, that
chills me even now as I think about it. Then, the ground erupted where
the poor lads were defending themselves against the savage Aielman, killing
them instantly! Of course, the savage wasn't hurt because they're in league
with the Blackcoats! They're all darkfriends, I tell you! After the ground
erupted, I got away from the scene as fast as my legs would carry me, along
with everyone else. The last I saw the Blackcoat, he was laughing like a
madman! And the Aielman was too! I think I even saw a Trolloc and other
Shadowspawn too! I swear by the Light!

      <text>   Conal McFaddan owned a small inn in Mayene, and it was there that he
married his wife, Sarai; the daughter of a local farmer whom Conal had 
been buying his vegetables from.  After they married, Conal built a small
suite above his inn for himself and Sarai and they lived there quite
happily for the first few years of their marraige.  Sarai eventually found
herself to be with child and this news both excited and frightened Conal 
for he had heard tales that the Tairen army had attacked the First of
Mayene's guards and were on their way into Mayene itself. &quot;Sarai,&quot; he said
one evening, taking her hand in his, &quot;I fear what will happen if the Tairen
army does invade Mayene. I fear what will happen to you and our child.&quot;
Sarai looked at her husband with concerned eyes, &quot;What do you propose
we do then, Conal?&quot; she asked, already knowing the answer.  

  He looked around their home then finally at the floor, he had to look
anywhere but at her.  &quot;I fear we must leave Mayene, wife, and soon. After
the baby is here and you are well enough to travel,&quot; he looked up at her
tear streaked face, &quot;Sarai, please. I know this is hard, but I cannot risk 
losing you or the child.&quot;  Sarai nodded and wiped her face, &quot;I understand
Conal, but where? Where will we go? Our whole lives are here, we cannot
just pack up our entire lives and leave.  Especially not knowing where we
are going.&quot; She burst into full tears and Conal quickly put his arms 
around her. &quot;There now, Sarai. We will be fine, I will think of something,&quot;
he smiled as he slid his hand over her tummy, &quot;we still have a couple weeks
before the baby is here. We will leave afterwards.&quot;  She nodded slowly and
dried her eyes. &quot;If you feel we must, husband. I will follow you anywhere.&quot;

  A week later, Sarai gave birth to a healthy baby girl and they named her
Sahra Elisabeth McFaddan, after Sarai and Conal's deceased mother.  Conal
was very pleased, announcing to everyone that he now claimed the two finest
ladies in all of Mayene and throwing a celebration at his inn.  The 
festivities soon ended, however and the McFaddan's found themselves on a
ship bound for Ebou Dar.  Conal intended to travel to Amador from there.

  Two days into the voyage, disaster struck.  Conal had been standing on
the deck when he heard one of the crewman yell, &quot;Seanchan vessel, dead
ahead!&quot;  The crew seemed to be in a panic and Conal wondered who these
Seanchan were and why the crew seemed to be afraid of them.  He decided
that he should go below with his wife and daughter.

  He had just entered their quarters and let the door close behind him
when the ship lurched and he heard footsteps overhead and then on the
stairs.  Suddenly, the door burst open behind him, sending him sprawling
onto the floor and over where Sahra slept in her crib.  A woman 
entered, leading another woman clad in a grey dress on a silver leash.

&quot;Where?&quot; the first woman asked, she was obviously the leader.
The leashed woman pointed to Sarai.  The leader smiled and patted the 
leashed woman on the head and yelled, &quot;In here!&quot;
A third woman entered then, carrying a leash much like the one the 
other woman wore, and began to approach Sarai.  Conal jumped up and
threw himself in front of his wife demanding to know what was
going on.  
&quot;This woman can channel and therefore must be collared for the safety 
of others as well as her own,&quot; said the leader.
With that, the third woman advanced on them again and Conal reached out 
and grabbed her arms, holding her back.  The leader looked at the 
leashed woman and nodded and Conal suddenly found himself against
the wall, unable to move.  After a struggle, the collar was snapped
around Sarai's neck and as she reached to try and remove it, she 
fell to the floor gagging.

&quot;You see,&quot; said the third woman as she snapped a bracelet around her 
wrist, &quot;you will be in pain if you do not obey. Now up with you, it 
is time to leave.&quot;
On shakey legs, Sarai stood and stumbled for the door.

      <text>There was a post on this board regarding an RP quest in Two Rivers.
This post was removed because, of the 5 GLs that should have been
notified and informed -BEFORE- the post went up, 4 have definately
not been told and the 5th probably was not either.
 
Any and all quests need to be handled through the GLs of whichever
guilds are involved. &amp;RAny&amp;n occurance of trollocs, shadowspawn,
bubbles of evil, NPC dfs, Chosen, etc, needs to have the stamp
of approval from either Tzeentch or myself. If such RP/quest is
discovered to have taken place without our consent, it will be nulled.
 
To clarify -- Quests and RP are welcome. Even the posted quest
can be dealt with if it is handled in a proper fashion. When
things like guilds and shadowspawn come into play, the GLs have
to know. This is policy... always has been. And it's mainly for
the morts protection -- so we can help our guildies, advise them,
and just generally to be informed. This is why we have GLs, folks...
To handle the messy details.
 
Thank you, drive through.

Rumors fly faster than pigeons and are harder to decypher sometimes than
Cairienin Daes codes. -Something- is happening in Shienar, but who to
believe? At least crime dropped when the rumor passed through that the
Horn of Valere had been found. The innkeepers seem less than pleased at
how fast those Hunters cleared out, though. Just as many voices claim that
it is gold or silver that someone has found in those mountains along the
blight. Some who are obviously touched by the Light even claim that it is
the Green Man come to town and performing like a gleeman. A thousand
rumors, each stranger than the one before it. They cannot all be true, but
one thing is certain.. so much noise has to have a reason.

Whitecloaks are claiming credit for this assault, the entire grounds
scorched from the earth.  Apparently the Whitecloaks had it on
good say-so that the rabble-rouser Masema, the self-proclaimed
Prophet of the Lord Dragon Reborn, had returned to the city of
Samara.  Apparently more than a few confirmed encounters with
the madman on the outskirts of Amador where he wages battle on
the Children of The Light there.  It only follows that the blasted
Whitecloaks would take the opportunity to strike on the less formid-
able opponent in Caemlyn, no?  It's said there are no survivors from
the blazes set by the Children and the manor surely is nothing but a
ashen pile.  Authorities are ambivalent on taking action on the matter
to say the least.

I refer you to post #4 on this board, except that with no active player
for Rand, one should mail the Houses GL and Amarinda instead of Rand and
Kaliendrick. Be very aware that anyone blatantly channeling in the city
can have an IMM drop a ton of NPC'd Asha'man on his or her head just for
a good solid reminder.

The sword tournament in Aringill has concluded. A young man named Tanen
walked away with the prize.

      <text>     To the interested-

     This is a calling to all those that have a love for the arts and learning.
There is a need for funding on a project in Lugard. This project is the 
building of a new library in the capitol of Murandy. Also, there is a need
for books of all sorts- no topic is to narrow minded. This project comes
as a movement for higher education in the southern lands has sparked a 
fire in the wine fields of the most central land, Murandy. There is also
a dire need for tutors and learned people- again, no focus is too narrow.
     Anyone wishing to search out this cause for any reason, or who 
would like to have more information, please feel free to contact the
Circle of Higher Hopes- based in Lugard. Anyone wishing to donate money 
or books should seek out the same source in the same location. The 
Circle of Higher Hopes wishes to free the minds of all through informing
the masses. 
     *attached is an address in Lugard, Murandy*

      <text>A messenger arrived from Ghealdan bearing the following message:

Cheron Katranna, the barmaid from the Golden Bowl, has died at the hands
of the Seanchan in Amadicia.  She had been visiting her hometown of Sehar
in Ghealdan, and crossed into Amadicia around the time of the invasion.
Her escort, Captain Vlemar Ratelin of the Queen's Guard, accompanied her
there, where both met up with the Seanchan forces.  He was able to bring
her back to Sehar where they both died of their injuries.
