    <desc>Thieves guild is a guild devoted to the protection of all thieves in the Caemlyn area.  Whether this applies to helping them during the times when they are down on their luck, or if they have been caught and need to be broken out, or need help learning the skills.  We help all thieves, but if after a certain amount of time, you are not good enough, sorry, we only want the best.  We provide members with jobs, as people come to us when they need to get something that they cannot buy.
If you are a thief, in the Caemlyn area, and desire protection and commaraderie, we are the guild for you.

  <ghelp keyword="ranks">
    <entry>This is a help file explaining what each of the ranks are.
Master thief:  The best of the best.  All master thieves can be identified by a tattoo of a black knife on their wrist.  These people are the people that you come to if you have any problems, questions, or concerns.
Pickpocket: Just your average thief, normally a child, but some older people make a killing getting gold from loose purses of nobles that think themselves above a target.  *hint hint*
Burglar:  The people that break into houses and steal things, the most dangerous of the petty thievery *pickpockets and burglars are considered petty, sorry to those ranks :P*.
Muggers:  All that live in New York should know this, but for the rest of us country bumkins, the people that find you in a deserted alley and find out how generous people are at knifepoint.
Bandit:  Those nice men that make sure your purses are lighter, along with other things, when you go travelling.
Lawyer:  The meanest, dirtiest of us all, *jk elly!*.  This is a rank just for fun, and just for honourary people.
Highwaymen:  You know, the dudes that in stories all the girls wanna, well, this isn't obscene.  :P  The romantic bandit, Robin Hood esque you could say.
