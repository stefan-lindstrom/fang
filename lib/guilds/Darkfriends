    <desc>Darkfriend, Friends of the Dark, the Shadowsouled, Nightrunners, they have
been called by many names by many people, but they all mean the same thing:
Someone who has forsaken the light and pledged their soul and lives to
serve the Shadow. It is not easy for many people to understand why someone
would want to become a Darkfriend, but there are many possible explanations.
One possibility is that these people are seduced by promises of wealth,
power and even immortality for their service to the Dark One.
Others are perhaps castoffs from society, and seek revenge against those
who scorned them, or perhaps some are forced to serve the shadow against
their will, and eventually are mired so deep that they cannot escape. 
Yet despite the methods that have brought about their oaths to the dark,
we can suspect that they have served well, for the Dark One has never 
been a lenient master.
There is little that is truly known about those who have pledged their lives
in service to the shadow, and much that is suspected. One thing that is
known, is that a darkfriend would rather die than betray their oaths, for it
is suspected that the Lord of the Grave has found some way to punish his
minions even beyond their own death. As for where darkfriends come from,
there has been much speculation, and little hard evidence. It seems that
anyone could be one of the Friends of the Dark, regardless of what country
they are from, or their social status, from king to beggar. Those people
who have admitted to being a darkfriend before they died, have come from
all lots in life, so it seems the Lord of the Grave will use anyone he can
to advance his goals.

    <reqs>If you are seeking to become a Dreadlord do NOT follow these steps, 
instead follow the steps listed under the Dreadlord subguild. However,
one can become a darkfriend first, and later join the ranks of those 
most selective servants.

1.) You must be at least Level 20, and you must NOT be Wolfkin or Ogier
2.) Guilding in another non-dark guild is recommended, but not strictly
required.
3.) MUDmail your background to Shai'tan
4.) Type: 'seekguild 21'
5.) Acquire sufficient sponsors for guilding. This number may vary at
Shai'tan's discretion.
6.) You must swear the oath to the great Lord, which will be administered
either by a Chosen or another Darkfriend.

Backgrounds:
As well as a background you must have an acceptable description, you 
will not be authorized until Shai'tan has seen, and accepted both. 
Your background should be a brief account of everything that has 
happened in your character's life prior to the time you send it in.
If this information has not been RPed out, it should be kept simple
and should not include vast amounts of training from unknown sources.
You may also mail your description with your background, although this
is not required.
