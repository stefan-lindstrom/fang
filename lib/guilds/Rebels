    <desc>   Aes Sedai and their Warders who have broken with the Tower and now are
placed in Salidar.  They are ruled by Egwene al'Vere, a childhood friend
of Rand al'Thor.    
</desc>
    <reqs>1. You must be level 20. This is a requirement in all guilds.

2. You must send in your background to the guildleaders. You should 
   mail this background to the IMM GL -and- the Mort GL of the
   division you are seeking. For example, if you are seeking the warder
   half of the guild, then mail both Cappen and Kyle.
   This background should consist of the following things:
     &amp;CCharacter's full name.
     Character's race and nation of birth.
     Which side of the guild you are seeking.
     Character's strengths and weaknesses.
     Any other guilds the character is seeking or belonging to.
     Any unusual attributes. (for example, being a pale skinned and 
     fair-haired member of the Sea Folk)
     IC reason the character is seeking the guild.
     OOC reason the player is seeking the guild.
     A -brief- background.&amp;n
Backgrounds that involve other guilds will take longer to process. This
is not to punish you for having a varied character. It is just that it
takes longer to contact the other GLs involved than simply to read a
background and approve or disapprove it. 

3. Your character must be female if you channel and wish to become Aes
   Sedai.

4. Male channelers, wolfkin and female characters are strongly
   discouraged from becoming warders. In the case of wolfkin, that 
   guild has a policy which limits the number of them who may become
   warders. For female characters and male channeler characters the IC
   and OOC reasons for the guild will be scrutinized &amp;RMUCH&amp;n more 
   closely than for other characters. It is unusual to advertise for
   other guilds, however, if a female character is seeking the warders
   out of some misguided idea that they are the only ones who can teach
   her to fight, she has options that are more ICly feasible. The
   Seanchan culture accepts female soldiers without any reservations. 
   The Cairhienin have sword societies that women can join. The Aiel
   have the Maidens of the Spear. Given the current make up of the MUD,
   all three of these options are both more unique and more ICly 
   appropriate. However, if a female character truly wishes to be a
   warder, it is not forbidden. In the case of male channelers, there
   is no IC way that the guild could screen against this. However, it
   should be noted that if the character is ICly revealed as a MC, he
   will be gentled.

5. AFTER your background is approved, you have two options for entering
   the guild. You can opt to be one of the novices or trainees who was
   with the Rebels when they fled Tar Valon or you can choose to RP
   your entrance into the guild. For the first option, you will have to
   be interviewed by the IMM GL or a Mort GL for the side of the guild
   you seek. If you choose to RP out joining the guild, you will need
   to RP with members of the guild capable of bringing you to Salidar.
   In most instances this will mean that at least one of the &quot;sponsors&quot;
   must be an Aes Sedai with the ability to Travel. If you choose to
   journey to Salidar on your own, you will need to arrange to RP your
   capture and interrogation. It is inconceivable that you could make
   it to the center of the village without being challenged by 
   the sentries. If you feel there are special circumstances involved,
   you will need to negotiate that with a GL.

6. You must wear an acceptable description. If you are unsure what this
   entails, there is a rather spiffy guide to writing descriptions and
   backgrounds on the Fang webpage: 
   http://mud.karen.hik.se/help/rpguide.html
   

7. Or, a slightly simpler approach is to check out the web application
   forms. For Sedai, http://www.geocities.com/kaith_athanes/rasapp.html
   For warders, http://www.geocities.com/kaith_athanes/rwapp.html

    <gossip>
Rumour is, that the Dragon Reborn had a number of Sedai swear fealty to him
after the event now known as 'Dumai's Wells'.  It seems some of these
Sedai were of Salidar and he has written to the Amyrlin Seat, requesting
that these Sedai who swore fealty to him, be sent to Caemlyn.  Our
Mother is apparently displeased about this, but has given her leave for 
these Sedai to go attend to the Lord Dragon.

It was heard, in passing, that one of our more... bookish.. Sedai, has 
fallen head over heels in love with a certain Master at Arms.

A certain Blue Sitter has fallen out of favour with the Amyrlin due to
the unexplained absences of her and her Gaidin from Salidar.

The Mistress of Novices has been missing for quite some time, necessitating
her replacement. Rumor has it that she left Salidar with another sister's
warder, but the rumors are quite diverse as to which. Lauriana's own warder,
Adrian, was recently seen leaving the village riding a horse laden with
supplies. Of special notice, he was wearing his cloak which he very rarely
did. As he left the perimeter, one of the sentries pleasantly asked his
destination. So far the sentry has refused to relay what he was told, saying
only that he does not use such language.

An shadowy figure has been seen in the woods around Salidar, or in the trees
in the square.  No one seems to know who the shadowy figure could be, as he 
seems to be as at home in the trees as on the ground.  Many have also heard 
strange music emanating from the woods or seemingly empty trees.

  <ghelp keyword="Sedai-Sponsorship">
    <entry>To become guilded in the Rebel Aes Sedai as a Novice, you must be 1) female
 2) a channeller and 3)  have five sponsors.  Three of these sponsors must
be of full Aes Sedai rank, the other two may be Gaidin, Novices or
Accepted.

To become a Protectorate or Servant within the Rebel Aes Sedai, one must
have 3 sponsors of any of the following ranks: Aes Sedai, Gaidin, Novice
or Accepted.
</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="Sponsorship">
    <entry>A few notes on Sponsoring Seekers:

First, only Gaidin can sponsor seekers.  If our
numbers ever dip too low for this to be practical,
the policy will be changed.  Until then, Charges,
Trainees, and Advanced Trainees can still RP with
the seeker, but may not give sponsorship.

Second, a seeker must attain five sponsorships
for entry into the Rebel Warders.  Three of these
must be Rebel Gaidin, while the other two may
be either Rebel Gaidin or Rebel Aes Sedai.

Third, please do not bring a seeker to Salidar
until they have ICly attained your trust.
Remember, we are still trying to keep our location
at least somewhat secret.  If you feel you must
bring a seeker to Salidar for some reason, but
you do not ICly trust them completely, you may
bring him and place him within a cell in Salidar.
Mail the Master at Arms (Kirid) and tell him you
have placed the prisoner within a cell.

Fourth, as an OOC measure, we do NOT take
channelers within our ranks.  This is non-
negociable.  If the channeler wishes to join,
they must be gentled prior to becoming a Charge.

Fifth and finally, we will most likely NOT be
taking any further females within the Gaidin.
They may send a background to the Guildleader,
but it will be placed under much more intense
scrutiny than most other backgrounds (which is
not to say that other backgrounds will be viewed
laxly).  This is a measure to retain some
semblance of bookishness, and because life truely
is not fair.

  <ghelp keyword="Spar Information">
    <entry>Spars are an integral part of the training of
Gaidin, as they are first-hand experience in
the tactics and trials of combat.  They consist
of emote fights between two or more characters
using lathes, live steel, or no weapons at all.

No Charge is to spar with or against live steel.

An Advanced Spar may count as a Supervised or
Unsupervised spar.  A Supervised Spar may count
as an Unsupervised Spar.


An Advanced Spar is a spar in which there are
either more than two participants, or one in
which the Trainee is wielding (a) weapon(s) other
than a sword or sword and dagger.  Alternately,
an Advanced Spar may include the Trainee facing
a weapon he has never fought against before
(excluding swords and daggers, but including
the Arafellin twin-sword style).

Emote (Armed or UnArmed) Combat - Fundamentals

This document is intended to present a brief overview of the emote combat
fundamentals and to eliminate or deter the abuse of the emote combat
ettiquette. Furthermore, this is not a written in stone method or
practice, but rather an aid or possible solution to current or pending
problems which could arise.

1. The Basics of emote combat.

Emote combat is used on Roleplaying Muds to simulate hand to hand
or weapon to weapon combat. Emote is used in a command line entry, and
followed by a string of characters which represents the actions of what
the character/player emoting is doing.

Here's an Example.

emote smiles at John doe.

What the others see is about the same, except that emote is replaced by
your character name.

When you are initiating emote combat, there are simple rules that
must be adhered to, now each rule, is dependant upon Mud policies and
procedures. On some Muds, you can in fact assume that you are able to
parry an incoming attack. However, as you will read further down in this
document, there are acceptions to that rule. When engaged in combat, it is
very important that you utilize a simple system of Who, What, Where, How,
and of course When.

</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="ecf2">
    <entry>2. Knowing your limitations.

Now, to understand what I'm talking about, you should first ask yourself a
few questions before you go off into battle and attempt to stay alive.

First,

Who is my character and what is my character capable of?  Is your
character a Soldier, a thief, or a Warder?  What kind of training does
your character have?  Is he/she good with certain weapons? Is he/she fully
ranked in his or her respected field or career?.

These are all valid questions that you should already have a firm
understanding of, before you attempt to begin a spar or battle with other
players. You have to know your limitations. It does absolutely no good for
a Guild to require a syllabus and require guildmembers to learn to be
skilled with their weapons, if the player is going to already assume they
are the greatest swordsman alive.

Essentially, it's about compromise. When you enter the guild, you are at
the ground level, you have to Ic'ly learn and practice to get better. Sure
it's annoying to lose fights, but that's what makes a good emote fighter.
Learning from your mistakes will ultimately make you far more valueable
and far more deadly as you progress through your training and are promoted
to higher ranks within the guild.

Do not be afraid to trip or miss a step, and get hit. Taking hits is
something that should happen, and realistically, it would happen.  Think
of it like this, Sugar Ray Leonard started out as a kid, he was slow, he
was sloppy, and he was uncoordinated. He got knocked on his rear quite a
bit. And over time, his awareness and mental notes of his mistakes began
to shape him into a better fighter.  He became quicker, could hit harder,
could move fluidly, and ended up being one of the greatest boxers of all
time. Before you get too excited, just remember, Sugar Ray Leonard still
got hit, even when he was one of the best.

    <entry>3. Progression.

Congratulations, you have been promoted to the next rank in your
guild. Now those are always welcome words to read or hear, boy I bet now
your thinking you are the king of the training yard, and can whip any man,
woman or child that steps before you! *cough* Don't kid yourself.

As you progress through your ranks, you have to pay attention to what your
doing while still remaining aware of your limitations. Sure, you're faster
now, and your more comfortable, but that does not make you an instant
master of the sword.  You should slowly build your character's skill level
up, show that you are progressing and getting better, but do not over do
it. And above all, take hits when they are warranted.

*Gasp* Did he just say &quot;When they are warranted?&quot;

Why yes I did. Uponinitial rank, your expected to get beat up a little 
bit, after all, your just beginning, however as you progress, you should
begin to work on the fundamentals of good emote fighting. 

Focus on your movement, on your strategies, and on making each emote you 
do, descriptive enough to be clear to those you are fighting or sparring. 
You should never be disillusioned as to what you are doing as some common,
slash to the middle, kick to the groin scanario. Your essentially playing
chess with your opponent. Each move you make should be well thought out and 
placed, to put you in a position to strike your opponent or even win the 
battle.

**Author's Statement: EMOTE COMBAT IS A THINKING MAN/WOMAN'S GAME!

As you fight, you must always be thinking about what is going on. And if
you do not know, do not be foolish and attempt to emote something in
response. You must be crystal clear with what is happening. You move and
maneuver to gain an advantage over your opponent, not to look fancy or
show off your characters illustrious charm.  IF YOU ARE NOT SURE as to
what your opponent is trying to do, then you should STOP the roleplay, and
ask out of character, and continue to ask if you need to, until you
understand what it is, the character your facing is trying to do.

    <entry>4.  Advanced Emote Combat Techniques.

Earlier, I talked about a simple system that utilizes Who, What,
Where, How, and When. Now is a good time to bring this into focus a little
better. When your emoting, your actually trying to give those around you,
including your opponent, a mental picture of what your are doing. To do
this, you have to be descriptive in your emotes.  To give you a better
and point out what should be emphasized.

Jack stands facing Brid, eyes intent upon the man before him.
Jack's right hand remains upon the cool hilt of the blade on his left hip.
Brid draws his own blade and brings a left to right horizontal slash
across at Jack's chest. Jack in turn, smoothly brings his blade out of 
it's sheath in a left to right, horizontal parry, his blade's tip pointing 
skywards. As the blade's connect, Jack immediately steps in with his
right foot and tears his blade down from Brid's left shoulder to right
hip in an **attempted** diagonal slash.

This emote demonstrates fundamental use of the system I talked about, 
we know exactly who is involved, where they are, what they're doing, 
and how they are doing it.  We even know when they are attempting to
do these maneuvers.   This is an acceptable emote. *Granted it's
not my best by far, and it was 3am when I wrote this* but it will
do in a battle. 

I want you to also note the word &quot;Attempted&quot; in that emote.. those 
keywords need to be used often when making an attack upon another
person.. Never ever ever assume you hit them.

Ah, you noticed I automatically parried in that emote! Good for you, 
some muds have made this acceptable, some have not.. If your mud
has made this acceptable, then you need to keep in mind realism in 
a closed parry, if your falling and laying on your back when a thrust
is brought at you from behind, be realistic. Your not superman, your
a soldier, or warrior or even Gaidin.

Now the thinking game begins, you must successfully move and maneuver and
catch your opponent off guard or in a defensive folly, to take 
advantage of the battle. I've actually seen some great emote 
fighting, where neither man won..  They eventually withdrew because
they both in turn could not defeat one another. 

Keep in mind what your limitations are.
If your facing a skilled opponent and you just found that sword a few
minutes ago, then make sure you roleplay that.  If you are unskilled, or
not fully trained, and you are doing a difficult maneuver, why not have
your foot slip on loose dirt, or accidentally trip? Your not supposed to
ever be perfect and let's face it, if your trying to do complicated stuff,
and your not trained, your going to folly it. The best rp I've ever
watched, was a new recruit who did get hit, and did trip and slip. That
recruit however, ended up outwitting the Trainee he was fighting, by
keeping it simple, and realizing that he wasn't trained, and that he would
have to outwit the opponent by keeping it simple and doing what he knew he
could.

You should be practicing and getting better with your emotes as you
progress in your guild, it will show not only in the guild rp, but in all
your rp. Be descriptive, uses senses, sounds, sights, actions, etc etc.
That is the key to good emote fighting and good emoting in general.

    <entry>5. The &quot;SuperWarder.&quot;

On occasion, we run across a player who has lost touch with
reality and deemed themselves a God, who cannot make mistakes, and 
can't be harmed or beaten in any way.  These types truly disgust me. That shows
us, that they are so arrogant, that they would inentionally take away from
the enjoyment of others and the overall goals that we wish to accomplish
as Roleplayers.

Super Warders or Super Characters, simply put, do NOT exist. You could be
the greateast swordsman alive, but you didn't get that title by not
getting hit, and by not suffereing the training and constant practice. And
you definately were not perfect when you did get to the level you have
reached, nor will you ever be so perfect as to not have flaws.

Generally, in most Muds, and especially in Roleplaying Muds, Super
Characters are not allowed, nor are they welcome in guilds or other Mud
related functions. I would venture to say, that if you are a trainee in
some guild, and you decide to become one of these untouchables, you will
either be bounced down to the lowest rank in the guild and left there
until you learn how to play nice, or you will be dealt with severely.  It
is not recommended that you continue to foolishly assume you are a super
character, especially not after your Guildleader has talked to you. People
who do this, are showing disrespect to the players and to the Mud.  I know
that in my case, if I catch it happening, I would be inclined to send the
character back to emote combat lessons, and demote them to the rank which
is equivalent to that lesson, until they can play fairly. If they still
abused this, I would probably throw them out of the guild permanently.

    <entry>6. Multi-Talented Combat.

Essentially, I wasn't going to write about this issue on this
particular document, but it has come to mind recently, a friend of mine
mentioned it on the Mud I play.  On certain Muds, there is a policy that
says that during emote combat, a character has the right for an
&quot;successful parry.&quot; This isn't really an issue, but.. In the event that
your fighting someone and they do something foolish, like the example
below, I would assume, that the successful parry would indeed apply to the
situation.

In this instance, two men have gotten into a dispute, both are armed with
swords.  Joe steps in and attacks with a punch to the face at Josh (who
just so happens to have a sword at guard). Now, Josh parries the incoming
fist with his sword in the &quot;successful parry regime.&quot;  Some dispute that
this is indeed an attack against Joe, and not a parry. No.. it is
considered a parry, if you are attempting to use your sword to bat away or
otherwise stop another person's attack upon you. Granted, Joe would lose
his hand, arm or even possibly fingers. But that is not, the fault of
Josh, who was icly, set up, and prepared to parry the attack. That falls
under the &quot;Oops I messed up and now I'm hurt&quot; section.

Now, before everyone gets all bent out of shape over this, listen to this.
There are situations when a &quot;successful parry&quot; isn't realistic. If your
sword is out to your left side, and someone steps in with a fist to the
right side, that sword has a long way to move in a short bit of time to be
considered a parry. You cannot truthfully always have successful parrying,
because sometimes, your can't move fast enough to perform the maneuvers.  

Lets think about it, say I was pushed off balance and fell down on my
stomach. Would I have time, to turn around, see where the attack is coming
from, and bring my sword around in time to stop the blade that is coming
at the small of my back as I hit the ground? *shakes head vigorously* No..

Even if I managed to roll, I would still get hit. It would
be unrealistic and an unfair abuse to use the &quot;successful parry&quot; theory in
this case. My suggestion would be on this issue is to bring an immortal
into the dispute should one arise. Explain what is going on, and if
possible show the emotes again. The Immortals are there to help you and
make these tough calls.

    <entry>7. Putting it all to Use.

Alright, you finally made it to the bottom of this document, and
by now, your probably rubbing temples and slamming coffee to stay away. I
salute you, I suffered many hours of lack of sleep to get this far myself
and I wrote it.. *chuckle* During this document, I have shown you the
basics to good emote combat. This is all you need to know, to be a good
emote fighter guys and gals. The rest is practice, creativity, and
imagination.  As you gain rank, and you succeed, the better you get and
the more fun it is to roleplay with you.

I leave you with this exerpt, taken from earlier in the document.

Think of it like this, Sugar Ray Leonard started out as a kid, he was
slow, he was sloppy, and he was uncoordinated. He got knocked on his rear
quite a bit.  And over time, his awareness and mental notes of his
mistakes began to shape him into a better fighter.  He became quicker,
could hit harder, could move fluidly, and ended up being one of the
greatest boxers of all time. Before you get too excited, just remember,
Sugar Ray Leonard still got hit, even when he was one of the best.
