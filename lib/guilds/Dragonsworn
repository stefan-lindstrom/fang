    <desc>The Dragonsworn are led in the field by the Prophet Masema Dagar and 
Prophetess Valtara Talmoran.  All Dragonsworn spread the word of the
Dragon Reborn throughout the lands, following His teachings.  Their 
only mission is to spread that word and to convert others to their 
acknowledgement of the Lord Dragon as the Light made flesh.  Their
unyielding philosophy is simple, hinging only on their belief that: &quot;The
Dragon Reborn is the only salvation against the Dark One and his 
followers, as the day of the Last Battle approaches.&quot;  Those faithful 
to the Dragon have been known to be vicious and cruel on occasion in 
those attempts to display the truth of their preachings, yet many
strive to help others.  The Dragon, His Prophet and His Prophetess 
welcome all, be you a farmer or a soldier of war.

The Dragonsworn originally formed a large camp, more often referred 
to as a reckless mob, within the Ghealdan city of Samara. Since 
Prophet Masema's rallying, the 'mob' has spread out into the world, 
its members preaching of the greatness and the impending victory of
the Lord Dragon and His devout followers.

    <gossip>Jeremiah, Lanx, and Kaylar are indeed heroes!
 
Often the best battles are fought without a drop of blood.
 
The wit is indeed the sharpest of weapons to fight
the Dark One!
 
Vladd is back!  Yes, he was rescued.  It seems that Ryokui
perhaps may have aided him, but either way, he has been
received back with a banquet in his honor.  Although appearing
disheveled and a little malnourished, his smile was, as
ever, the high point of the evening.  
 
Kindrana, it seems, planted a kiss upon Vladd, which
she contends was -not- on the lips.  Opinion
varies widely.  
 
As it is, lately very few attacks have been waged
against the 'sworn.  Perhaps the Lord Dragon's
light is truly shining upon the city these days.
 
It was, however, a low point recently when a
young girl was attacked by the supposed
servants of the Lord Dragon, that is the
Asha'man.  This is only a rumor however,
since few people contend that he was seen
prior wearing a coat and pins, while others
claim he was not the same person.

Walking up the steps to the Mansion with Cedric was a certain 
young blonde female.  Bayani hasn't been seen in some time, 
having disappeared without a word.  It seems that there was a 
death in her family and she was called away.  Though she seemed 
to be ok, her eyes were slightly red rimmed and her face tearstained 
as she stood before the entrance way.  Seems as long as she is 
accepted back, she will be here to stay and will be returning to 
whatever trouble she was causing before.

In what seemed a matter pure coincidence, a handful of
the Sworn bumped into one another, along with some
other nefarious types.  It wasn't long before there was a
confrontation, there was a feral man (desc Serkan) and another,
a whitecloak (desc Lachlan), the Light burn his soul.  If that
weren't bad enough, hordes of trollocs attacked our just
brothers and sisters.  Some think the whitecloak was in league with
the shadowspawn, though who's to say?  Luckily our friends and heros
were triumphant over the shadowspawn, not only that, they sent
the whitecloak running with his sword between his legs like
the dog he was.  Some even say it was Ryokui who faced down
one of the fades admist a horde of trollocs with nary a second
glance, some say the feral man ate the fade for dinner.
It's a blurred set of strange events indeed.

Rumors are flying all over about the happenings after the wedding of 
former Prophetess, Kindrana and Ryokui.  The two seemed to have 
fallen off the face of the earth, not able to be found anywhere within 
Mansion after the reception.  Nobody even remembers seeing them 
leave, but of course the wine was flowing a bit freely and the patrons 
might have been too occupied to notice.  A scullery maid swears that the
Lord Dragon himself whisked the two off for a private honeymoon as 
a wedding present for the two and others have said that they were 
seen ducking behind the waterfall on the edge of the Dragonsworn 
estate.   Who really knows, but it is a fact that both were smiling rather 
widely when they finally emerged from their hiding place.

  <ghelp keyword="Subranks">
    <entry>This is a list of the current subranks and their respective descriptions:

 [&amp;mInformant&amp;n]:
This subrank is reserved for those in The Eyes and the Ears of The Dragonsworn.
Individuals with this subrank are of the sneaky, subtle sort, their presence in the
Dragonsworn is not always known, for they keep to themselves and tend to not
involve themselves in normal affairs, always off on some kind of personal assign-
ment.  Dragonsworn with this rank are also under the command of High Dragon-
sworn Ryokui Shinbaska.

 [&amp;rRogue&amp;n]:
This subrank is a label for those of the Dragonsworn who're either yet to meet
or stay aloof from the whole and are the loner sort, or are in fact, apart from it
in the sense they don't truely have any allegiance to The Prophet/Prophetesses
or the Lord Dragon Reborn.  Those without allegiance, fall under the 'Brigand'
rank or something similar.

 [&amp;cRefugee&amp;n]:
This subrank is for the lost souls who seemingly abandoned everything upon
learning the Dragon had been Reborn.  They commonly wander the streets,
no job, no home, their only possessions the clothes on their backs.  Some have
lost their sense of purpose altogether.

 [&amp;yRecovering&amp;n] and/or [&amp;yInjured&amp;n]:
This subrank is reserved for those wounded during battle, or perhaps recovering
from an illness.  In a sense, it's an In Character background for inactivity.

 [&amp;WSavant&amp;n]:
This tag is for those of the Dragonsworn who've taken to researching that which
we are all so fascinated with, The Dragon Reborn.  Many immerse themselves in
the literature of the Karaethon Cycle, trying to study what has come to pass and
been burned into legends, or perhaps predict what is to come in these uncertain
times.  However, the legends are arcane and hard to decipher.

 [&amp;wSniffer&amp;n]:
This is a very specialized subrank, it's for trackers with a rare talent, and
keen sense of 'smell', if it can be called that.  Sniffers seem to have the
ability to track death itself, able to sense where violence has occured, able
to track evil itself, or more accurately, those tainted by the Dark.  Sniffers
are generally a close guarded secret, as any Aes Sedai would give their right
arm to study such a person.

 [&amp;wBlacksmith&amp;n]:
Subrank for those of the Dragonsworn who work at our forges, crafting all sorts
useful items of iron origin.  They create weapons: swords, daggers, war hammers
and maces etc etc.  They're also responsible for repairs to equipment, armor, and of
course making shoes for our mounts.  The unsung laborers of the Dragonsworn.

 [&amp;wCraftsman&amp;n]:
For those of the Dragonsworn who fashion for us clothing, or make a profession
of leather working.  Producing such things as riding gear, pants, boots, and some
even excell in jewelery crafting, proffering such items as rings, necklaces and
pendants.  Craftsmen can really be anyone who excells at any one profession, but
for the most part, they consist of the aforementioned individuals.

 [&amp;wMedic&amp;n]:
A rarity, although, highly valued, Dragonsworn knowledgable in the ways of
mending wounds, caring for the injured, or perhaps, even a herbalist.  In battle
these individuals are essential and of course, over worked, all the same, they 
may not be as appreciated as they should be.  Soldiers always have something
to gripe about, but the commanders know full well, that without men or women
with the skills of the field medic, it won't be long before your forces, not to men-
tion the morale of your forces, will be depleted.  Off the battlefield, medics are
invaluable to the sick and the slow to recover from wounds, their time consumed
in caring for such individuals.

 [&amp;wSoldier&amp;n]:
 [&amp;wVeteran&amp;n]:
 [&amp;wHonored&amp;n]:
&lt;See ghelp 10 syllabus, these subranks are attached to the 'Guard of The
Prophet/Prophetess' rank&gt;

 [&amp;wRetired&amp;n]:
For Dragonsworn who've decided to take themselves out of active duty, or have
been forced to do so, for one reason or another.

  <ghelp keyword="DS_leadership">
    <entry>The &amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n are led by two main figures:

The Prophet &amp;RM&amp;rasema&amp;n and the Prophetess &amp;RV&amp;raltara&amp;n.
They are of equal standing within the guild as far
as authority and rank.  Both are humble messengers
for the &amp;gLord Dragon&amp;n Reborn and both have their own
following and rarely do they counteract one another.
Yes, true, The &amp;gLord Dragon&amp;n charged Masema to control
the &amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n when last they met, but this is some-
thing he cannot do alone, he trusts and relies on Valtara
as if a sister.  Another leader of the &amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n is the
retired Prophetess &amp;RK&amp;rindrana&amp;n, sister to Valtara.  Though
she is not as actively involved with the duties of leading
the &amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n, she is still to be respected and treated
as an equal to Masema and Valtara.

Leadership within the guild beyond the Prophet/Prophetess
breaks down as far as rank, Guard to the Prophet/Prophetess
being the highest, Companion, obviously, being the lowest.

&amp;y***&amp;nOf course there are &amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n out there who answer to
no one, and follow none but themselves and their own designs.
These &amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n are the problem Masema and Valtara have been
faced with, and ordered to quell by the &amp;gLord Dragon&amp;n himself.

  <ghelp keyword="General_info">
    <entry>&amp;r&amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n&amp;n: General term used for supporters of the &amp;gDragon&amp;n &amp;gReborn&amp;n, usually
by those who either oppose him or at least think to remain neutral.  In fact,
many given that name have never sworn any sort of oath, and it is frequently
applied to brigands as well, some of whom claim the name in the hope that it
will quell resistance.  A great many atrocities have been committed by people
claiming to be &amp;r&amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n&amp;n.

&amp;RProphet&amp;n, the:  More elaborately, the &amp;RProphet&amp;n of the &amp;rLord&amp;n &amp;gDragon&amp;n.  Title claimed
 by &amp;wMasema Dagar&amp;n, a onetime Shienaran soldier, who preaches the rebirth of the
&amp;gDragon&amp;n &amp;gReborn&amp;n.  He has achieved a great following in Ghealdan and northern
Amadicia, in part because of spreading knowledge that the &amp;gDragon&amp;n has indeed
been &amp;gReborn&amp;n and in part because of the extreme brutality his followers visit not
only on anyone who refuses to acknowledge the &amp;gDragon&amp;n &amp;gReborn&amp;n, but on those who 
refuse to acknowledge the authority of the &amp;RProphet&amp;n as the hand and voice of the
&amp;gDragon&amp;n &amp;gReborn&amp;n.

&amp;RProphet&amp;n, the: More formally, the &amp;RProphet&amp;n of the &amp;rLord&amp;n &amp;gDragon&amp;n.  Once known as
&amp;wMasema Dagar&amp;n, a Shienaran soldier, he underwent a revelation and decided that
he had been called to spread the word of the &amp;gDragon's &amp;YRebirth&amp;n.  He believes 
that nothing---&amp;Gnothing!&amp;n---is more important than acknowledging the &amp;gDragon&amp;n
&amp;gReborn&amp;n as the &amp;YLight&amp;n made flesh and being ready when the &amp;gDragon&amp;n &amp;gReborn&amp;n calls,
and he and his followers will use any means to force others to sing the glories
of the &amp;gDragon&amp;n &amp;gReborn&amp;n.  Forsaking any name but &quot;the &amp;RProphet&amp;n,&quot; he has brought
chaos to much of Ghealdan and Amadicia, large parts of which he controls.

    <entry>\c00&amp;GLectures&amp;n

The first lecture is the one on abandoning sin to walk in the Lord
Dragon's Light.  Now, this is just a guide, it isn't required you follow
the exact text in this ghelp file.

Basically one would need to explain how meaningless material things
are, like money, jewelery, property, etc etc.  That none of these things
amount to anything in the grand scheme of things.  That and also,
how sins of the flesh are just that, -sins-, and all they amount to
is self-destructive behavior.

 ***Note:

For further insight into this lecture, it may help to read chapter 39
of book five, The Fires Of Heaven.  The chapter is entitled: Encounters
in Samara.  Within this chapter, Masema rants about a lot of things.

&amp;GPreach&amp;n

Multiplies all players in the room MaxHitpoints by 1.3 for a &quot;pulse&quot;,
meaning if you're Hitpoints are full already, your incredible HP bonus
lasts for a split second basically.  If your HP is down some, you are healed
by the multiplier to a degree however, if not fully.

&amp;WSeek&amp;n

Usage: seek &lt;player/mob name&gt;, will take you right to it as long
as that player or mob isn't hiding their tracks. There are also
times when it is ineffective and the script, 'Hm. There seems
to be no way to that place.', pops up.
When this occurs, it signifies the room you seek is not linked to the
MUD itself, or a wagon is used to enter the room.

&amp;BTail&amp;n

Usage: tail &lt;player/mob name&gt;, this allows you to follow a
player without them seeing the message 'Mr.X starts to follow you.'

    <entry>&amp;y___________&amp;YSyllabus&amp;y___________&amp;n

&amp;gCompanion&amp;n (entrance rank): To pass this rank
to 'Follower', one must merely demonstrate through
words or action to another Dragonsworn that he/she
has joined the Dragonsworn for a purpose, and thus
does not intend to aimlessly wander about in awe.

&amp;gFollower&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'Follower [Saved]'
one must hear a lecture, as well as understand the
lecture's meaning, from any Dragonsworn of higher
rank, on the shedding of sin and wordly possessions.

&amp;gFollower &amp;G[&amp;gSaved&amp;G]&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'Follower [Reformed]'
one must demonstrate to at least one other Dragonsworn
of higher rank, that indeed he/she has shed sin and
material things.

&amp;gFollower &amp;G[&amp;gReformed&amp;G]&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'Follower
[Enlightened]' one must pass a test, this test will be
unannounced to the guildie, it will be a test of temptation.
Either in the way of sins of the flesh, or in the way of
money/material entrapments.  The guildie will not know 
he/she is being tested at the time.

&amp;gFollower &amp;G[&amp;gEnlightened&amp;G]&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'Follower
[Devoted]' one must give the lecture of abandoning sin
to another guildie of lower rank.  

&amp;gFollower &amp;G[&amp;gDevoted&amp;G]&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'Brother/
Sister' one must preach to someone who is not a
member of the Dragonsworn, in an effort to recruit
and/or enlighten the poor soul.  How you take the
person's reactions to your preachings, if they are
negative and unresponsive, will also have a deciding
factor on passing this rank.

&amp;cBrother/Sister&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'High Brother/
Sister' one must preach to a group of nondragonsworn
with Dragonsworn witnesses.  A group meaning at least
three people.  Again, dealing with this group of
unenlightened souls, also plays a -big- factor in raising 
to the next rank.  For instance, if a riot is incited...

&amp;cHigh Brother/High Sister&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'Dragonsworn'
one must recruit a nondragonsworn and have he/she swear the 
Oaths of the Dragonsworn. (see ghelp 10 oaths)

&amp;rDragonsworn&amp;n: To pass this rank to 'High Dragonsworn'
one must complete a specific task/mission ordered by
either Masema, Valtara, or Kindrana.  The task/mission
will vary as per the Prophet's/Prophetess' needs/pref-
erences.

&amp;rHigh Dragonsworn&amp;n: Passing this rank to 'Comrade to the
Prophet/Prophetess' is a matter of showing devout loyalty
to either Masema or Valtara, the active leaders of the 
Dragonsworn.  This rank is not easily achieved, the specifics
of which are completely up to either Masema or Valtara.

&amp;wGuard to the Prophet/Prophetess&amp;n: Skipping over any require-
ments to pass the 'Comrade to the Prophet/Prophetess' rank
here because, really this rank (Guard) is open to any who
prove themselves capable in being a bodyguard/soldier.
Of course it helps to have a high rank, as you will have
already proven yourself previously, and thus someone of a 
lower rank will have a tougher time achieving the rank of
'Guard to the Prophet/Prophetess'.  In essence, any who
wish to attain this rank will be put through a crash course
of the entire syllabus they haven't already completed, and 
will also be required to prove themselves in combat via a 
number of supervised and unsupervised spars.  The number of
unsupervised spars is not limited, though a suggestion of at
least five with other Dragonsworn of equal or higher rank 
is mandated.  The final and sixth spar will be with a 
Dragonsworn of the Prophet's or Prophetess' choosing and will
be supervised by one or the other or both (Masema and Valtara).
Once attaining the 'Guard to the Prophet/Prophetess' rank, 
one can attain higher status through loyal service, such as
Guard to the Prophetess [Soldier] or 'Guard to the Prophet
[Veteran]', these degrees of honor will be handled by Masema
and Valtara themselves, according to their judgement.  This
will mean demonstrating yourself in combat, service, protection,
advisory skills, etc etc.

  <ghelp keyword="Ranks">
    <entry>&amp;Y***&amp;nThis is a list of the assorted ranks that do not adhere to
the syllabus and their respective descriptions.

&amp;gRuffian&amp;n:  A street tough, one who's used to settling matters
with his or her fists rather than words.  One who is likely in a
lot of bar fights, gets arrested more often than not.  Skilled
in the fine (or not so fine) art of brawling.  A 'Ruffian' is quick
to use his/her muscle, but typically, slow to use their wits.

&amp;gBrigand&amp;n:  A raider, a thief, a looter, a plunderer of the innocent.
Your classic bandit, travelling within a band of immoral animals
who live off of what they rob from those they kill.  Brigands are
organized in the sense that they plan their attacks on unwitting
victims and work as a team in their plundering.  They are disorg-
anized in the sense that they really have no loyalties to anyone
but themselves and the bottom line, that being gold or pleasures
of the perverse nature.  In the case of &quot;Dragonsworn&quot; brigands,
they falsely proclaim the Dragon Reborn in the attempt to quell
resistance against their raids.

&amp;gPreacher&amp;n:  The equivilant of the modern day &quot;The End Is Near&quot;
sign wielder/street walker.  This type of Dragonsworn will talk and
talk and talk, even if no one is listening.  They will often wander
city streets and exclaim profound revelations to any passerby
who even hints at having ears.  Their tempers are known to flare
when they are ignored, moreso if they are challenged in their
beliefs.

&amp;gThief&amp;n:  One who practices the devious craft of theft.
One who is quick with his or her hands, as they undoubt-
edly have stolen just about everything they own, if not
the gold and silver they used to pay for it.  Sharp eyes 
and a quick mind would also be something of common
traits, as these nefarious types would need such attributes
to excell in pick pocketing, picking locks and swindling.
Their craft could be anything from perfected, as in using
theft as a profession and even hiring themselves out to
bidders willing to pay the price, or they could easily be
rank amatures who seem to have a knack for getting
caught.  In any case, they need to possess some degree
of stealth and dexterity, thieving takes skill and wits to be
sucessful at it.  Then again, every 'Master Thief' can trace
their career back to it's humble beginnings.

&amp;gLooter&amp;n: A variation on the 'Thief' and 'Brigand' rank in the
sense that they're distinguished by the fact that during battles
with opposing forces (for instance whitecloaks) they would be
more inclined to abandon the fighting to loot the unguarded
manors and homes nearby.  Organized in the sense that, 
these Dragonsworn tend to find one another during battles
and they always agree they'd rather be elsewhere, and thus
come to the conclusion there's booty to be had.  Disorgan-
ized in the sense that, they aren't an actual band, like in the
case of the brigands, who usually tend to stick together in
familiar groups.  They're reckless and cowardly, only able to
muster courage in the face of unarmed bystanders, if it can
be called that at all.

&amp;gArsonist&amp;n:  Dragonsworn with a real flare, so to speak.
They seem to have a thing for fire, perhaps it's a fervor
thing, as in an aspect of their belief that all sinners should
be scorched from the earth.  On the other hand, they could
just get a kick out of watching things (and people) burn.
Cowardly in the sense that, a lot of their &quot;work&quot; is exacted
upon innocent bystanders, or those without the ability to
defend themselves, although not exclusively.

&amp;gRiot Inciter&amp;n:  This could be considered a step up from the
'Preacher' rank in the sense that, not only does a
Dragonsworn of this nature tend to preach rather incess-
antly, but they also seem to have the ability to spark
emotions in large groups of people and thus, incite them
to violence in most cases.  Skilled in the sense that, they
know how to use 'mob mentality' to their own advantage,
they're manipulation artists and good public speakers.
