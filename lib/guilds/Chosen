    <desc>The chosen, or more formally Those Chosen to Rule the World Forever, are the
thirteen of the Great Lord of the Dark's most powerful servants from the
age of legends. At the end of the War of Power, Lews Therin Telamon and the
One Hundred Companions sealed these thirteen men and women up into the Bore
with the Great Lord. Called by those who are foolish enough to think the 
Light bears salvation, &quot;The Forsaken&quot; these men and women are incredibly 
powerful channelers, steeped in the knowledge and skill of the Age of 
Legends.
Still they are not invincible, and not all those that remain are the same
as they were before. Those Chosen currently alive are:
Moridin (Believed to be Formerly Ishamael)
Cyndane (Believed to be Formerly Lanfear)
Osan'gar (Formerly Aginor)
Aran'gar (Formerly Balthamel)
Demandred
Sammael
Moghedien
Graendal
Mesaana
Semirhage

The whereabouts, and even in some cases, the existence of these is not widely
known.

It will be noted, that due their highly developed abilities at stealth
and cunning, it is widely believed that the forsaken are still trapped in
the bore by many. Each one has spent over four hundred years honing their
channeling and manipulative abilities to a razor sharp edge. Many would  
be heros or fools seek to meet with and test themselves against any one  
of the forsaken. This has often led to the premature demise of the said  
hero or fool. At other times, when a forsaken so chooses, this person has 
been said to face a fate worse then death.

    <reqs>The Chosen guild is unlike any other guild. It contains only bookies. 
Due to it's nature that is the Chosen mentioned above, and this same 
application process also applies to &quot;special&quot; characters under the 
influence of the Great Lord, such as Padan Fain and Slayer.
Because Shai'tan wants the best player for any of these Characters at 
all times, you may apply for any Chosen at any time. Please note however
that a Chosen that is already played is going to be harder to get, and
Shai'tan may not choose to have all characters played at any given time.
Players for these characters are chosen at Shai'tan's sole discretion 
with the valued advice of the Storymaster. Shai'tan reserves the right
to remove a player from the character at any time if he feels that their
IC roleplay or OOC behaviour do not meet the standards he requires.
An application should include:
1.) Your real name and e-mail address.
2.) Which character you are applying for.
3.) Why you want to play a chosen in general, and the specific character
you are applying for in specific.
4.) All other characters you have played on Dragon's Fang, including other
5.) How often you believe you will be able to play the character.
6.) What you know, book wise, about the character you are applying for.
7.) Any particular plans or thoughts you have for your first couple of weeks
8.) Any other information you deem relevant to my consideration.

The following are /requirements/ for all chosen applicants:
1.) You must have read ALL the books, if you have not yet acquired the most
2.) You must have, at the time you are applying, at least one fully-guilded character.
3.) You must have had, at some point in the past, at least one fully guilded character who has acquired rank within his or her guild. (i.e. gotten past any training ranks, and, preferably, received a position of responsibility)
