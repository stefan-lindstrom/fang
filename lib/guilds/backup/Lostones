    <desc>&amp;cT&amp;rh&amp;be L&amp;ro&amp;cs&amp;Ct O&amp;cn&amp;re&amp;bs\c00.  We offer a service very few groups offer.
We will get rid of any of your... Problems.  We also obtain objects of
your choice so long as you provide the location of the object to be
obtained.  We also act as an information courier.  If you need information,
we can get it.  All jobs are to be mailed to Morn currently, until
further notice.  Anyone interested in joining our esteemed ranks may
mail Morn, but don&apos;t expect to gain entry into our ranks easily.

*&amp;ROOC Note\c00* We are an assassin/theif/spy club.  We specialize in
