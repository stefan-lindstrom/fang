    <desc>More than just a Guild, the Aiel encompasses an entire Nation. We are the
people east of the Spine of the World; we live within a desert so desolate
that it is called a Waste by others of this world and avoided at all costs.
Yet there we live, hardened by its winds and sands, considered some of the
best fighters anywhere, be it with our spears, knives, bucklers, or simply
our hands, and proud of who we are. We are Aiel, dedicated followers of
Ji&apos;e&apos;toh, one of the strictest and most respected codes of honor. We are
feared by the wetlanders of the rest of the world, and with reason, for
we can run as fast as horses and fight battles at the end of our treks.
If you are born an Aiel you are born to a Nation of some of the best
fighters in the world. Yet even so, we -are- an entire society; just having
a spear does not earn you respect. Some of our most honored members of
society are our Blacksmiths and other craftsmen, who create what we need
to live, and our Wise Ones, who deal in politics, herbs and firstaid, and
at times Channeling and Dreamwalking. Just about anything can be found in
the Aiel guild, if you have the courage to look.

    <entry>Survival - &amp;C(&amp;wFar aldazar din&amp;C)&amp;n Successful use of this skill negates 
hunger and thirst. You&apos;ll never need to buy food again.

Stalk - &amp;C(&amp;wCor darei&amp;C)&amp;n This skill allows you to follow someone without 
their knowledge. They do not get a message when you start tailing 
them, and if they attempt to group all, you will not be grouped. It 
also sets you as sneaking, regardless of whether you have the sneak 
skill.

Handtalk - &amp;C(&amp;wFar Dareis Mai&amp;C)&amp;n Fairly obvious to anyone familiar with 
the series, but handtalk just allows Maidens to communicate using 
handsignals. Basically it is another say command but only people 
with the skill can understand you.

Stab - &amp;C(&amp;wSovin nai&amp;C)&amp;n This is an attack skill. After using it, you must 
wait several rounds before using it again, as with punch and kick. 
However this skill does half again as much damage as one of your 
normal attacks.

Rage - &amp;C(&amp;wSiswai&apos;aman&amp;C)&amp;n Ups your hit/dam for some time, as you take on 
some fanaticism for the car&apos;a&apos;carn. Sets you !flee as well.

Run - &amp;C(&amp;wRahien sorei&amp;C)&amp;n Lets you start running in a direction you 
specify until you reach a room with more than 2 exits, or until you 
hit a closed door.

Critical hit - &amp;C(&amp;wShae&apos;en m&apos;taal&amp;C)&amp;n Offers the chance of doubling the
damage you give on your opening attack.

Infravision - &amp;C(&amp;wSeia doon&amp;C)&amp;n lets you see in the dark. 

Traction - &amp;C(&amp;wHama n&apos;dore&amp;C)&amp;n cuts the trip and bash success against you 
in half.  In other words, people cannot use these skills very well 
against you.

Rally - &amp;C(&amp;wAethon dor&amp;C)&amp;n It calls up to 3 aethon dor npc mobs to your 
aid.

Pound - &amp;C(&amp;wCraftsman&amp;C)&amp;n an extra attack-skill in battle (like kick and
punch).

Herbmastery - &amp;C(&amp;wWise Ones&amp;C)&amp;n lets you heal hps on yourself and others.

Peace - &amp;C(&amp;wWise Ones&amp;C)&amp;n makes aggressive mobs ignore you.


Camouflage - an advanced form of hide, it lets you stay hidden in a
room while you talk, emote, social, and everything. To remove it,
you have to either move a direction or type vis.

Endurance - doubles time between needing to eat and drink.

Speardance - is a backstab skill that also gives a +1 extra attack.

Advanced healing - &amp;C(&amp;wFor channeling Wise Ones&amp;C)&amp;n See help advanced 
healing.

Veil - Increases your Dexterity, hitroll and damroll by 15%.

    <entry>&amp;ySpear Syllabus&amp;n

When Aiel first start their lives, they are born into a society filled
with battle. The little boys and girls always have dulled spears to run
around with (though girls often carry dolls too). Around age 10, an Aiel
may hold his first real spear and begin to train. Age 16 is the earliest
he may join a Society, 18-22 the most common, though it will take however
long until the leaders deem him ready. At that point, the Aiel may become
one of the best Spears in the Society or even the Nation. Many positions
like First Spear or leadership roles like Sept Chief and Society Leader
open up to the warriors should they be able to prove themselves. A rank
like First Spear only requires that an Aiel can beat any other challengers,
while a leadership role also requires talent of intellect. The Dance is
the lifestyle of the Aiel; he would as soon give his life than his weapons.

&amp;YNOTE&amp;y:&amp;n With the small playerbase, all warrior Aiel will begin
immediately at novice Spear rank. He can then rise up to middling, and
finally to Honored, where he is deemed a truly hardy warrior. Once at
Honored, he can pursue the other Spear ranks available at the end of this
syllabus.

First Steps: &amp;yMarath&apos;siswai&amp;n
RP Lesson: How to Lose
Choose a second primary weapon &amp;Y(&amp;yfirst is spear&amp;Y)&amp;n from:
bow, knife, buckler, unarmed &amp;Y(&amp;ymartial arts&amp;Y)&amp;n
Understand your two weapons from an Aiel standpoint and be able to explain
both if asked.
Know the Aiel Dances
Two Spars with anyone, wetlander or aiel

Final Steps: &amp;ySpear&amp;n
Three Spars: 1 with Aiel, 1 with wetlander, third with either.
Make up your own Dance to be approved by the GL.
Teach at least two new marath&apos;siswai to Spear status &amp;Y(&amp;yif applicable;&amp;n 
&amp;yotherwise 2 more spars with anyone&amp;Y)&amp;n
One real time RP fight, or intense Aiel knowledge pertaining to fighting.

Extra Ranks: &amp;yHonored&amp;n
First Spear - defeat all challengers in your Society or show proficient
general RP for a certain time &amp;Y(&amp;yapplicable only if at least 3 in Society&amp;Y)&amp;n.
Society Leader - show proficient leadership and Aiel knowledge &amp;Y(&amp;yalso&amp;n
&amp;yapplicable only if at least 3 aiel in the Society&amp;Y)&amp;n
Sept and Clan Chief: show proficient leadership, aiel knowledge, and
have a good active history in the guild.

&amp;yExtras Throughout Training:&amp;n
secondary weapon choice:
Bow - lessons on it and test of proficiency to earn Archery
Knife - lessons on it and proficiency test for prestige and Throw.
Unarmed - Lessons on it and multiple spars to earn Unarmed Combat
Buckler - lessons on it with spear, mult. spars, to earn Spearmaster.

You can also learn any of these after Honored without having chosen that
weapon as your proficiency.

Skills that are good to get:
sneak, track, hide tracks, disarm, trip, stun, fourth attack
&amp;Y(&amp;yNOTE: you will never need hide or backstab&amp;Y)&amp;n

    <entry>&amp;WWise One Syllabus&amp;n

The Wise Ones consider themselves the real decision makers of the Aiel
Nation. Much like the Woman&apos;s Circle of Emond&apos;s Field, these women
dabble quite often in the affairs of the Chiefs they work with, be it in
a Clan or simply a Sept. They are highly respected, as much or more
than Chiefs (mostly because they demand it with fists on hips and cold
stares, or possibly even ear pulling), but also sometimes regarded
as meddlers. The Wise Ones are also like Wisdoms of wetland cities.
They have extensive knowledge of all plants and animals in the Three-fold
Land, and can heal with skill. Some Wise Ones also know how to channel. 
Although channeling is almost never performed, the Wise Ones have good
skill in that as well, and do train in it. They know the danger of an 
untrained wilder, and so any woman found to have the spark must become
a Wise One, even against her will. Wise Ones never take place in battles.
They could walk straight across a field of warriors and not get touched.
In fact, that is precisely what most do: head for their opponent&apos;s camp
to have tea with the Wise Ones there. A Wise One seems to be the best
person to go to for news and rumors within the Nation. She can speak with
other Wise Ones halfway across the sands in her dreams. Not all Wise Ones
have the Dream talent, but those that do keep the information &quot;highway&quot; 
running.;

&amp;WBecoming a Wise One...&amp;n

&amp;yAs An Aiel/Maiden&amp;Y:&amp;n

&amp;YNOTES&amp;y:&amp;n
- The RP requirements are necessary. However, there is a 4 week no-action
policy. If you cannot get a lesson or RP with a Wise One when it is
required of you to be with her for the duration of 4 straight weeks,
simply mail the GL and the GL will set up a time to meet with you, ask
you a few questions, and see if you understand enough to simply become
a Wise One. This no-action policy only works if there are either no
Wise Ones available or none active. It is up to you, the Apprentice,
to alert the GL if there is inactivity among the WO, and also up to
you to notify the GL that it has been 4 weeks. The GL will not be
keeping such a constant eye on you that she will know you can&apos;t find
lessons.

    <entry>Craftsman Syllabus:

The Craft side of the Aiel Nation perhaps did not get mentioned half
so much as the warrior side, but it is no less important. The Aiel
society is a very complete one. They depend on no outside means like
some wetland countries do for food or money or building material,
though they do enjoy trading for fine silks and carpets and books.
In Aiel society, the Blacksmith is the most honored craftsman of
them all, because he creates the weapons and armor for the Spears. To
a society based on battle, that is very important. However, no nation
can live without other sorts of trades, including silversmiths,
potters, jewelers, and more. Those fall under the term Craftsmen, and
are also honored for their work. Then there are the Aiel who make it
their business to trade with the visiting merchants. All Aiel can
trade for a good they want, but the Trader is best at getting materials
from wetlanders and Aiel alike for anyone who needs anything. The least
mentioned, and perhaps the most basic but still important task in the
Aiel society is the Herder who keeps track of the zemai crops and the
ewes, goats, and cattle.

  <ghelp keyword="Societies">
    <entry>This is a list of all the Societies and an idea of what they do. Only
some Societies were ever fully developed in the books, so this is to
the best of my knowledge.

&amp;rAethan Dor&amp;n - The Red Shields are considered the Police force of
the Nation. They often patrol and always bring up legalities of Ji&apos;e&apos;toh
or whatever is pertinent to the conversation. They make very good
City Patrol representatives, and are always good to have as friends.

&amp;WC&amp;wo&amp;kr Dar&amp;we&amp;Wi&amp;n - The Night Spears are just as their name sounds. They
function very well at night, make wonderful scouts or sentries,
and are some of the best at ambushing and sneaking around.

&amp;wD&amp;Cu&amp;ca&amp;Bd&amp;bhe Mahd&amp;Bi&amp;c&apos;&amp;Ci&amp;wn&amp;n - The Water Seekers are good scouts and escorts. They 
know the land they travel, especially where to find the right spots for 
rest sites; places close to food and water.

&amp;rFar &amp;kA&amp;wl&amp;Wdaz&amp;wa&amp;kr &amp;rDin&amp;n - The Brothers of the Eagle are the loners of the 
Nation, much preferring a day alone to a game of Flip. They tend to be 
quieter and more distanced from others, but also know more about the
animals and areas of the lands. They are some of the best hunters.

&amp;kF&amp;ca&amp;wr Dareis &amp;wM&amp;ca&amp;ki&amp;n - Maidens of the Spear is the only Society a woman may 
join. However, she would not want to join any other. This Society is 
filled with camaraderie and good times, though almost all of this is 
hidden from the others in the Nation. Aside from the True Bloods, the 
Maidens take Honor most seriously. To a Maiden, you are wed to the 
spear, not any man. Maidens make great scouts, though among them, there 
is much diversity of talent.

&amp;WH&amp;wa&amp;km&amp;wa N&apos;D&amp;ko&amp;wr&amp;We&amp;n - The Mountain Dancers know the terrain and how to adapt 
best to it. They are some of the most proficient trackers and climbers 
and can always find a trail to or around an obstacle. Sure of foot, they 
make good middle attackers in a formation to contain the enemy.

&amp;YR&amp;ya&amp;Yh&amp;yi&amp;Ye&amp;yn &amp;YS&amp;yo&amp;Yr&amp;ye&amp;Yi&amp;n - The Dawn Runners are the messengers of the Nation. They 
have the highest endurance and can run great distances at some of the 
highest speeds of all Aiel.

&amp;kSe&amp;wi&amp;ka Do&amp;wo&amp;kn&amp;n - The Black Eyes make some of the best sentries, both day and 
night, and best eyes for seeing objects or people a long distance away. 
When they fight, the dance tends to be silent and ruthless.

&amp;kS&amp;wh&amp;ka&amp;w&apos;&amp;km&amp;wa&amp;kd &amp;wC&amp;ko&amp;wn&amp;kd&amp;we&amp;n - By far the swiftest both of foot and tongue, the Thunder 
Walkers make good first attackers, usually in a surprise flanking 
maneuver or dead on blitz, because they can get in and out quickly. 
However, though they have the best jokes, they do not last long in 
endurance tests.

&amp;yShae&amp;Y&apos;&amp;yen M&amp;Y&apos;&amp;ytaal&amp;n - Often the brunt of jokes, the Stone Dogs are notorious
for being dimwitted and thick-skulled. They make up the rear guard of an 
attack - the base of any formation. They also refuse to flee from a 
fight, in fact take an oath on it.

&amp;rS&amp;ko&amp;rv&amp;ki&amp;rn &amp;rN&amp;ka&amp;ri&amp;r&amp;n - Instead of the Spear, the Knife Hands prefer closer combat.
They make good side attackers and ambushers, best able to get
in close before the enemy realizes it. They are by far the best 
bodyguards, and also manage to have the best rough tongues, though 
Maidens come close to matching their insults.

&amp;RT&amp;rain Shari&amp;n - By far the most serious with Ji&apos;e&apos;toh, the True Bloods
know it better than anyone. They feel that following this Honor as
strictly as possible is the most important thing of daily life.

&amp;WS&amp;ki&amp;ws&amp;kw&amp;Wa&amp;wi&amp;k&apos;&amp;wa&amp;Wm&amp;wa&amp;kn&amp;n - The Spears of the Dragon is not an actual Society, but is 
what the Aiel who wear headbands with the Aes Sedai symbol have named 
themselves. Other Aiel refuse to acknowledge it exists, preferring to 
think of the Aiel in question as still part of his older Society. Not a 
single Maiden will join, as they already hold the Car&apos;a&apos;carn&apos;s honor, 
something the Siswai hunger for. A Siswai&apos;aman is someone who has grown
to be so fervent in wanting to honor Rand al&apos;Thor.

    <entry>&amp;yM&amp;we&amp;Wr&amp;wa&amp;Y&apos;&amp;wd&amp;Wi&amp;wn&amp;n - Not a Society either, this is what an Aiel is known as when
he or she loses or quits a Society due to the Bleakness. Many such 
Brotherless have now joined the Shaido because their Societies refused
to let them go as honorable Aiel.
