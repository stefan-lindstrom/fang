&amp;W(continued from ghelp 50 sed_role)&amp;n

&amp;WBe confident.&amp;n
Try to always act sure of yourself. In the books, Aes Sedai rarely have 
to channel to impose their will. Issue suggestions in such a way that 
it is clear that although they are in the polite form of a request, 
they are most definitely orders. Act mildly surprised if your commands, 
suddenly transformed into incredibly reasonable suggestions, are not 
followed. Make it clear from your attitude, not your words, that not 
obeying you is merely an act of childishness. Try to never outwardly 
show fear. There were many scenes in the books of Aes Sedai calmly, 
nonchalantly facing Asha&apos;man. Then, once they were alone, quickly 
confiding in their sisters that those men made them want to scream in 
terror. To paraphrase a quote from a bad western movie, &quot;Nothing 
unsettles a man more than you standing your ground and looking him in 
the eye when every ounce of common sense says you should be running 
like hell.&quot; If this confidence annoys someone to the point that he 
points out exactly how outmatched you are, simply smile mysteriously as 
if you know something he does not. Perhaps even confirm that he is 
correct and smile even more. 
.
&amp;cThe Asha&apos;man sneers disdainfully at the small woman and spits out in an 
arrogant tone,&quot;I have you shielded, Aes Sedai. There is no way you can 
free yourself.&quot;&amp;n 
.
&amp;cJane&apos;s cheek dimples as an amused smile slowly spreads across her face. 
She presses tentatively against the shield once, then stops, her smile 
growing even more amused. Softly, she replies,&quot;It would certainly seem 
that you have the upper hand.&quot; She seems barely able to suppress a 
chuckle.&amp;n 
.
Inside, Jane is likely thinking to herself, &quot;Oh light! Someone please 
help me!!!&quot; Years of Aes Sedai training enables her to outwardly keep 
her calm, even if she does feel like wetting herself. 
.
&amp;WTake charge.&amp;n
Aes Sedai are important. They are revered, respected and even feared. 
They are used to being listened to and of being in charge. Use this. 
Certainly, you would not do this if you are hiding your identity, but 
if you are in a situation where you are already known to be Aes Sedai 
and there is turmoil, you are not only allowed, but almost expected, to 
step in and handle the situation. Also, never explain yourself or your 
actions unless you absolutely must. Express annoyance if you do have to 
explain. Even then, do not fully explain. It is hard to be mysterious 
if you tell everyone exactly what you are up to all the time.

  <ghelp keyword="sed_role">
    <entry>
&amp;gACTING THE PART&amp;n
.
It should be impressed upon the student that Aes Sedai are viewed as 
mysterious, confident, cryptic, regal and wise. The following tips are 
just examples of little tricks one can use to try to portray a 
character who has more life experience and knowledge than it would ever 
be possible for a player to gain. Each player will, or should, develope 
her own personal style. These are just some, not all, of the possible 
ways one can attempt to appear Sedai-like. 
.
&amp;WLie without lying.&amp;n
Be extremely careful to never lie. Aes Sedai are world famous for 
making people believe totally incorrect things without ever lying. One 
of the easiest methods of doing this is to simply not correct someone 
else when they make a false statement. Allowing them to continue to 
believe something you know to be untrue is not lying. Having someone 
else lie for you is another tried and true lesson. Some think that 
warders are vital more for this than for the protection their swords 
offer. Ordering someone to tell a lie is not lying yourself. 
.
&amp;cJoe steps forward and gestures towards Jane as he says,&quot;Her name is 
Liersa.&quot;&amp;n 
.
A more advanced form of this concept is convincing, or having someone 
else convince, another Aes Sedai that something is true when it is not. 
An Aes Sedai can be wrong, but she cannot speak statements she knows to 
be untrue. In the books, many Rebel Sedai are spreading the lies that 
the Red Ajah helped Logain rise to power as a false Dragon. They are 
not violating their Oaths, because they believe it, having been told by 
someone they think cannot lie. 
.
Avoid directly answering questions. If someone asks your name and you 
wish them not to know it, do not respond with &quot;I am [whoever].&quot; Giving 
someone permission to do something is not lying, so you could respond, 
&quot;You may call me [insert whatever pseudonym you like].&quot; Feel free to 
ignore questions posed to you and then make unrelated statements. An 
example from the books would be when Moiraine was asked why she was in 
the Two Rivers. The truthful answer to the question would have been, &quot;I 
am seeking the Dragon Reborn.&quot; She ignored that question however and 
simply made the statement, &quot;I am interested in old stories.&quot; Since she 
cannot lie, it is a true statement that she is interested in old 
stories. Had she answered the question with that statement by saying 
something such as, &quot;I am here for the sole purpose of learning the old 
stories of your region.&quot; That would have been a lie. 
.
Preparation is one of the keys. If you are going on a mission, the 
secrecy of which is vital, have a secondary goal as well. For example, 
if you are going to Cairhien to spy on the Dragon Reborn, do more than 
one thing with the trip. There is a world famous library in the city. 
Plan to visit it. Then, when asked why you are in the city, you can 
truthfully respond, &quot;I plan to visit the Royal Library.&quot; 
.
Make a habit of answering in such a manner even when you are not trying 
to misdirect. If people spend a lot of time carefully considering your 
exact wording on every statement, there is more possibility of the 
important ones slipping through. Even if you are simply in the garden 
to look at the flowers, couching it in evasive terms will help in the 
long run, and make you seem more like an Aes Sedai. &quot;Aren&apos;t these 
flowers lovely?&quot; The suspicious will naturally assume that you are 
hiding some other agenda by the evasive answer. It helps keep them off 
balance. 
.
If there is simply no way to truthfully respond to an uncomfortable 
question with misdirection, do not answer. Ignore it and respond with a 
question of your own. For example, if you are trying to steal the crown 
jewels and are asked, &quot;Why are you here in the palace?&quot; You could 
respond,&quot;Have you seen my ink pen?&quot; Questions are never lies. And of 
course, there is always,&quot;I am an Aes Sedai, child. I am not here to be 
interrogated by such as you.&quot;

&amp;gPOST-RAISING LECTURES&amp;n
.
There are some bits of knowledge that women simply are not entrusted 
with until they attain the shawl. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&amp;WIgnoring Heat and Cold:&amp;n
Aes Sedai are rarely seen to sweat. It takes great stress to disturb 
their concentration enough to cause them to lose control to that point. 
They also do not seem to be touched by the cold. It is not a thing of 
the power, simply a trick of the mind. Exactly how this is done is 
never explained, but that matters little. One doesn&apos;t need to know how 
to do it, just how to emote it. 
.
Jane turns her cool gaze on the man who is sweating and nervously 
shifting his weight from one foot to the other. She arches an eyebrow 
at him, her own face dry, the heat seemingly not affecting her. 
Imperiously, she asks,&quot;Is there any particular reason you are nervous?&quot; 
.
&amp;WThe Kin:&amp;n
Many of the girls who come to the Tower aren&apos;t suitable for raising to 
the shawl and are sent away with a warning never to channel again. 
There are also girls who aren&apos;t accepted for training because they are 
considered too old, and there are girls who run away. Whilst tracking 
down runaways, Aes Sedai discovered a secret group of women known only 
as the Kin, who took in such girls. They have their base in Ebou Dar 
and focus their talents on Healing. They believe firmly that their 
secret is still intact and Aes Sedai are ignorant of their presence, 
but infact the Kin are simply ignored. It is considered better to have 
the women grouped together and guided than alone in the world. That is 
really the extent of what the Aes Sedai know of the Kin. Most of the 
information on them in the books is stuff that most Aes Sedai simply 
would not believe. (We can be damn arrogant sometimes.) 
.
&amp;WBeing Turned:&amp;n
The ability to channel is a great tool to be used against the Shadow in 
service to the Light. It is also a weakness. This is not normally told 
to Aes Sedai until after they are raised to the Shawl, but it is 
possible for thirteen dreadlords channeling through thirteen myrrdraal 
to turn a channeler to the Shadow against his or her will. 
.
If anyone notices anything blatant that should be known by Aes Sedai 
but that is not represented anywhere in the syllabus, she should inform 
the GLs of that. She will be rewarded with quest points.

  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="restricted">
    <entry>
&amp;gRESTRICTED WEAVES&amp;n
.
These weaves are rediscovered lost Talents or newly discovered 
abilities for the most part. Some of them are things that some Aes 
Sedai know, but have not bothered to share with others. The GLs will be 
the final arbiters on whether one can obtain these weaves. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&amp;WTravelling:&amp;n This is a complex weave of Spirit that requires great 
strength in the one power to use. Fewer than one Aes Sedai in ten has 
the ability to form a gate of useable size. Luckily, there are over 
four hundred full Aes Sedai in Salidar, so most of the player 
characters can be among that small percentage that does have the 
strength. We have no book reference for the Tower, but the percentage 
should be the same. The rules on obtaining this weave differ slightly 
in the two guilds. One should speak to the GL of her particular guild 
for specifics on acquiring the weave. This intricate weave of spirit is 
used to form a similarity. Basically, the spot occupied by the weave is 
altered to make it more and more similar to the destination one is 
trying to reach until they are the same spot, at which point, the 
gateway will open. One must know the departure point very well in order
 to Travel from it. This familiarity requires several hours in the 
place, although the time will vary slightly from person to person and 
is reduced a good deal (about half) by holding the Power the entire 
time. The edges of the gateway are incredibly sharp and will cut 
through anything in their way or that passes through them. Therefore, 
it is very dangerous to gate into a highly populated area. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves threads of Spirit into a complex weave as she concentrates 
on her destination. Abruptly, a slash of light appears and rapidly 
widens into a sharp-edged hole in the air through which can be seen a 
quiet forest glade.&amp;n 
.
&amp;WInvisibility:&amp;n This weave is a screen of Air and Spirit used to bend 
light around the target causing it to be unseen. It should be noted 
that the weave is anchored to a place, not a person, and provides 
invisibility only if the person does not move out of the protected 
area. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves a screen of Air laced with Spirit and gradually reshapes it 
into a dome over the campsite, rendering the small group invisible to 
all outside the weave.&amp;n 
.
&amp;YHeal Gentling/Stilling:&amp;n If one delves a person who has been gentled or 
stilled, she will something inside them that seems to have been cut, 
leaving a gap. If the ends are held with Spirit, the gap can be bridged 
with Fire, restoring the link and allowing the person to channel again. 
This description is purposely vague, as the current MUD policy requires 
that a person apply for this ability and that they have already 
previously been approved for an Affinity for Healing. Part of the 
application process requires that the person show strong understanding 
of the ability. It would hardly be fair to the application process to 
provide all the information for the weave here. 
.
&amp;CEavesdropping:&amp;n A proving thread of Air slightly enhanced with Spirit 
forms a conduit for conducting sound. It can be slipped under the edge 
of a door and then the end formed into a sort of parabolic shape to 
catch the sounds or attached to a window to pick up the vibrations from 
the room. Alternately, it can be attached to a ward against 
eavesdropping instead of a window. The person who wove the ward would 
have to be very much occupied with other things to not notice this last 
type of eavesdropping, though. Some Aes Sedai have different variations 
on this weave. Moiraine, for example, uses a small gemstone as a focus 
for the weave. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves a slender thread of Air lightly touched with Spirit and 
presses it against the pane of the window. A frown of concentration 
creases her brow as she listens to the conversation in the other room.&amp;n

  <ghelp keyword="common_2">
    <entry>
&amp;W(continued from ghelp 50 common_weaves)&amp;n

&amp;CLightning:&amp;n The Aes Sedai who know this weave likely only learn the form 
of it and do not understand the science involved, but the weave is 
composed of Air laced liberally with Fire. The Air is used to stimulate 
air molecules and build up static. Fire is used to greatly increase the 
energy in this process. The difficulty of this weave varies depending 
on the existing conditions. Most women lack the strength to do this out 
of a cloudless sky, although one with a strong Talent for Cloud Dancing 
would find it less difficult. Even if conditions are stormy, this is 
one of those operations that is quite fatiguing. This weave can be 
devastating against closely packed units of troops, not just for the 
destructive ability, but also for the panic it can cause. Against 
single targets, it is much less useful, as it is not very accurate and 
extremely difficult to aim with precision. 
.
&amp;cJane leans out over the parapet, eyes narrowing as she surveys the 
besieging troops. Weaving thick flows of entwined Fire and Air, she 
calls a forked bolt of lightning down into the thickest concentration 
of milling Trollocs, closing her eyes just as she completes the weave 
to avoid the flash. As she releases Saidar, she seems almost to 
deflate, shoulders sagging wearily, the thunder and screams of the 
troops drowning out her tired sigh.&amp;n 
.
&amp;WToken:&amp;n This is a weave of Spirit used to keep track of a target. It 
requires giving them an item, metal seems to work best, and weaving 
Spirit through both the item and the target to form an affinity. After 
this, as long as the target keeps the item, the Aes Sedai can sense the 
target&apos;s general direction and distance, much as one can with one&apos;s 
warder. As a side effect of the weave, most targets will have an 
unconscious tendency to keep the item with them. 
.
&amp;cJane hands Joe a small, intricately engraved silver medallion and 
says,&quot;I would like for you to have this.&quot; As he takes the item, she 
sends thin, complexly woven threads of Spirit through both the 
medallion and the man, forming a sort of bond between the three of 
them.&amp;n

    <entry>
&amp;gCOMMON WEAVES&amp;n
.
The purpose of this document is to list some of the more common weaves 
that would be taught to Aes Sedai after they are raised to the shawl. 
While most Accepted, especially the more advanced ones, would have the 
skill and facility to learn these weaves, they are not taught to them 
for various reasons. The combat weaves are not taught to them because 
they have not sworn the Oaths yet. Some of them are simply not needed 
by women cloistered in the Tower and unable to roam the world on their 
own and yet others require a certain level of responsibility. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&amp;WGentling/Stilling:&amp;n This is a Spirit weave very similar to the Shield 
weave. The difference is that instead of being a blunt wedge of Spirit, 
the gentling weave is tightened to a sharp edge and instead of just 
pushing the target away from the One Power, it permanently cuts them 
off from it. It takes a massive strength advantage to successfully use 
this weave against someone. In practice, it is unlikely that a single 
player character can ever successfully use this weave against another. 
Tower Tradition calls for a circle of thirteen to perform all gentlings 
or stillings. 
.
&amp;cJane draws in more power from the twelve women linked to her and stares 
down at the bound and shielded man kneeling in the center of their 
circle. With an almost sympathetic look on her face, she weaves thick 
flows of Spirit, gradually tightening them until they form a wedge with 
a razor-like sharp edge. In a motion similar to a striking viper, she 
brings the weave down sharply on the man&apos;s connection to tainted 
Saidin, forever severing him from the Source.&amp;n 
.
&amp;WMask of Mirrors:&amp;n This weave causes the illusion that the weaver is 
growing. It should be used sparingly as it is incredibly unsubtle. The 
only real use of this weave is to frighten and impress and remind 
people that the weaver is indeed an Aes Sedai and therefore a force to 
be reckoned with. It should be noted that other uses of Saidar will see 
the weave, spoiling the illusion for them. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves a complex shell of Air and Spirit around herself. Gradually 
she adds strength to the weave, expanding it, creating the illusion 
that she is growing until she appears to be close to fifty feet tall 
and staring the guard on the wall straight in the eye.&amp;n 
.
&amp;RFireball:&amp;n This weave consists of a thin shell of Air, formed into a 
hollow sphere to contain a mass of jumbled-up flows of Fire. The entire 
construct is sent hurtling towards the target, and upon reaching a 
close enough proximity, the Air is tightened up to bring it into close 
association with the Fire, thereby bringing about a concussive blast of 
flame and heat sufficient to burn a cluster of attackers and throw them 
violently about. Due to the fairly complex nature of the weaving, and 
to its concussive traits, it is best used at a distance to give time to 
weave it properly and to avoid injury to oneself. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves a chaotic jumble of threads of Fire surrounded by a hollow 
shell of Air. She hurls it down the slope at the charging Trollocs, her 
fist tightening in time with the shell of Air just as the weave reaches 
the creatures. The flaming missile suddenly erupts into a concussive 
burst of flame, the blast knocking several of the trollocs over and 
burning many others.&amp;n

&amp;gANGREAL&amp;n
.
&amp;WAngreal:&amp;n
Angreal are objects that allow a channeler to safely draw more of the 
One Power than she normally can. In addition to increasing how much 
power she can hold, an angreal acts as a buffer to help prevent 
overdrawing. Angreal are specific to either Saidar or Saidin. If one 
can be used by a woman, then it will be useless to a man and vice 
versa. The angreal provided in the guild equipment are entirely OOC. If 
one would like information on acquiring an IC angreal, she should speak 
to the IMM GL for the current policies and status of items of the 
Power. 
.
In order to use an angreal, a woman would embrace almost as normal, 
except that she would draw Saidar through the angreal instead of 
directly. In the books, it is never really described more clearly than 
this. In roleplay, this is incredibly simple. An example: 
.
&amp;cJane holds the small heartstone rose in the palm of her hand and 
embraces the One Power, drawing Saidar through the rose. The golden 
glow springs up immediately around her, much brighter than usual as she 
holds well more Power than she can unaided.&amp;n 
.
Identifying angreal is not complex. If a woman trained in channeling 
touches a female angreal, she will instantly know its nature. There is 
no known way for her to identify a male angreal, however. 
.
&amp;WSa&apos;angreal:&amp;n
Sa&apos;angreal are similar to angreal, but much more powerful. A Sa&apos;angreal 
would allow a woman to hold as much more power than an angreal as an 
angreal would allow her to hold over being unaided. They are used in 
exactly the same manner. 
.
&amp;WTer&apos;angreal:&amp;n
Instead of aiding a channeler in using the Power, ter&apos;angreal are 
designed to perform specific tasks. Some of them work only for men, 
some only for women, some for both, and some do not require channeling 
ability at all. An incredibly wide range of functions can be performed 
with ter&apos;angreal. This causes it to be extremely dangerous to tinker 
with one if its function is not understood. Women have been injured, 
stilled or even killed by experimenting on strange ter&apos;angreal.

  <ghelp keyword="linking">
    <entry>
&amp;gLINKING&amp;n
.
Linking is a method where Aes Sedai can combine their strengths. It is 
not very efficient, but in cases where raw strength is important, it 
can be very useful. After scouring the web for theories and models on 
the workings of the One Power, the author has discovered that the 
consensus seems to be that about thirty percent of the total strength 
of the linked members is lost. To clarify, the total strength seems to 
be the leader of the circle plus around seventy percent of the total of 
the rest of the circle. 
.
In order to link, one person must lead the circle. She begins by 
embracing the source. Any others who are to join the circle prepare to 
embrace, but hold themselves just at the point of readiness, not 
actually embracing. The leader of the circle then embraces through 
them, drawing them into the link. Up to thirteen women can join in this 
method. A circle of thirteen would be strong enough to easily shield or 
gentle even the Dragon. 
.
It is important to note that only the leader of a circle can do any 
active channeling. The other members are essentially helpless, only 
able to point out things to the leader that need her attention. 
Feelings experienced while linked are similar to those in the bond, 
although there are some differences. If a member of the link is 
injured, it will be felt by the other members of the link. If a member 
is rended unconscious, the shock will almost certainly shatter the 
link, likely rendering other members of the link unconscious as well. 
If a member of the link is killed, it would be unlikely for any members 
to remain conscious, and the trauma could conceivable kill another of 
the weaker members.

  <ghelp keyword="knotting">
    <entry>
&amp;gKNOTTING/UNKNOTTING&amp;n
.
&amp;WKnotting:&amp;n
Knotting or tying a weave is a method whereby a weave can be left in 
existance without the need for the weaver to maintain it. The name 
comes from the fact that the threads of the One Power used in the weave 
are tied into knots so the structure will support itself. In most 
cases, the knots are rather simple, although it is possible to tie more 
elaborate knots to prevent someone else from untying to weave or at 
least to make it more difficult for them. In roleplay, this is very 
simple. You just do it. A couple of examples: 
.
&amp;cJane channels flows of Air, spinning them into a tighly spun plate to 
form a hard barrier to shelter the small alcove from random arrows. 
Deftly she ties the weave off and turns to concentrate on the wounded 
man huddling beside her.&amp;n 
.
&amp;cJane smiles grimly as the shield of Spirit slides into place, 
separating the Accepted from the True Source. Her smile turns to a 
frown of concentration as she ties the weave in an elaborate knot. As 
she releases Saidar, she turns to the other student and says,&quot;Practice 
untying weaves. That shield should keep you busy and out of trouble for 
hours.&quot;&amp;n 
.
&amp;WUnknotting:&amp;n
This consists of using flows of Spirit to knock or pick apart the knot 
holding a weave in place. One method is to use the fine thread of 
Spirit to untie the knot, or pick it apart much like one would use his 
fingernails on a knot in a piece of string. Another method is to insert 
a thin thread of Spirit inside the knot and &quot;flex&quot; it, shattering the 
knot. The second method only works on simple knots. A complex knot 
would require slowly and carefully untying it. It should be noted that 
one can only untie weaves she can see. A woman would be unable to 
unknot a weave made of Saidin, or one made by a man and a woman linked. 
Examples: 
.
&amp;cJane examines the knotted weave for a moment, then embraces Saidar. She 
spins out a very fine thread of Spirit and slowly worms it inside the 
knot. Once it is fully inside, she pulses more strength into the 
thread, expanding it as if flexing a muscle hard. The knot shatters and 
the weave it held unravels.&amp;n 
.
&amp;cJane channels, snaking out a fine thread of Spirit and uses it to 
slowly pick apart the knot on the Airwall weave. As she finally works 
the knot apart, she steps back and folds her hands together at her 
waist, smiling serenel as she watches the weave dissipate.&amp;n

  <ghelp keyword="weather_control">
    <entry>
&amp;gWEATHER CONTROL&amp;n
.
Aes Sedai do not normally interfere with the weather unless there is 
dire need, as any change will have repercussions and far-reaching, 
unpredictable effects. For example, if the weather were manipulated to 
bring rain to one region in need of it, another region would likely 
suffer an unnatural dry spell. The problem is a bit more serious than 
that, though. It is not predictable enough for the decision to be about 
trading the prosperity of one region for that of another. Changing the 
weather to provide favorable prevailing winds to speed the Amyrlin&apos;s 
journey upriver, could easily cause unwanted droughts or flooding in 
totally unexpected places. (paraphrased from a partially remembered 
example from &amp;uThe Great Hunt&amp;n) 
.
Weather control is mostly about changing the prevailing winds, humidity 
and air pressure. The weaves involved are, for the most part, Air or 
Air and Water. Calling lightning will be addressed in the weaves taught 
after raising to the shawl. 
.
Manipulating the weather is very fatiguing. It is a slow process 
sometimes requiring hours of weaving flows of Air high into the 
atmosphere. If one does not have a natural facility for this, it can 
take several women linked or working in conjunction. Part of the 
difficulty is that great care must be taken. The affects the change 
will have on other weather is a disturbing enough prospect, but 
careless or hasty manipulation can result in accidents that cause 
violent storms. 
.
&amp;WNOTE:&amp;n Because of the non-interference trend, much of the facility 
with weather control or Cloud Dancing, as the Talent is sometimes 
called, has been lost. An example of this from the series would be how 
amazed Elayne was at how much more the Windfinders knew of working with 
weather than the Aes Sedai. Also, although women will still be taught 
the weaves, affecting the weather is impossible right now. The 
influence of the Dark One has the world stuck in a perpetual summer 
drought. There is little need to go into more detail on the weaves 
involved in this particular ability when one considers that the ability 
simply cannot be used at this current time and, even if it could be, 
since the process is so time-consuming, it would most likely be RP that 
is done out of the scene.

  <ghelp keyword="shielding">
    <entry>
&amp;gSHIELDING&amp;n
.
This is a rather simple weave of Spirit shaped into a wedge and pushed 
between the target and her connection to the One Power. If the target 
is caught unawares, this is not a very difficult task to accomplish. If 
she resists, it is quite a difficult task, requiring a strength 
advantage in the One Power. If the target is embracing the source, it 
is that much harder still. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves thick flows of Spirit into a wedge-shaped construct and 
shoves it at Lou Ann&apos;s connection to the Source, attempting to seperate 
her from it.&amp;n 
.
Just as it requires a large advantage in strength to shield someone who 
is embracing, one must also be much stronger than one&apos;s opponent to 
break a shield that is being maintained. 
.
When dealing with male channelers, one woman is rarely able to shield a 
man. An average Aes Sedai could not shield an average Asha&apos;man unaided. 
Tradition in the Tower calls for a circle of thirteen to shield a man 
and a circle of six to maintain that shield. In practice, these numbers 
are rarely needed. However, there is no way for an Aes Sedai to judge a 
man&apos;s strength without trying to shield him. Since the taint makes male 
channelers so dangerous, Tradition leaves no room for error. Thirteen 
linked Aes Sedai are capable of shielding any man. Once the shield is 
in place, a circle of six is capable of holding that shield on any man. 
In most cases, non-bookie player characters will be dealing with other 
non-bookie player characters. It is the consensus among the channeling 
GLs of this MUD that because of the average strength difference and 
because of the inefficient strength gain from linking, a circle of four 
Sedai should be able to shield an Asha&apos;man. It might be possible with 
three, but this would be a close thing. It must be emphasized that this 
is assuming average, non-bookie player characters. Because of the 
inefficiency of linking, the strength of the women involved has much 
less impact on the number needed than the strength of the man. 
.
Conversely, from numerous examples in the books, one man is typically 
sufficient to shield an Aes Sedai. This hardly seems fair on the 
surface of it. However, thirteen of the weakest Aes Sedai can shield 
the Dragon Reborn out of hand. In those very rare instances where a man 
is not strong enough to shield a female opponent, he cannot link with 
another man to overcome her.

    <entry>
&amp;W(continued from ghelp 50 wards)&amp;n

&amp;WTrap Wards:&amp;n
A trap ward is a framework of Spirit holding some other weave that is 
set to release when a certain condition occurs. Two examples from the 
books are the ward Siune Sanche had on her letter box when she was 
Amyrlin and the prank that Siuane and Moiraine played on one of their 
teachers when they were students in the Tower where they rigged a ball 
of water to drop on the Sister&apos;s head when she entered her apartment. 
This is likely the most complex type of warding. Exactly how it is set 
up depends on a variety of things. What triggers it? What happens when 
it is triggered? The way the weave is formed depends upon these 
answers. In a case of a box or door opening being the trigger, it is 
likely that the weave is done in three parts. In the exampe of the box, 
inside the box would be the framework of Spirit that holds the Fire 
weave. The second part is the Fire weave itself. The third part would 
be a weave of Spirit attached to the lid such than when the lid opens, 
the two weaves of Spirit cease touching each other, which releases the 
Fire weave to do it&apos;s set function. The same principle would apply to 
the trap on the doorway. A ward could also be set up to release a weave 
when a person passed through the warding. This would require a 
detection ward to sense the presense of the person and then the 
framework of Spirit to hold the &quot;trapped&quot; weave. For the most part 
these wards are ineffective against channelers of the same gender 
unless they are low power weaves and are attached to the other side of 
an opaque surface such as the lid of a box or the back of a door. 
Otherwise, they would be seen and easily avoided. 
.
&amp;cJane carefully refolds the letter and drops it into the ornate ivory 
case. Embracing, she quickly weaves a small web of Spirit into the 
bottom of the box. Holding that weave, she channels threads of Fire, as 
well, into a construct designed to incinerate the the papers in the 
case, but with the web of Spirit carefully interposed to prevent the 
fire weave from completing. She ties both weaves off deftly, leaving a 
loose end on the Spirit weave in a slip knot pattern, such that if she 
tugged on it, the entire thing would unravel. She fixes a simple thread 
of Spirit to the inside of the lid and gently lowers it, attaching that 
thread to the loose end just before the lid closes.&amp;n

  <ghelp keyword="wards">

&amp;gWARDS&amp;n
.
Wards are weaves used to keep things out or warn of their presense. 
They can also be used as traps. The three main types of ward covered 
here are detection, barrier and trap. 
.
&amp;WDetection Wards:&amp;n
The construction of a detection ward is dependent on what types of 
things are being detected. If one is setting up a ward to warn when 
living things contact it, then the weave will be made of pure Spirit. 
If one wanted to make an elaborate ward that would alert her to the 
presense of armored soldiers, Spirit would still be required for the 
framework of the weave and to detect the person, but Earth would also 
be required to pick up the presense of the metal. It is possible to 
refine the lifeform detection and narrow it down. Wards can be made to 
warn of Shadowspawn or humans. Use of Saidar should be detectable, as 
well. It is theoretically possible to narrow it down to being able to 
set up a ward to warn if a woman capable of channeling approaches. In 
fact, all of this is just theory and guesswork since Robert Jordan does 
not go into much detail or description when his characters weave wards. 
.
&amp;cJane concentrates and spins out thin threads of Spirit in a complex 
web, straining to extend it to cover the entire campsite, perhaps an 
area thiry feet in radius. As she ties off the weave and releases 
Saidar, she says with fatigue evident in her voice,&apos;We will be warned 
now if anyone attempts to surprise us in our sleep.&apos;&amp;n
.
&amp;WBarrier Wards:&amp;n
This is almost the opposite of a detection ward. Instead of being 
receptive to the presense of a certain creature or material, the 
polarity of the weave is reversed, causing it to repulse such things. 
For the most part, this is only useful for dealing with vermin. Aes 
Sedai commonly use it to keep rats and such out of any dwelling they 
may occupy. It would require a great deal of power to repulse anything 
larger. Basically this particular weave just generates an unpleasant 
sensation that causes the rats to avoid the warded area. An intelligent 
creature, such as a Fade, would be able to persevere through the 
discomfort unless the weave was of sufficient magnitude to kill, in 
which case the Fade would sense it from a goodly distance, rending the 
ward more of a large glowing arrow pointing out the weaver than an 
actual useful defensive weave. As with the detection ward, a barrier 
ward that keeps out living things would be compused of Spirit. 
Theoretically, it should be possible to create a ward that would 
repulse non-living objects as well, such as arrows. In practice,this 
would be next to impossible or at least so difficult as to make a 
simple shield of Air a much more feasible option. One practical example 
of a ward that repulses non-living things is the barrier against 
eavesdropping. Examples: 
.
&amp;cJane&apos;s eyes narrow in concentration as she weaves threads of Spirit 
into a grid pattern which grows to cover the ground level of the entire 
Inn. Her nose wrinkles slightly in further concentration as she 
carefully tunes the vibrations of the weave. After several long 
moments, she smiles in satisfaction and ties the weave off. Turning to 
the tavern keeper, she says softly,&quot;Thank you for your assistace, 
Master Brill. Your establishment shall be troubled by vermin no more.&quot;&amp;n 
.
&amp;cJane sighs in exasperation and then embraces the Source. As soon as the 
soft glow of Saidar surrounds her, she begins weaving a conical shell 
of Air and Spirit around herself and Sue. The air shimmers around them 
briefly before Jane says,&quot;What I have to tell you, Sister, is not for 
public consumption.&quot;&amp;n

&amp;gSHADOWSPAWN&amp;n
.
Trollocs: About 8-10 feet tall, these creatures combine elements of man 
and animal. They have the heads of various types of animals and birds, 
and some have hoofed feet as well. They use crude weapons and can be 
killed by a trained swordsman or by the One Power. They are generally 
both stupid and cowardly, and they usually need a smarter and stronger 
leader to keep them in line and force them into action. This leader is 
frequently a Myrddraal. 
.
Myrddraal: Also known as Halfmen, the Eyeless, Fades, Lurks, Shadowmen, 
or Fetches, all Fades look the same. They are taller than the average 
man, with pasty white skin and no eyes. They dress all in black. Their 
clothing does not move in the wind. They can feel use of the One Power. 
Their main weapon is a black sword that has been forged in Thakandar. 
Wounds from these blades do not heal properly. Without the help of a 
talented Healer the wounded certainly die. Myrddraal are difficult to 
kill with steel and may require the use of the One Power, but they will 
not cross running water by choice. Fades have no reflection other than 
a misty form. Their gaze causes physical fear in a person. They often 
link with their patrol of Trollocs and use that link to direct and 
force them into action. The best way to defeat a patrol of Trollocs is 
to find the Myrrdraal in command and kill it. This will kill or disable 
all the trollocs linked to that fade. A Fade will not die instantly and 
can thrash for hours after it&apos;s death. They do not die completely until 
the setting of the sun. There is some uncertainty over a skill by which 
they can fade into and out of shadows. 
.
Draghkar: These large winged, flying creatures are frequently used as 
assassins and scouts for the Dark. They are not very intelligent and do 
not fight well. Their main attack is to use a song that entices their 
victims to come closer as if in a daze. Once the victim is in range, 
the Draghkar gives them a kiss. This kiss drains the soul and then 
life. Those who have been rescued once the kiss has begun would have 
been better off dead. 
.
Darkhounds: These hounds are as large as ponies and frequently used to 
track specific victims. They have the usual abilities of dogs, and can 
be confused by some of the same tricks such as crossing water. They 
travel in packs of 8-10, and are the source of legends of the Wild 
Hunt. Their paws do not leave prints in dirt or mud although they can 
melt pawprints into stone. There is a scent of sulfur about them which 
can alert one to their presence and their saliva is an immensly 
corrosive and powerful poison. In recent times a new breed of Darkhound 
has been reported abroad in thw world, one that apparently can be slain 
only with the One Power. Stories tell of the beasts being cut to pieces 
with power-wrought weapons only to have their hacked parts melt and 
reform into whole, living hounds. 
.
Grey Men: Once human, these assassins gave up their souls to the Dark 
One in exchange for the ability to pass unnoticed by even the most 
alert guards. Their appearance is so ordinary that the mind simply 
doesn&apos;t register their presence, but once discovered they can be killed 
in the same way as any other shadowspawn. 
.
Rats and Ravens: Often spies for the dark one. One of the good things 
about having an Aes Sedai stay at an Inn is that she will often rid the
place of vermin.

&amp;gREBEL TOWER POLITICAL RELATIONS&amp;n
.
This list explains the relations the Rebel Tower has with other groups 
that exist on the mud. Obviously this won&apos;t be true for all Aes Sedai, 
but is the guild&apos;s general stance on these groups. 
.
&amp;WThe White Tower:&amp;n Uneasy. The White Tower is currently under the 
leadership of the usurper, Elaida. Be wary of them. Any who wish to 
join our side are welcome, but eventual conflict with the others is 
inevitable, as our goal is to remove the false Amyrlin and put the true 
Amyrlin, Egwene al&apos;Vere in her place. 
.
&amp;RA&amp;rs&amp;Rh&amp;ra&amp;R&apos;&amp;rm&amp;Ra&amp;rn&amp;R:&amp;n Wary. These men are trained to channel tainted Saidin. They 
serve the Dragon Reborn and must be tolerated for now as they will 
likely be needed for the Last Battle. Eventually they must be dealt 
with to prevent another Breaking. Currently, they patrol in Caemlyn 
often. &amp;YImportant Caemlyn Note:&amp;n The Dragon Reborn, Rand al&apos;Thor is in 
control of the city in the Queen&apos;s absence. He has an edict in place 
stating that any woman who wishes to be allowed to channel should 
identify herself to the Queen&apos;s Guard and wear visible identification 
(shawl/ring), or run the risk of being arrested by the Asha&apos;man. 
.
&amp;WChildren of the Light:&amp;n Foe. A whitecloak will stop at nothing to see an 
Aes Sedai, whom they call &apos;witches&apos;, dead. They feel the same about 
warders. Avoid at all costs, although most whitecloaks won&apos;t be foolish 
enough to try arresting an Aes Sedai in public. 
.
&amp;mN&amp;Yo&amp;mb&amp;Yi&amp;ml&amp;Yi&amp;mt&amp;Yy&amp;m:&amp;n Most nobles respect Aes Sedai, but many cannot be trusted as 
they are deeply involved in the game of houses. 
.
&amp;yH&amp;Yu&amp;yn&amp;Yt&amp;ye&amp;Yr&amp;ys&amp;Y o&amp;yf &amp;Yt&amp;yh&amp;Ye &amp;yH&amp;Yo&amp;yr&amp;Yn&amp;y:&amp;n Will often be nosy for information about the Horn. 
They are NOT to know where the horn is, or who sounded it. Tell them 
nothing at all, other than the simple history that most hunters are 
already well versed in. 
.
&amp;RDragonsworn:&amp;n Hostile. A group of fanatics that follows the &apos;prophet&apos; 
and preaches the ways of the Dragon Reborn, and the evils of Aes Sedai. 
This prophet, Masema, is delusional and should not be trusted. 
.
&amp;rBand of the Red Hand:&amp;n A large group of mercenaries led by Matrim 
Cauthon, a childhood friend of the Dragon Reborn and the Amyrlin. He is 
known to be strongly ta&apos;veren. Most of the Band is camped near Salidar,
now. Their intentions are not fully clear. They bear watching. 
.
&amp;yA&amp;Ki&amp;ye&amp;Kl&amp;y:&amp;n People from across the Spine of the World. They have high respect 
for Aes Sedai in their history. The Shaido, however, are outright 
hostile. 
.
&amp;mSeanchan:&amp;n Foe/Rumor. Little firm information is known, but rumor says 
that they use the One Power in battle. Treat tentatively. 
.
&amp;gOgier:&amp;n Most are friendly and also respect Aes Sedai, but beware of 
those who actually wield weapons. 
.
&amp;MTinkers:&amp;n Harmless. They are followers of the pacifistic Way of the 
Leaf. They are also known as the Travelling People. They move around 
the countryside in their garishly painted wagons seeking the song.

&amp;gMASHADAR&amp;n
.
To explain the evil that is mashadar its easiest to consider what 
created it. 
.
Roughly two hundred years after the Breaking of the World the Compact 
of the Ten Nations was formed. Society flourished in the hopes of 
regaining the wonders of the Age of Legends, and one of the nations in 
this compact was Aridhol. For hundreds of years the Compact held, and 
these nations flourished, until the Trollocs came howling out of the 
Blight at around 1000 AB. 
.
A man named Mordeth came to Aridhol at this time, gaining the ear of 
King Balwen Mayel. The king thought perhaps Mordeth had the solution, 
use the tactics of the Shadow against the Shadow. The people of Aridhol 
hardened and became isolated. It became a place to be avoided by even 
their former allies. The people of Aridhol abandoned the Light, their 
hatred and suspicion spawning the evil that is Mashadar. 
.
As Balwen withered, Mordeth became the true power in Aridhol. Prince 
Caar, the son of King Thorin of Manetheren, came to try and win Aridhol 
back to the Compact. Mordeth had Caar imprisoned as a Darkfriend, but 
he escaped and fled. When an army from Manetheren came to avenge Caar, 
they found nothing living within the city. The evil the folk of Aridhol 
had created had destroyed them. From then on the city would be called 
Shadar Logath. 
.
Mashadar is some sort of physical manifestation of the evil nature of 
the city. No enemy had come to Aridhol but Aridhol itself. Suspicion 
and hate had given birth to something that fed on that which created 
it, something locked in the bedrock on which the city stood. 
.
Physically, Mashadar is a slightly glowing fog. It moves through the 
city as aimlessly as a worm burrows through the earth, its touch 
bringing death. It is not sentient. As a hint of how strong the evil of 
Mashadar is, Moraine believed that the whole of the White Tower working 
together could not kill or neutralize the evil of Mashadar in Shadar 
Logath. Even Trollocs will not enter the city without Myrddraal to 
force them, and something fierce to drive the Myrddraal.

&amp;gMACHIN SHIN&amp;n
.
&amp;KThe Black Wind&amp;n
.
After the breaking of the world, a group of male Aes Sedai took refuge 
from the taint inside the Ogier stedding. After a while, the call of 
Saidin became too much for them and they left the stedding. In exchange 
for giving them sanctuary, these male Aes Sedai gave the Ogier a 
valuable gift, the Ways. Grown from the One Power in a way no longer 
understood, the Ways connected all the known stedding. These Ways were 
separate from the pattern. Even when the Ways connected two areas which 
were separated by the shattering of the land, the Ways remained 
unchanged. These Aes Sedai also gave the Ogier the Talisman of Growing, 
a terangreal which could be used to grow the Ways to other stedding as 
they were discovered after the Breaking. 
.
For nearly two thousand years the Ogier used the Ways to move between 
stedding. The Ways were well lighted, and covered with a thick grass, 
and the islands within the Ways were also filled with large fruit trees 

which could be enjoyed by travelers. The Ways were a beautiful place in 
tune with nature, much like the Ogier stedding they connected. 
.
All that changed around the time of the War of the Hundred Years. The 
Ways darkened, and the living things disappeared. The stone itself 
became pitted and decayed. Travelers sometimes entered the Ways and 
never came out, or came out drastically changed. 
.
One of the most terrifying discoveries during this deterioration was 
that of Machin Shin, the Black Wind. Those who are touched by the Black 
Wind lose their minds and their souls. None know for certain where 
Machin Shin came from but there are two likely possibilities: that it 
is a product of the taint on Saidin which was used to create the Ways, 
or that it is a parasite living off the Ways. 
.
Fire can be used against Machin Shin, but the black wind cannot be 
defeated or completely destroyed.

Be&apos;lal: Be&apos;lal was originally known as Duram Laddel Cham, and was a 
better manipulator than Rahvin and more skillful than Sammael in 
dealing with enemies in open conflict. He too served with the armies of 
the light, and later turned to the Dark One. He is rumored to have been 
killed by Moiraine Damodred.
.
Asmodean: Before turning to the Shadow, Joar Addam Nessosin was an 
accomplished musician. He later became Asomdean. Asmodean was never a 
general for any army, though he did serve as a governor of conquered 
territories. Perhaps one of his greatest atrocities was the revenge he 
took against the world&apos;s most famous musicians and artists. Asmodean 
had these artists maimed so they would never again be able to perform 
their art, then released them. 
.
Aginor: The man called Aginor was the second most powerful of the male 
Forsaken. He was originally named Ishar Morrad Chuain, and was one of 
the foremost biological scientists of the Age of Legends. He created 
most of the shadowspawn. 
.
Balthamel: Before turning to the Shadow, Eval Ramman was a historian 
unable to distinguish himself enough to earn the coveted third name. He 
specialized in the study of vanished cultures, but his work was not 
outstanding. Eval had a bad temper, which almost caused him to be bound 
with the One Power. As Balthamel he was well liked by women and set up 
camps breeding humans as trolloc food. He turned because he wanted to 
be immortal.

  <ghelp keyword="forsaken">
    <entry>
&amp;gFORSAKEN&amp;n
.
The Forsaken were the thirteen most prominent Aes Sedai to defect to
the Shadow during the War of Power in the Age of Legends. They were
trapped in Shayol Ghul and sealed in with the Dark One by Lews Therin
and his Hundred Companions. Since the seals on the Dark One&apos;s prison
began to weaken, they have been loosed upon the world once more. 
.
Lanfear: The first of the Forsaken to swear to the shadow was Mierin 
Sedai, a woman who was Lews Therin&apos;s childhood lover. She burned with 
ambition and lust for power. Disgusted with her aspirations Lews Therin 
turned away from her and fell into the arms of his eventual wife, 
Ilyena Moerell. Unsuccessful in her attempts to recapture Lews Therin&apos;s 
heart, Mierin turned away from the light, forswore her oaths as a 
protector of all that was good and swore her allegiance to Shai&apos;tan, 
her new and dark master. After swearing her new oaths she would always 
be known as Lanfear, Daughter of the Night. 
.
Semirhage: Semirhage was one of the most powerful healers of the age, 
her skill and notoriety known throughout the world. After bringing her 
patients back from the brink of death she would extract a price from 
them, torture, for her own pleasure. The Hall of Servants gave her an 
ultimatum of either being stilled and outcast, or being bound in some 
way with the power, leading a life of contemplation and being able to 
see the end of life approach. She was one of the first women to flee to 
the Dark Lord, and forswear her oaths to the Light. 
.
Mesaana: Saine Tarasind was a teacher, but wanted to do research. 
Unfulfilled, Saine turned to the Shadow. Mesaana proved herself an 
adequate general, but was brilliant as a governor of conquered 
territory. Her administrations were efficient, and she started schools 
which taught children to spy and report on each other. 
.
Graendal: Graendal was certainly the most decadent and flashy of the 
Forsaken. However, prior to turning to the Shadow, Kamarike Mardim 
Nindar lived a simple life. She helped heal mentally ill patients who 
could not be helped by Healing or the One Power. Serving the darkness, 
her skills with the mind were turned towards Compulsion. Very few could 
hold to their will when facing her. 
.
Moghedien: The forsaken Moghedien turned to the Shadow long before the 
War of Power actually began. However, she joined Lews Therin&apos;s staff 
and gained a position of high standing. Several disasters early in the 
war were the result of her work. Originally, she was called Lillen 
Morial. Her greatest talent was her expertise in Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod. 
.
Demandred: The life of Demandred can be summed up with a brief 
statement. He was always second. He never gained any significant fame 
for the Light, or was exalted for miracles he performed. The reason for 
this was Lews Therin. Next to the Dragon, Demandred was just another 
Aes Sedai, but if the Dragon had not been born Demandred would have 
been the most powerful man of the age. Always envying Lews Therin&apos;s 
fame and glory, he turned bitter, and fled to Shai&apos;tan to swell the 
ranks of the Shadow. 
.
Ishamael:Before turning to the Shadow, Ishamael&apos;s name was Elan Morin 
Tedronai. Ishamael means &apos;Betrayer of Hope&apos; in the Old Tongue. He was 
also known as Baalzamon, Heart of the Dark, and Soul of the Shadow. He 
was a philosopher, and one of the strongest male Aes Sedai. 
.
Rahvin: Little of Rahvin&apos;s life before turning to the Shadow is known. 
He was named Ared Mosinel. Rahvin&apos;s major weakness was his fondness for 
women. He was also susceptible to flattery. He prefered politics to 
war, and was a user of Compulsion. 
.
Sammael: Known as Tel Janin Aellinsar, Sammael was a world renowned 
sportsman and general in Lews Therin&apos;s army. In the midst of a battle 
against the shadow he turned to the dark one and became Sammael. He 
wears a scar that was never healed, and will wear it until he defeats 
the Dragon.

    <entry>
&amp;gThe AJAHS&amp;n
.
&amp;rThe Red Ajah:&amp;n This ajah is responsible for tracking down men who can 
channel and bringing them to the tower for gentling. Sisters of the Red 
Ajah do not take Gaidin, and often have very little trust for men in 
general. Most of them believe that a man who can channel and doesn&apos;t 
turn himself over for gentling is a darkfriend. There are no Red 
sisters in Salidar. 
.
&amp;BThe Blue Ajah:&amp;n A Sister of this ajah will dedicate her life to a 
specific cause. There are no sisters of the Blue Ajah in the White 
Tower. Their banners have been torn down and their color removed from 
the dresses of Accepted and the stole of the Amyrlin. 
.
&amp;WThe White Ajah:&amp;n Sisters of this ajah devote themselves to the study of 
logic and reason. Although it is not universal, the stereotypical White 
will be cold and distant. Many think that emotion interferes with 
logical, rational decisions. 
.
&amp;KThe Grey Ajah:&amp;n The province of this ajah is mediation. The Sisters of 
the Grey are sent to negotiate treaties, end wars and prevent 
conflicts. They are typically well versed in diplomacy and the laws of 
many nations. 
.
&amp;YThe Yellow Ajah:&amp;n The Sisters of this ajah are all interested in Healing 
and the study of disease and ailments. Although talented Healers can be 
found in other ajahs, the absolute best are in the Yellow. All of its 
members are above average with the Talent. However, it is the interest,
not the Talent, that defines the ajah. 
.
&amp;yThe Brown Ajah:&amp;n The Brown ajah dedicates itself to study and research. 
They are interested not only in history, but also artifacts. Most of 
the women who study ter&apos;angreal are from the Brown. The stereotypical 
Brown seems lost in thought much of the time and is less concerned with 
her appearance than would by typical of a member of another ajah. Wool 
dresses are much more common than silk. 
.
&amp;gThe Green Ajah:&amp;n The Green is also called the Battle Ajah. All Ajahs 
will stand against the Shadow at the Last Battle, but the Green devotes 
itself to preparing for it. They prepare not only for the last battle, 
but they fought against the Dreadlords in the Trolloc Wars. This is the 
only ajah whose members take more than one warder each. Women of other 
ajahs typically consider Greens to be flirtatious. 
.
If the student wishes additional information on any particular Ajah, 
she should seek out an experienced member of that Ajah to question 
either ICly or OOCly.

&amp;W(continued from acc_weaves)&amp;n

&amp;yMend:&amp;n A piece of broken crockery or metal can be melded back together 
using flows of Earth. (NOTE: Using this weave to repair a weapon, while 
not technically a direct violation of the second of the three oaths, is
against Tower Tradition.) 
.
&amp;cJane holds the two broken halves of the flower pot together and 
channels thin threads of Earth into them, causing the edges to soften 
and flow together. When she releases the weave, she studies the pot for 
a moment, then mutters,&apos;Not perfect, but it will hold.&apos;&amp;n
.
&amp;BFind Water:&amp;n Thin, probing flows can be used for finding underground 
sources of water. Of course, this is not a guaranteed thing. If the 
water is very deep or not very plentiful, it will be difficult to find.
There also may not be any water close enough to detect. If a source is 
found, and if one is strong in Earth as well and the source found is 
not terribly deep, one might be able to create a small well to bring 
the water to the surface. 
.
&amp;cJane wanders through the field, heeled by her fancloth clad warder, 
with a frown of deep concentration on her face. Probing flows of Water 
descend from her into the ground, seeking deep inside the earth. After 
perhaps an hour of searching, she turns to her Gaidin and says,&quot;This is 
the spot. Fetch the farmer and let him know this is where he should dig 
his well.&quot;&amp;n 
.
&amp;CF&amp;Bo&amp;Cg&amp;B:&amp;n Flows of Air and Water can be used to create a thick fog, useful 
for confusing pursuit or aerial observation. 
.
&amp;cJane adjusts her shawl more snugly about her as she peers about her 
into the cold, moonlit night. Embracing Saidar, she channels threads of 
Water and Air laced together and fans them out from herself like fine 
tendrils. Slowly the air begins to feel damp, then strands of fog can 
be seen drifting in the moonlight. After several minutes of 
concentrated work, Jane releases Saidar with a tired sigh and nods to 
her warder barely seen a couple of paces away in the thick fog.&amp;n 
.
&amp;WEnhance Plant Growth:&amp;n This is the Spirit weave that is used to keep the 
gardens of Tar Valon blooming even in this hideous drought. It can be 
used to make plants flourish in any weather. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves fine threads of Spirit into the rose. Rapidly, the wilting 
fades away, replaced by a healthy sheen.&amp;n

&amp;gACCEPTED WEAVES&amp;n
.
The purpose of this document is to list some more intermediate weaves 
or uses for the One Power that would be likely taught to Accepted so 
that the guild can have standard examples of how these should be done. 
The list is not all inclusive. That would likely not be possible. It is
a rough guideline of the things an Accepted should learn. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
.
&amp;WRefresh:&amp;n This is a spirit weave used to wash away fatigue. The subject 
must be touched, as with all Healing weaves. It is dangerous if 
overused, as it only removes the feeling of fatigue, instead of 
actually replenishing one&apos;s reserves. 
.
&amp;cJane raises up on her toes and extends her right hand to touch Joe on 
the forehead. She spins a complex web of Spirit which she then passes 
through his body, causing all signs of his exhaustion to vanish.&amp;n
.
&amp;YHealing:&amp;n This is a complex web of Water, Spirit and Air. It is woven 
into a gauze-like weave that is passed through the patient&apos;s body. Once 
this weave is learned, one&apos;s ability with it is determined purely by 
her talent for Healing. The talent is a sliding scale, ranging from 
those who can only heal bruises to those who are able to fan the 
slightest spark of life back to full health. Although the talent seems 
to have a wide range, the effects of the weave are more of a toggle 
switch than a scale. If the patient&apos;s wounds are within the ability of 
the channeler to Heal, then the patient is fully healed by the weave. 
If the wound is beyond the channeler&apos;s ability, the patient is not 
healed at all. The wound in Rand&apos;s side is an exception to this rule. 
This is such an exception that it has visibly shocked every Aes Sedai 
to encounter it, even through their fabled serenity. Unless the slight 
delay would risk the patient&apos;s life, it is a good idea to Delve him or 
her first. There are more details in the description of the Delve weave 
below. 
.
&amp;cJane grasps Joe&apos;s head firmly in her hands. She channels flows of Air, 
Water and Spirit, weaving them into a complex, gauze-like structure 
which she moves throughout his body. As the weave passes through him, 
the flesh behind it writhes as the wounds knit closed.&amp;n 
.
&amp;WDelve:&amp;n Thin probing flows of Spirit are used to search through a 
patient and diagnose any injuries. It is generally better to delve the 
subject before Healing to determine the extent of the injuries so that 
the weave may be better directed or even to determine if the injuries 
are within the abilities of the channeler to Heal. After emoting the 
delve weave, it is a good idea to discuss the injury with the patient 
OOCly through tells, or some other channel, and negotiate the success 
or failure of the subsequent Healing weave. 
.
&amp;cJane probes throughout the patient&apos;s body with fine threads of Spirit, 
grimly assessing the extent of his injuries.&amp;n 
.
&amp;yOpen Lock:&amp;n Threads of Earth are used to manipulate the mechanisms in a 
lock and cause it to open. 
.
&amp;cJane grasps the padlock in her right hand, brow furrowing in 
concentration as she weaves thin threads of Earth into it. After a 
moment, she smiles in satisfaction and gives the lock a tug. Her smile 
widens slightly as it pops open.&amp;n 
.
&amp;yRend Earth:&amp;n Massive flows of Earth can be used to cause the ground to 
heave and open beneath a target&apos;s feet, much as in an earthquake. This 
is very fatiguing for most women as they do not have much strength in 
Earth. (NOTE: As with any hostile weaving, care must be taken to avoid 
conflicts with the Oaths.) 
.
&amp;cJane sinks thick flows of Earth into the ground in front of her, 
sending them towards the line of charging trollocs. The ground suddenly 
gapes open into a jagged ditch in front of the shadowspawn. As the 
first victims trip, screaming in rage, into the crevasse, she releases 
Saidar and staggers as if exhausted.&amp;n

&amp;gACCEPTED SYLLABUS&amp;n
.
&amp;WLectures:&amp;n
.
The student should read the following lectures or have them taught to 
her. It is not really important if the teaching is done as roleplay or 
explained OOCly. The important part is that the student absorb the 
material. 
.
&amp;b   *&amp;nAccepted rules (ghelp 50 acc_rules)
&amp;b   *&amp;nThe Ajahs (ghelp 50 ajahs)
&amp;b   *&amp;nRebel Tower Relations (ghelp 50 relations)
&amp;b   *&amp;nShadowspawn (ghelp 50 shadowspawn)
&amp;b   *&amp;nThe Forsaken (ghelp 50 forsaken)
.
&amp;WChanneling:&amp;n
.
The student should read and become familiar with the material in the 
Readings section. If there is any part with which she has trouble, she 
should request to have the lessons taught to her. A student should also 
feel free to ask a higher ranking member for clarification on anything 
she does not understand. 
.
&amp;b   *&amp;nAccepted Weaves (ghelp 50 acc_weaves)
&amp;b   *&amp;nWards (ghelp 50 wards)
&amp;b   *&amp;nShielding (ghelp 50 shielding)
&amp;b   *&amp;nWeather Control (ghelp 50 weather_control)
&amp;b   *&amp;nKnotting and Unknotting Weaves (ghelp 50 knotting)
&amp;b   *&amp;nLinking (ghelp 50 linking)
&amp;b   *&amp;nAngreal, Ter&apos;angreal, Sa&apos;angreal (ghelp 50 angreal)
.
&amp;WLessons:&amp;n
.
The student should have the following lessons taught to her:
.
&amp;b   *&amp;nNature of the Bond 
&amp;b   *&amp;nCombat Channeling 
.
&amp;WTests:&amp;n
.
&amp;YOOC Test:&amp;n First the student will be tested in an out of character 
interview. She will be required to show competence with emoting the 
weaves covered in the earlier section, as well as being required to 
answer technical questions about them. She will also be responsible for 
either knowing the material in the lectures or at least being able to 
reference it quickly enough to answer questions or form emotes based on 
questions about them. Anything covered in the syllabus is fair game for
questions. If the student does not pass, she will have to wait one real 
life week before she may request to be tested again. During this time, 
she is free to request that any of the earlier lessons be retaught to 
her. This will be a very stringent test. The reason is that Aes Sedai 
should meet high standards. There are also many lessons that are not 
learned until after one attains the shawl. Since there are no tests 
after being raised to the shawl, it must be made certain that those who 
pass to that point do not need further testing.
.
&amp;WNOTE:&amp;n This test should never be conducted by only one person. The 
recommended numbers for the test would be a Sitter and two other Aes 
Sedai or a GL and one other Aes Sedai. If at all possible, one of the 
Sedai involved should be the Head or a Sitter for the Ajah the student 
is seeking. If scheduling makes this difficult, then a GL should 
conduct the test and log it to mail to the other GL for an additional 
opinion. 
.
&amp;yIC Test:&amp;n Next, if the student passes the OOC test, she will be required 
to roleplay her taking of the Three Oaths. Since the Rebels do not have 
an Oath Rod, it will not be part of the ceremony. The Oaths will still 
be sworn, however. The Oaths are what makes one an Aes Sedai. Whether 
they are sworn on the Oath Rod or not, they should be followed at all 
times. After being raised, she may opt to roleplay out the seeking of 
her Ajah. This is not required, and in many cases may not be possible 
due to inactivity of the particular Ajah. 
.
If the student fails either test, she will have to wait one real week 
before she may request to be tested again. As with the Novice Syllabus,
she may use this week to retake any of the lessons she wishes. If she 
passes, she will be raised to Aes Sedai with all the appropriate 
changes in guild equipment and guild skills associated.

&amp;gACCEPTED RULES&amp;n
.
Accepted must curtsey to, respect and obey all Aes Sedai. 
.
Just as when Novices, Accepted should use common sense and discretion 
when dealing with males of any rank. Chatting about the weather in a 
public place is perfectly acceptable. Canoodling in a private corner of 
the garden is not. 
.
Accepted can supervise Novices in chores such as kitchen work or 
outside labor, and assign chores and duties to Novices when there isn&apos;t 
an Aes Sedai or the MoN to do it. 
.
Accepted should aid the Aes Sedai in any kind of work they do, and help 
instruct Novices - both lessons on channelling and lectures. 
.
Since Salidar is just a village surrounded pretty much by wilderness, 
there is no city outside for them to wander into. Thus, the rules for 
leaving are the same as for Novices. They are to remain in Salidar at 
all times.

&amp;gDETECTING FEMALE CHANNELERS&amp;n
.
As the student&apos;s ability with the One Power grows, she will gradually 
reach a point where she is able to sense the same ability within other 
women. This ability would not likely show up until the student is fully 
competent with embracing and releasing the One Power. In game terms, a 
student is set with the code skill for this, test, when she is raised 
to Accepted. 
.
It is easier to sense the ability in one who is trained. It is also 
possible to gain a rough idea of the person&apos;s strength in the One Power 
relative to one&apos;s own. For those who are untrained, it is possible to 
get an idea of their potential strength. One can also tell if the young 
girl is teachable or if she has the spark inborn. The books never 
discuss exactly how this is done. They can just tell. 
.
This is not a very long range ability. If a woman is not holding the 
Power, another woman would not be able to sense the ability in her at 
more than five or six feet(approx. two meters) away. If one is not 
paying close attention, it is difficult to tell at more than arm&apos;s 
length. 
.
Use of the One Power can be sensed much further away, depending on how 
much is used. Since women trained in the use of Saidar can see a glow 
around other women who are holding the Power, then she would be able to 
notice another woman in her line of sight channeling as far away as she 
could see her. If line of sight is not possible, the exact range of 
detection is harder to determine. As a rough guide, if someone is 
channeling in a building the size of an inn, and the amount channeled 
is not purposely miniscule, another woman trained in channeling should 
be able to detect it.

&amp;gTHE THREE OATHS&amp;n
.
All Aes Sedai swear the three Oaths on the Oath Rod when they are 
raised to the shawl. As the Oaths are spoken there is said to be a 
feeling of the oaths &quot;settling&quot; into the Sedai and a tightening of the 
skin, along with a mild burning sensation. Rebel Aes Sedai raised since
the split in the Tower do not hold the Rod when they swear, although 
&amp;Wthey do still take the Oaths&amp;n. They should still strive to live by 
them, as should Novices and Accepted. 
.
&amp;WThe Oaths:&amp;n
.
&amp;g1.&amp;n Speak no word that is not true. 
&amp;g2.&amp;n Make no weapon for one man to kill another.
&amp;g3.&amp;n Never use the One Power as a weapon except against Darkfriends 
or Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defending her own life, that 
of her Warder, or that of another Sister. 
.
The most important thing about the Oaths is why they are sworn. Each 
has a specific reason. By swearing to tell only the truth, Aes Sedai 
prove that they can be trusted, that if they make a promise, they will 
keep it. Aes Sedai have the ability to craft or enhance objects with 
the One Power. By swearing the second oath they reassure the rest of 
the nations that they will never be involved in the raising of armies 
or the propagation of war. An army of soldiers whose swords cannot be 
broken and shields would never dent would be at a massive advantage. 
The third oath assures the nations that the Aes Sedai are not an 
agressive power. With the Power that broke the world at their beck and 
call, they would be unstoppable should they decide to expand their 
control. 
.
All women being trained to become Aes Sedai are expected to live as if 
they have already sworn these oaths, regardless of whether or not they 
are in the White Tower. In the White Tower a woman swears before the 
Amyrlin on the day she is raised the the shawl. In Salidar it is much 
the same, although the Oath Rod isn&apos;t present. 
.
On a practical note, one who sworn the Oaths on the Oath Rod is 
completely incapable of breaking them. The Oath Rod binds her to her 
word. However, there are ways to deceive without technically lying. For
example: 
.
&amp;cJane gives the servant a level stare, then introduces calmly, &quot;You 
may address me as Lady Sara. Please tell your lord I wish to speak with 
him as soon as it&apos;s convenient.&quot; &amp;n
.
Note that she did not say that her name is Sara, merely that the 
servant could call her Sara.

&amp;gGRASP AND RELEASE&amp;n
.
Grasping and releasing the One Power is something a member of the Aes 
Sedai will do very often. In fact, it will be done so often as to 
become a very trivial part of one&apos;s channeling emotes. 
.
In Robert Jordan&apos;s world, it could take weeks or even months for a girl
to become competent and embracing the One Power, depending on her 
natural aptitude for it and whether or not she had sparked. For most 
people, roleplaying these weeks or months of trying to embrace, but 
failing, is boring to say the least. If someone actually wants to 
roleplay such things, that is her decision. For most, however, this 
will be part of their character&apos;s assumed history. If the play can 
demonstrate a competence with emoting this, it will be assumed that her
character has spent the necessary time and practice. She may request to 
be tested on this whenever she feels ready. If she passes, she will 
have her grasp and release skills set to 70%. 
.
In the books, many different relaxation and visualization techniques 
are described for getting into the proper state of mind to embrace 
Saidar. These can be useful if one is actually RPing the lesson. 
However, they will likley never be used outside this lesson. Since it 
is generally accepted that one should not put thoughts into one&apos;s 
emotes, there is little purpose to these techniques other than to give 
one background information and perhaps aid in the feel of Jordan&apos;s rich 
world. For the sake of brevity, only the rosebud technique will be 
discussed here. 
.
The student should visualize herself as a tightly closed rosebud with 
Saidar as the sun. She should imagine turning towards the sun and 
slowly opening her petals to soak in the sunlight, allowing Saidar to 
flow into her. The important concept in this is the passivity of the 
student. Saidar should never be forced. One has to surrender herself to 
Saidar to control it. Women do not grasp the one power, they embrace 
it. They do not force it to their bidding, they gently guide it while 
allowing it to do their bidding. This is all useful background 
material, but difficult to use in an emote. An emote should only 
include those things which can be sensed by the audience. The Wheel of 
Time world does not have telepathy, so the audience cannot sense that 
the student is imagining herself as a rosebud. Her facial expressions 
and posture can be seen. Any noises she makes can be heard. Other 
female channelers can feel her channel and see a soft golden glow 
around her when she holds the power. The intensity of the glow will 
increase or decrease with the amount of Power she holds. These are 
things that can be included in the emote. An example: 
.
&amp;cJane takes a deep breath. As she slowly releases it, her face takes on 
a serene expression, muscles relaxing and smoothing. For those women 
present who can channel, a soft, golden nimbus surrounds her as she is 
slowly filled with Saidar. &amp;n
.
The previous example is not a bad emote for someone just learning to 
use the One Power. Embracing is still a task which requires time and 
concentration. As the student gains more practice, the Power will come 
more easily. Eventually the student will be able to embrace without 
thought, forming weaves almost instantly after embracing. The act of 
embracing will become a rather trivial part of the channeling emote. An 
example: 
.
&amp;cJane is surrounded by a golden aura, visible to other women who can 
channel, which grows brighter as she draws more deeply upon Saidar. &amp;n

  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="grasp2">
    <entry>
&amp;W(continued from grasp_release)&amp;n

Releasing the One Power is rather simple. One merely lets it go. The 
only difficulty is in wanting to let it go. That will be addressed more 
fully later when dangers of channeling are discussed. An example of 
releasing: 
.
&amp;cThe golden aura around Jane dims and then goes out as she releases 
Saidar with a soft sigh and a slightly wistful expression on her face.&amp;n 
.
Channeling has some inherent dangers. Saidar is addictive. Holding the 
Power fills one with a sense of well-being and ecstasy. There is a 
sweetness to Saidar that causes one to want to draw more and more of 
it. There is a point where the pleasure starts to turn to pain. This is 
the limit of what one can safely hold. Drawing any more runs the risk 
of burning out, losing the ability to channel forever, or dying. This 
same sweetness that causes one to want to draw more deeply on Saidar 
also causes one to not want to part from it. If one does not gradually 
build up a tolerance, she could become addicted, wanting nothing but to
hold Saidar. The extreme stages of this addiction lead to headaches, 
then comas, then death. This danger is one of the reasons that novices 
are not allowed to channel except under direct supervision during 
lessons. 
.
Channeling while fatigued is dangerous, as well. If tired, a channeler 
can lose control of the Power with results from merely losing their 
grasp to burning out and dying. Channeling while tired is further 
complicated by the fact that channeling is in itself a tiring activity, 
a deceptively tiring one. The rush that one feels from holding the 
Power makes it difficult to notice how much it is fatiquing her.

&amp;gHIERARCHY&amp;n
.
&amp;WThe Amyrlin Seat&amp;n
The woman chosen to lead the White Tower is the Amyrlin Seat. She is 
not always the strongest Aes Sedai. The politics of the Hall of the 
Tower can play a very large role in determining who becomes Amyrlin. 
She is also known by the titles Watcher of the Seals(although they 
aren&apos;t currently in the Tower) and Keeper of the Flame. She is at least 
the equal of kings and queens. Any ruler would come to Tar Valon if 
requested by the Amyrlin Seat. The Amyrlin Seat herself is a member of 
all the Ajahs, while at the same time a member of none. She is to 
represent all their interests, holding no Ajah above any other. The 
Amrylin should be addressed as &quot;Mother&quot;. The current Amyrlin of the 
White Tower is Elaida a&apos;Roihan, raised from the Red Ajah. The current 
Amyrlin in Salidar is Egwene al&apos;Vere, raised from no Ajah. She was 
raised to Amyrlin while an Accepted. 
.
.
&amp;WThe Keeper of the Chronicles&amp;n
The Keeper of the Chronicles is second in power to only the Amyrlin. 
The Keeper serves as the Amyrlins secretary, and speaks only for the 
Amyrlin Seat. Traditionally the Keeper comes from the same Ajah as the 
Amyrlin Seat but currently this isn&apos;t true. The Keeper in the White 
Tower is Alviarin Freidhen of the White Ajah. The Keeper in the Rebel 
Tower is ???. 
.
.
&amp;WAjah Heads&amp;n
The Head of an Ajah is a secret known only to those Aes Sedai within 
that Ajah. As leader of the Ajah, she technically outranks the other 
members. However, in public she would normally follow the same 
seniority rules as other Sisters in order to help conceal her identity 
from those outside the Ajah. Often, the Head will be a Sitter, but this 
is not always the case. 
.
.
&amp;WSitters&amp;n
Sitters are those Aes Sedai who sit in the Hall of the Tower and cast 
their votes in debates and issues facing the White Tower. There are 
usually 3 Sitters from each Ajah. A Sitter is normally deferred to by 
other Sisters. 
.
.
&amp;WMistress of Novices&amp;n
The Mistress of Novices is the Aes Sedai in charge of all aspects of 
Novice and Accepted life - their rota of chores and lessons, their 
rooms, and any punishments that need given. She keeps track of their 
behavior and progression through their lessons. The current Mistress of 
Novices in the White Tower is Jaiana Di&apos;ovranni-Alai Aneiya Riordan, of 
the Yellow Ajah. The current Mistress of Novices in the Rebel Tower is 
Lauriana al&apos;Veren, of the Yellow Ajah. 
.
.
&amp;WAes Sedai&amp;n
Aes Sedai are those women who have been raised to the shawl. They wear 
a shawl embroidered with the flame of Tar Valon, fringed in the color 
that represents their chosen Ajah, and the Great Serpent ring on the 
finger of their choice. They should be addressed as &quot;Aes Sedai&quot; by 
Novices, and &quot; Sedai&quot; by Accepted. Seniority is determined amongst the 
Sedai by a number of factors, such as strength in the One Power, how 
long the Sister was a Novice and how long she was an Accepted. 
.
.
&amp;WAccepted&amp;n
Accepted are those who have passed the testing in the ring Ter&apos;angreal, 
and are a step closer to becoming Aes Sedai. They wear simple dresses 
of white banded in the seven colors of the Ajahs, and the Great Serpent 
ring on the third finger of their left hand. Their time is spent more 
in study, and they have more control over their own studies and 
movements than do Novices. (NOTE: Accepted of the White Tower no longer 
have a blue stripe on their dresses, as all symbols of the Blue Ajah 
have been eliminated from the Tower. Rebel Accepted do not pass through 
the testing ter&apos;angreal, as the rebels do not have access to it.) 
.
.
&amp;WNovices&amp;n
Novices are those who wish to train to become Aes Sedai. They wear 
simple dresses of white and are aren&apos;t allowed to wear jewelry of any 
kind or have weapons. They spend almost every hour of the day working, 
either doing chores (washing clothes in the laundry, scrubbing 
pots/preparing meals in the kitchen, sweeping the garden paths) or in 
lessons/studying.

&amp;gHISTORY&amp;n
.
The Age of Legends was a time of miracles, when all things were 
possible and both men and women served as Aes Sedai (&quot;Servant of All&quot; 
in the Old Tongue). During this prosperous age, one of the most 
powerful Aes Sedai was born and came to prominence
 his name was Lews 
Therin Telamon, the Dragon. He was unique beyond being Aes Sedai, for 
he was a Ta&apos;veren. 
.
The easiest method of describing Ta&apos;veren is to say that they are a 
focal point for the pattern. They often have no control over this and 
have even less control over their own actions than those who aren&apos;t 
Ta&apos;veren, and they can often appear to be very lucky in that things 
seem to go their way. It&apos;s not just that they are simply lucky, it&apos;s 
that the pattern forces events such that the Ta&apos;veren ends up where the
pattern needs him. 
.
It is not known how long Lews Therin led the Aes Sedai before 
destruction occurred, but as Aes Sedai led lives more than 500 years 
long it could be any significant amount of time. He ruled and the land 
prospered until a group of slighted Aes Sedai began to uproot some 
secrets that would affect all time - chiefly among these secrets was 
the existence of a power, equal in strength to the Creator, known as 
Shai&apos;tan, or the Great Lord of the Dark. This divinity had been sealed 
in a prison at the moment of creation, destined to lead an existence 
cut off from the world, with no influence or control. 
.
The event that was to begin the conflict between the forces of good and 
evil was the bore, the hole drilled by Lanfear and another Forsaken 
into the prison of the Dark One. This action caused the war to begin 
immediately for although Shai&apos;tan was still constrained in the prison 
his hand could reach out and affect the world. Lews Therin rallied the 
forces of the Light, it&apos;s backbone the Aes Sedai and it&apos;s regular 
troops as newly trained soldiers. No violent crime had been committed 
for a long period of time before the war, thus the need for troops was 
non-existent, putting the Light at a distinct disadvantage at the 
beginning of the war. 
.
The Forsaken began to construct their own army, using powers from the 
Dark One and their own twisted skill, to form creatures of nightmarish 
aspect. Chiefly among these experiments were Trollocs, Myrddraal, 
Draghkar, Darkhounds, and Gray men. (see later lectures). 
.
The war began, the Light with the Aes Sedai and soldiers drawn from the 
land against the Shadow with all it&apos;s twisted evil. The war lasted a 
bloody ten years, desperate battle fought after desperate battle, the 
Light losing almost every confrontation. Slowly the Aes Sedai began to 
understand the full implications of their dilemma, and they began to 
construct objects of the power to aid them in their struggle. Known as 
Angreal, Ter&apos;angreal and Sa&apos;angreal, these objects allowed the wielder 
to draw more of the One Power, greatly increasing the wielder&apos;s 
effectiveness. They can generally be used by either a man or a woman 
but not both. Sa&apos;ngreal are stronger versions of angreal, and are less 
common. Both of these require that the channeler touch them while 
channeling, and they will allow the channeler to draw much more of the 
Source than they could otherwise. Ter&apos;angreal are made for a specific 
purpose, such as putting someone to sleep. There are many more 
ter&apos;angreal than the other two. Some of them can be used by men, some 
by women, some by either, and some do not require an ability to channel 
at all. The use and function of most ter&apos;angreal is unknown, and it can
 be extremely dangerous to experiment with these unknowns. Note - 
*angreals were made before the war, just far far less often, and with 
less intent to do harm.

Unfortunately, not even these new weapons were able to stop the advance 
of the Shadow, and city after city, country after country fell into 
darkness and despair. During the last two years of conflict Lews Therin 
proposed to the rest of the Aes Sedai that they pool their strength, to 
strike one massive blow at the heart of the conflict, the bore at 
Shayol Ghul. This plan managed to split the Hall of Servants into two 
armed camps, the supporters of Lews Therin, mostly consisting of men, 
while the others who argued that they should continue fighting as they 
had done before. 
.
Finally, Lews Therin decided to end The War of Power by his own means, 
without permission from the Hall. His band of Aes Sedai, now called the 
Hundred Companions, as well as a group of 10,000 military men, struck 
at the heart of the Shadow. As it happened all thirteen forsaken were 
at the bore holding a council of some sort. Lews Therin&apos;s attack caught
them completely off-guard and before the forsaken could strike they 
were bound and sealed when Lews Therin and his Hundred Companions 
sealed the Bore on the prison. 
.
The ramifications of Lews Therin&apos;s actions would be immediately felt, 
as all who struck and sealed the Dark One were grabbed and smashed by 
the Dark One&apos;s counter-stroke. Instead of striking at the Aes Sedai 
themselves the Great Lord of the Dark tainted the male half of the True 
Source, effectively placing a curse upon the male Aes Sedai of madness 
and a death from rot. All the male channelers at the sealing went 
instantly insane turning what was a glorious victory into nothing but 
ashes. 
.
The consequences of the counter-stroke affected all male channelers, 
driving some immediately mad while others managed to handle the taint 
for a few years. Before the male Aes Sedai could die they smashed all 
around them, smashing whole cities and destroying miles of land around 
themselves in obliterating blasts of power. Then, what is now called 
the Breaking of the World began, for the very foundations upon which 
the world stood were changed, and this change was sudden, violent, and 
deadly.

&amp;W(continued from ghelp 50 history2)&amp;n

As the world began to break apart the people began to scatter to all 
ends of the planet in vain attempts to find shelter and peace, Lews 
Therin, fully wrapped in madness, returned to his home and began to 
destroy all around him, killing his wife, children, and all his friends
who had been there through the war. Ever after this day he would be 
known as the Kinslayer, the man who broke the world, the Dragon of 
prophecy. The war was over, ten years of bloody, horrific, bitter 
struggle, completed and won for the Light, but the cost was tremendous.
.
The Age of Legends would end in the following years, the glories and 
marvels of countless generations vanishing like a mirage as knowledge 
and technology disappeared - the lands began to shatter and people and 
hope began to die. The Ogier, the gentle giants that were only humanoid 
in shape but long lived unlike humans - allies of the Light throughout 
the war - vanished into their Steddings, peaceful abodes that offered 
protection from the madness and chaos of the outside world. Many male 
Aes Sedai went with the Ogier, the Steddings blocking the ability to 
channel, and these accursed men were able to live awhile without fear 
of a rotting death. 
.
However, these men, who had so recently been the strongest influences 
across worlds soon left the Ogier sanctuaries, unable to resist the 
call of the power and the need to channel it. The Nym, whose bodies 
were made of bark and leaf and who were brothers to the Ogier, slowly 
began to die out, their immortality gone at the end of the war. Only 
one of the Nym would survive the cataclysm, his task to guard a pure 
pool of Saidin known as the Eye of the World. The Aiel, (&quot;dedicated&quot; in 
the Old Tongue) once the servants of the Aes Sedai, pledged to peace, 
fled with the treasures of the Aes Sedai - objects given into Aiel 
trust for safe keeping, while the world broke around them. 
.
The death of Lews Therin Telamon came early in the Breaking. In his 
death throes he called down a mighty blast of power to smite himself 
where he stood on an endless rolling field of grassland. A great black 
mountain was created where he struck, the ground heaving it into 
existence, a mountain that would cast a shadow across a river and over 
an island that would be where the Aes Sedai began again. This mountain 
would be called Dragonmount, the place of the Dragon&apos;s rebirth, while 
the island would be named Tar Valon, the tower that guards, awaiting 
his coming. 
.
In the years that followed the White Tower of Tar Valon was formed, 
built by Elisane Tishar, first Amyrlin Seat. The influence of the Aes 
Sedai grew until few nations rulers were without Aes Sedai advisors, 
greatly due to the fact that all Aes Sedai now swore three oaths - to 
speak no word that is not true, to make no weapon for one man to kill 
another, and to use the One Power as a weapon against only Shadowspawn,
or in the last defense of her life, the life of her Warder, or that of 
another Aes Sedai. These oaths were binding, and one who had sworn 
could NOT break them. 
.
The purpose of the Aes Sedai now is much the same as it was in the past
- as a Servant of All. They are healers and guides, advisors kings and 
queens, keepers of lost knowledge, and each Ajah within the Tower has 
its own specific purpose.

&amp;gNovice Rules, Behavior and Etiquette&amp;n
.
Novices should curtsey to all Aes Sedai and Accepted, and be respectful
at all times. This includes never interrupting when an Aes Sedai or 
Accepted is speaking, never turning away if they are being spoken to, 
and answering all questions straight away and truthfully. They can 
leave only when dismissed. 
.
Novices should use common sense and discretion when dealing with males 
of any rank. Chatting about the weather in a public place is perfectly 
acceptable. Canoodling in a private corner of the garden is not. 
.
A novice must never grasp Saidar without permission or supervision by 
an Aes Sedai or Accepted. 
.
Novices must never leave the the village without permission.
.
There are other things that a novice will learn through time about both 
her attitude and behavior. Before being raised to Accepted, Novices 
should know about composure, for example not looking at the ground 
constantly, acting with a little grace and decorum, having good table 
manners and neatness of appearance.

&amp;CHarden Air:&amp;n Flows of Air used to form a hard surface. This can be used 
for various things. Flows of air tightly woven into a hard disc can 
form a shield to deflect blows. The same type of barrier can be 
expanded out to form a wall. Offensively, hardened air can be formed 
into a club for use as a weapon. [Note: see the three oaths] It can 
also be formed into a switch or whip-like construct. 
.
&amp;cJane channels flows of Air into a tightly spun disc. There is a slight 
shimmering in front of her as the air hardens just in time to deflect 
the incoming stone. &amp;n
.
&amp;CBind:&amp;n Bands of air can be used to immobilize a target or to hold 
objects in place. Combined with hardened air, it can be used to gag, 
blindfold or stop the ears of a target. 
.
&amp;cJane channels out thick bands of Air, attempting to loop them around 
Joe and pin his arms to his sides. &amp;n
.
&amp;CLift:&amp;n This is the most common use for Air. It is similar to bind, 
except that once the target is &quot;grabbed&quot; it is then lifted. Weight 
directly affects difficulty. The heavier the target and the higher it 
is lifted, the more power is required. Lifting a person is difficult, 
although it is doable, especially by someone who is strong enough to 
gate. However, lifting them more than a couple of yards would be a 
herculean task unless the person is small or the channeler is of 
Forsaken caliber strength. 
.
&amp;cJane wraps flows of Air tightly around the kettle. Slowly and 
carefully, she lifts it from the table, the glow of Saidar around her 
increasing in intensity as she begins to draw more deeply on the One 
Power. &amp;n
.
&amp;RHeat:&amp;n Thin flows of Fire are woven into an object to heat it. Excellent
for heating water for tea. 
.
&amp;cJane channels thin threads of Fire, passing them through the kettle 
slowly and carefully until a thin stream of steam begins to rise from 
the spout. &amp;n
.
&amp;RFlame:&amp;n A single thread of Fire is looped or twisted at the end to 
concentrate it and produce a visible flame. 
.
&amp;cJane holds her hands cupped in front of her and channels a slender 
thread of Fire into the hollow formed by her fingers. She forms the 
thread into a loop and gradually increases the intensity of the flow 
until a small flame appears and flickers above her palms. &amp;n

&amp;cJane adjusts her shawl more snugly about her shoulders and then focuses 
her attention on the fireplace. The glow of Saidar slowly envelopes her

she pours more strength into it until, after a moment, the log bursts 
into flames. &amp;n

&amp;RWarm Room:&amp;n This is a complex web of fine threads of Fire used to warm 
the air. This weave should not be tied off and left unattended, lest it 
get out of hand and start a fire. 
.
&amp;cJane&apos;s breath is visible in the chill air of her bedchamber as she 
concentrates on spinning out the fine tendrils of Fire until they reach 
all corners of the room. After just a few moments, the room is toasty 
warm. She releases the weave and finally slips out from beneath her 
heavy, down-filled comforter.&amp;n 
.
&amp;yShape Stone:&amp;n Flows of Earth can be used to rearrange the composition of 
dirt, metal or stone in order to reshape it. Basically, it is sculpting 
using just the One Power. Size of the task affects the difficulty. 
Bending a sword blade would probably not be very hard, especially if 
you just make the metal soft and malleable in one small spot and then 
use flows of air for the actual bending. Rearranging a large boulder 
into a statue would be a good deal more difficult, and the One Power in 
no way guarantees artistic ability. 
.
&amp;cJane studies the marble plaque, a frown of concentration marring her 
Aes Sedai serenity. She carefully weaves light flows of Earth into the 
stone, gradually smoothing away the inscription. In mere moments, Joe&apos;s 
engraved protestations of undying love are no more.&amp;n 
.
&amp;yDelve Ores:&amp;n Probing flows of earth are used to find and identify ores 
in the ground. The ability is very rare in women. 
.
&amp;cAfter several moments of carefully probing the closed box&apos;s contents 
with threads of Earth, Jane looks up and announces,&apos;It contains a piece 
of coal, a copper farthing and a silver mark.&apos; &amp;n

&amp;BDry:&amp;n Flows of water can be used to move moisture out of hair, clothing, 
etc. This is probably the most common use to which simple weaves of 
Water are put in the books. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves threads of Water carefully through Joe&apos;s drenched clothing, 
drawing the moisture out and causing it to gather in a pool at his feet 
leaving his fancy, silk coat dry, but ruined. &amp;n
.
&amp;BMove Water:&amp;n Flows of Water can be used to move liquid around. This is 
useful for gathering up a spill or stirring. 
.
&amp;cJane channels flows of Water into the puddle, causing it to gather up 
into a quivering ball about the size of her head. Gently, she lifts it 
with a cradling web of Air and slowly moves it to the window where she 
releases it, allowing it to splash onto the ground below.&amp;n 
.
&amp;BCreate Water:&amp;n Flows of water can be used to coax moisture from the air. 
The difficulty would be determined by how humid the air is and how much 
water one is attempting to create. This would not be terribly easy, 
even under ideal circumstances. 
.
&amp;cJane concentrates and forms a web made of tendrils of Water, radiating 
to all corners of the room, but centered over her small tea cup. She 
uses the weave to gradually coax moisture from the air of the room, 
along the weave to the cup. After a few moments, droplets of water 
begin to fall from the center of the web into the cup, slowly filling 
it. &amp;n
.
&amp;YBall of Light:&amp;n Air is used to form the hollow shell or ball. A fine 
thread of Fire is then looped inside the shell to produce the light. 
.
&amp;cJane holds her hands in front of her about a foot apart with the palms 
facing each other. She spins out a thread of Air and weaves it into a 
mesh-like ball in the middle of the space between her hands. Carefully, 
she inserts a thin filament of Fire into the hollow sphere and loops 
it, pulsing energy along the thread causing the entire construct to 
glow with a soft light. &amp;n

&amp;gTHEORIES OF FLOW INTERACTION&amp;n
.
The purpose of this presentation is to supply the student with a 
knowledge of how the different flows react with each other so that the 
channeler may more easily determine which flows to use in each weave. 
Since Robert Jordan was not consulted in this matter, it is all just 
opinion and speculation. Hopefully, it will be usefull to our guild.
.
Each of the five flows has attributes which determine how it reacts 
with the other flows. Aptitude with Fire and Earth is more common in 
men, so we will refer to these flows as masculine. In general, the use 
of Water and Air come more easily to women. We will label these as 
feminine. Fire and Air are more energetic flows, so will be referred to 
as active. Water and Earth embody the passive principle. Spirit is not 
masculine or feminine. It also seems to function in an active or 
passive role, depending on what is needed. 
.
&amp;RFIRE&amp;n      masculine/active
.
Fire is used to control heat energy, adding or removing it from a
weave. Care should be taken when using Fire to remove heat, as drawing
the energy into one&apos;s self is dangerous and very often fatal. It reacts
with other flows as follows:
Air -- These two flows tend to compliment and strengthen each other. 
Adding the two actives tends to make them even more active. The 
male/female aspects support each other. To burn strongly, a fire needs
air.
.

Earth -- The tension and conflict caused by both being male, but one 
active and one passive, can cause explosive reactions if twined 
closely.
.
Water -- These two flows are diametrically opposite. Combining them
can result in violent, energetic reactions.
Spirit -- Combination with spirit can produce various effects.
.
.
&amp;CAIR&amp;n        feminine/active
.
Controls wind movements and can be used to manipulate objects as if an
extra appendage. Where fire is heat energy, Air is kinetic energy.
Interactions:
.
Fire -- Already dealt with under the fire discussion.
.
Earth -- These are complete opposites, like fire and water. They react
vigorously, although not as violently as would fire and water because
the active principle in this reaction is feminine.
.
Water -- Both are feminine, which can cause conflict. However, they can
also support one another. The passive nature of water can provide a 
foundation for strengthening the actions of the air element.
.
Spirit -- As always, combination with spirit can produce different 
results depending on how it is used.
.
.
&amp;yEARTH&amp;n      masculine/passive
.
Earth is used for manipulating solids. It is passive, forming a
foundation for other flows to build upon or react with. It controls
cohesion, being used to reinforce and strengthen or to weaken and
crumble.
.
Fire -- Dealt with in the fire discussion.
.
Air -- Dealt with in the air discussion.
.
Water -- These flows are complimentary, much as Fire and Air are. One
is masculine and the other feminine, causing them to mesh well, while
they are both passive which causes no conflicts. 
.
Spirit -- Various results.
.
.
&amp;BWATER&amp;n      feminine/passive
.
Much like earth, water controls cohesion, providing support or 
undermining the structure of a weave. Because of the feminine nature, it is more likely to provide support than to be used destructively. It 
is also used to manipulate liquids.
.
The way water reacts with the other flows has already been addressed in
the sections for those various flows, with the exception of Spirit, 
which reacts in various different ways depending on how it is used and
what is needed.
.
.
&amp;WSPIRIT&amp;n
.
Spirit is neither masculine nor feminine. It can act passively or 
actively or even neutrally. It can act as a catalyst to increase the
effects of other flows, or it can dampen them. Its realm is life energy
and things dealing with the one power itself.
