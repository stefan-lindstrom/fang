    <desc>Otherwise known as the Great Game of Houses or simply as the Great Game 
and in the Old Tongue, Daes Dae&apos;mar.  It is the scheming, plots and 
manipulations for advantage by noble Houses.  Great value is given to 
subtlety, to aiming at one thing while seeming to aim at another, and 
to achieving ends with the least visible effort.
All nations play the Great Game, some more than others.  The Cairhien 
country plays the Game to its highest art form.  That is not to say 
there are not players of the Game that are just as good as those found 
in Cairhien, but rather as a group the Cairhienans play the best.  Even 
the servants in Cairhien play their own version of the Game.  Andorans
are the reluctant players, playing the Game when it is necessary.  The 
Borderlands are at the opposite end of the spectrum, considering 
themselves above the Game and maintain that they do not play.  The key 
is to appear as if one is not playing a game.  To say and do things 
with hints to other things make Daes Dae&apos;mar an art form, but to 
misinterpret those subtleties can mean death.

In &quot;HELP DAES&quot; you can find a list of some of the tools used in the
Great Game. It is by no means an exhaustive list.  You are limited only
by your imagination.

    <reqs>The Houses is a unique guild that spans a wide variety of different roleplayer types and professions.  In most cases you will need to be affliated with a House.
Basic REQs are as follows:
1)   You must be Level 20.
2)   You must have an approved background submitted to me at tordenmdl@hotmail.com
3)   You must have an acceptable description.
4)   You must have Houses members sponsorship as follows:  Nobility and Channelers and Dark Friends must have 5 sponsors.  Everyone else must have 3 sponsors.  From the time of acceptance to seek Houses, you have 30 days to obtain all sponsorships.  One of the sponsors must be the head of the House you are seeking to enter.  Other special circumstances may apply and it is best to discuss seeking this guild with the GL before submission of a background and again after submission of the background.
NOTES
1)   From time to time there may be a freeze or limit on positions such as nobles, guards or servants, etc. This is to help balance the positions within the guild.  Ask the GL if such a freeze is in place before seeking.
2)   The guild maintains a ratio of channelers to non channelers in the guild.  Please note that it is very difficult to guild a channeler into the Houses guild.  If this is your first alt to guild in Houses, it is highly recommended that it NOT be a channeler.  Since there is a ratio, you may have to wait for a opening guild a channeler.  A more detailed background will be expected as well as excellant RP skills reflecting a mature player.
3)   Dark Friends, Channelers and all Nobility will be held to a higher standard of Role Play.  Houses is a RP intensive guild.  It is also expected that you are able to generate your own RP and are able to facilitate the RP of others within and between guilds.   Houses is considered a RP intensive guild.
4)   It helps you greatly to know the customs, clothing, food, weapons, manners and sayings of your country.  If you are seeking nobility, it is expected you will know about the historical and current political climate of your country as well as its economics.
5)   Houses has a culture all of its own.  If this is your first time to guild in Houses, please expect to spend some time with the GL or senior guild members before and after guilding to be properly enculturated.  This is not always possible to do, but it is the preferred standard.
6)   Houses are based upon those in the books.  Please know the House and position you are seeking before sending the GL a background of your alt.
7)   Higher ranks are usually based upon time spent in the lower ranks.  Time spent
in the guild role playing will positively affect your rank and priviledges, as well as the quality and quantity of your RP.  Idling and inactivity leads to demotion and deguilding.
If you have any questions about Daes Dae&apos;mar guild, please feel free to mud mail Dravin, email me at tordenmdl@hotmail.com or send me a message when you see me on line.

    <gossip>17 September 2000

Servants will talk and rumors will spread. That is especially the case in
Cairhien. The latest gossip has it that the Regent met with a couple of 
minor nobles of her house. Details are sketchy at best, but there was
apparently a small altercation, perhaps more than one.

Successful use of this skill negates hunger and thirst. You&apos;ll never
need to buy food again.

  <ghelp keyword="throw">
    <entry>THROW
This is an attack skill. You must be wielding a throwable weapon in
your right hand for it to work. The format is: throw victim target.
The targets are listed below, the difficulty is how much it lowers 
your chance to hit. The modifier is how much the damage is multiplied
by if you hit.
      target     difficulty  modifier
      head          -40        3.5 
      chest         -20        2.5 
      stomach       -25        3.0 
      arm           -15        1.0 
      leg           -15        1.5 
      eye           -70        8.0 
If you have a high hitroll, targetting the eye can yield some nice 
results. Don&apos;t forget to pick up your thrown weapon afterwards.
NOTE: Do not use this skill until the bug is fixed. As it is right now when
used against a mob, it is more likely to boost their hitpoints than it is to
damage them due to the way ABS is checked.
</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="arrest">
    <entry>ARREST

This skill will arrest your victim for 3 + (your level)/20 ticks. While
arrested the person cannot attack or be attacked. Also, they are unable
to use the following commands:   east west south north up down flee
recall rest sleep sit enter leave follow home mount drag push run taxi
jump kill bash backstab kick trip steal sneak assist hit stab rescue
punch dirtkick shoot stun bandmarch

</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="fine">
    <entry>FINE

This skill allows you to take money from another character. The format
is: fine person amount. The skill works like steal gold, except that
the victim gets a message and you determine the amount to be stolen.
The skill will inform you if the person does not have enough to pay the
fine.

</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="armscry">
    <entry>ARMSCRY

Calls three guard mobs and groups them with you. They will follow your
orders as if charmed for 15 ticks. These mobs are 25th level, have 
somewhere in the 1000 to 1500 range in hitpoints and have two attacks.

</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="tail">
    <entry>TAIL

This skill allows you to follow someone without their knowledge. 
They do not get a message when you start tailing them, and if they
attempt to group all, you will not be grouped. It also sets you as
sneaking, regardless of whether you have the sneak skill.

It is not quite as effective as shadow or inquisition, as those set
you as hidden, also. On the other hand, you have to know sneak and
hide for those skills to work.
