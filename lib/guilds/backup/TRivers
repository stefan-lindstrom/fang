    <desc>With the trollocs and other shadowspawn invading the sleepy farmland
of the Two Rivers, and led by Lord Perrin &apos;Goldeneyes&apos; Aybara, the
people of Two Rivers have formed a small army, to protect their family
and homes, and also so as not to rely on whitecloaks for protection.
This motley crew of farmers and housewives has started to develop into
a &apos;real&apos; army, with ranks and uniforms, though for the most part,
ranks are merely dressing, and uniform no more so. The ranks have been
further strengthened by the arrival of refugees and travelers from 
many other countries.
In the army, divisions in infantry, and cavalry are of similar
calibre to other armies, but the strength of the Two Rivers lies in the
awesome range, speed, power and accuracy of the Two Rivers longbow. This
bow, taller than the average
Two Riversman, can fire an arrow more than 300 yards, with pinpoint
accuracy, and the power to pierce full plate armor, the chest of the
poor soul, and the plate armor a second time as it protrudes through
the corpse&apos;s back. This weapon, combined with a Two Riversman&apos;s
tracking and hunting ability, makes them natural snipers and scouts. 

In the community, the Two Rivers population has been boosted by the
steady flow of outsiders. Blacksmiths, weavers, fletchers, tailors,
every man, woman, and child in the Two Rivers is part of a giant
family, working hard, and having fun, to make the most of life in
such a turbulent time.

  and to ICly establish your presence in the group. At least one of the
  two sponsors must be someone other than Aram or Jeren.

  anyone, except perhaps other female channelers.

  (eg. Aes Sedai, Children of the Light) in the world. Also list some
  strengths and flaws for your character - try to make them fairly
  balanced. The goal is an interesting background that is also credible.
- Let us know (in the email accompanying the background) how much time you
  would be willing to devote to playing this character. Just a rough idea of
  your activity is enough.

    <gossip>-Recruiters in Caemlyn-

Latest rumours around the Two Rivers is that
Lord Perrin &apos;Goldeneyes&apos; Aybara has sent men
to Caemlyn to spread word of Manetheren rising.
These men are also recruiting for their army,
and as such are also looking for more smiths,
fletchers, weavers and farmers to help provide
the increasing army with supplies and goods.
Offering a fertile and plentiful land, with
blademaster instructors, master smiths and
unparalleled hunting and tracking prowess,
this young Ta&apos;veren seems to be pulling the
men he needs to him, and more besides.
