    <desc>     The story of the Band of the Red Hand has lived on since the time
of the Trolloc Wars. The legendary army was the last to fall in the final
defense of Manetheren and King Eamon himself, their defeat signifying the
collapse of that great nation.
     The name has been taken on by a new army. This new Band was formed
when Matrim Cauthon saved a group of soldiers who otherwise would have
died in a battle against the Shaido Aiel in Cairhien. Mat is now known as
one of the greatest tactical minds of this, or perhaps any other time, as
his planning reflects a style not seen since the Trolloc Wars, and the
Band has not suffered one defeat under his leadership.
     Another thing the Band&apos;s success has been attributed to is Mat&apos;s
incredible luck. He is ta&apos;veren, and has been known to win almost without
fail at dice, or any game of chance.
     The Band is made up of 6 divisions: Infantry (or Swordsmen),
Pikemen, Cavalry, Crossbows, Medics and Scouts. The Band&apos;s main strength
is teamwork, both in combat and out. Although the Band is based mainly in
Salidar now, Mat has been known to call a move on a whim, and within a
very short time the camp is packed up and ready to move.
As the original basis of the Band was a number of soldiers from
Cairhien and Tear, the Band now accepts recruits from all nationalities,
as long as they are willing to fight amongst a group considered sworn to
the Dragon.

    <reqs>&amp;BRequirements for joining the &amp;RBand.&amp;n
&amp;G1.&amp;n First, have to have a character description written and
approved by the GL of the Band.
&amp;G2.&amp;n Send in a background of your character, include details such as:
Where you were born, are you ic&apos;ly seeking the band, or just ooc&apos;ly,
what is your character like, what does he/she believe in, stance on the
Lord Dragon, etc. What sort of training, if any, you have had.
&amp;G3.&amp;n You have to be at least level 20 to be guilded, and any unusual rp
aspects, such as whether your character is a darkfriend or Ogier
need to also be included and approved with the background.

    <gossip>&amp;w8-15-00&amp;n
&amp;yRumors swirl around the Ball and Hoop, late last night the General
was seen speaking to a man wearing a black cloak.  Shortly afterwards, the
General was seen leaving accompanied by three members of his Redarm
guards.  Some hours later Mat returned to the Ball and Hoop, spoke briefly
to some of the officers then left again, this time for a night long
drinking and dicing binge.&amp;n

It&apos;s true!  The story that Captain Brenna has returned to Caemlyn must
be true after all.  A young recruit was overheard reporting to the General
that the Captain was seen in company of a Swordsman in the Ball and Hoop,
though when Lord Mat went to see her, they were both gone.  Is it possible
the recruit was seeing things?  Where could they have got to and why?

The trees whisper, whisper that a prominent member of the Band has
been arrested in Salidar for spying on an Aes Sedai, but why?  And on whom&apos;s
orders...?

Over drinks, bandie&apos;s gossiped - the Medic&apos;s Commander hadn&apos;t been seen
at her usual spot by the beerkeg last night.  She&apos;d been seen returning with
Commander Tidder, in a rather foul mood, this morning.  Well into his drink,
a young recruit was finally bullied into revealing that he&apos;d carried a dispatch
intended for the General that afternoon, and about the nicest words he
could repeat were &quot;bloody fool Aes Sedai&quot; and &quot;nail his ears to the floor&quot;.
Not surprisingly when Ash did turn up that night, nobody was brave or drunk
enough to ask!

  <ghelp keyword="Scouting_Basics">
    <entry>&amp;ySCOUTING BASICS&amp;n

 &amp;y-&amp;nPurpose: Obtain information, as well as track and locate individuals
(or items) sought after by the Band of the Red Hand, for whatever 
reason.
 &amp;W*&amp;nTracking: Demonstrate ability to track in wilderness and urban
settings.  Decipher different tracks, uncover hidden tracks, spot false
trails and so on.  Also be prepared to demonstrate ability to hide your
own tracks.
 &amp;W*&amp;nTailing: Aside from tracking, tailing suspects (for whatever
reason) is a necessary talent to have in your bag of tricks.  If you&apos;re
not good at this, you&apos;ll probably wind up dead anyways.
 &amp;W*&amp;nStealth: Demonstrate skills in blending into your surroundings,
whether it be in a crowd or in the woods, a good scout can hide in
plain sight if he/she wants to.  A good scout will use his/her backdrop
to their advantage without fail.
 &amp;W*&amp;nDisguise: Combined with stealth, invaluable.  Used while
tailing someone, not only innovative, but wise.  Caution is something
that should be second nature to a scout.
 &amp;W*&amp;nInquisitive/attentive nature: Knowing how to question some-
one without actually seeming as though you are doing so is a craft
to be honed.  Listen to everyone and everything, do not dismiss
any snippit of information irregardless of how insignifigant or downright
ridiculous it seems.
 &amp;W*&amp;nSelf defense/fighting ability: Necessary for obvious reasons.
Better to undergo this training while still a recruit before becoming
a full time scout for the Band.

    <entry>&amp;yGUILD SKILLS FOR THE BAND&amp;n

 &amp;RTactics:&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;nTactics is dependant upon being grouped (with other Bandies
who also have Tactics as a guildskill preferably), but as long as you&apos;re
grouped it works.  It decreases your AC by 5 and for each group
member that also has Tactics, your AC gets another decrease of 5.
Tactics caps at a MAX of -40 AC affection however.
&amp;W*&amp;nAutomatic skill, once grouped.

 &amp;RBrace:&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;nBrace decreases the damage you take by your_level/10, so if
you&apos;re level 100, 100/10= 10 less damage.
&amp;W*&amp;nAutomatic skill.

 &amp;RFlank:&amp;n
Usage: flank &lt;target&gt;
&amp;y-&amp;nFlank is an extra attack, it cannot be used to initiate a fight, only
during a codefight.  It does an additional 4-40(random) damage to
your target, and also leaves the target sitting.
&amp;W*&amp;nThe rate of success increases with your skill %.
&amp;W*&amp;nCannot be used in rapid succession, in otherwords, there&apos;s
a waiting period before you may use it again, just like with say, Trip
or Stun.

 &amp;RStrike:&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;nStrike gives you a 25% or 1 in 4 chance to do double damage to
a target.  This skill doubles the damroll of the weapon wielded, so
if you&apos;re wielding the guild sword (10d10), taking a random value
from 10 to 100, there&apos;s potential for a 20 to 200 damage bonus.
&amp;W*&amp;nAutomatic skill.

 &amp;RAim:&amp;n
Usage: aim &lt;target&gt;
&amp;y-&amp;nAim multiplies damage to target by 3 if successful.  It&apos;s
necessary to have a weapon wielded, as this skill multiplies your
weapon&apos;s damage by 3.  So if you&apos;re using the two-handed guild
sword (10d10), then it takes a random value from 10 to 100
and triples it.  Potential for a 30 to 300 damage bonus.
&amp;W*&amp;n If you&apos;re using the one handed guild sword, wield it
in your left hand, as the skill goes to the left handed weapon
first, then to the right handed one.  (Only affects one weapon)
&amp;W*&amp;nRate of success is dependant on your skill %.

 &amp;RBandmarch:&amp;n
Usage: bandmarch &lt;room name/#&gt;
&amp;y-&amp;nThis skill essentially acts just like cart does, although
there&apos;s no charge to the guildie as they are merely &quot;marching&quot;
codewise and not hiring a cart.  Also very similiar to seek, the
main difference being, seek uses player/mob names, whereas,
as stated above, this skill uses room names and numbers.
Another bonus is it also works in !GATE flagged rooms and cart
does not.

    <entry>&amp;yBAND ETIQUETTE AND PROTOCOL&amp;n

&amp;y-&amp;n basic rank structure (excluding scouts)
&amp;W*&amp;n Recruit
&amp;W*&amp;n First Rank
&amp;W*&amp;n Veteran (or Medic)
&amp;W*&amp;n Bannerman (or Chirirgeon)
&amp;W*&amp;n Fileleader (or Field Doctor)
&amp;W*&amp;n Captain
&amp;W*&amp;n Commander
&amp;y-&amp;n dealing with lower and higher ranks: all must obey the orders
of a higher ranks soldier, high-ranked soldiers are responsible
  for the orders they give. Those who do not obey or those who
  abuse this power will face strict punishment.
&amp;y-&amp;n saluting: how to salute (no set way), demonstrate hand-to-
forehead and fist-to-chest methods as suggestions.
&amp;W*&amp;n Never salute or refer to another soldier by rank when outside
the camp or other Band-specific areas or combat.
&amp;W*&amp;n Always salute/use rank when dealing with those of higher
  rank inside the camp, unless instructed otherwise. 
&amp;W*&amp;n During battle show respect at all times, including salutes
  where appropriate and use of ranks.
&amp;y-&amp;n rules at different ranks: 
&amp;W*&amp;n Recruits are not permitted to leave the camp/training area
  unless under the full supervision of a soldier of higher rank. 
&amp;W*&amp;n Once you have been promoted to First Rank, you are allowed
  to leave the camp as you wish. Long trips, however, are 
  expected to be cleared by a proper official (The General,
  Captain of the Redarms, Commanders or others of sufficiently
  high rank).
&amp;W*&amp;n Recruits are to obey *all* orders given to them, no matter how
  trivial, however, if the order is truly abusive of the chain of
  command (ie polishing shoes or whatever) then it may be
  reported. 
&amp;W*&amp;n Chain of command must always be observed. The orders of a
  Fileleader do not directly overwrite the orders of a Captain.
&amp;W*&amp;n Redarms are the Band&apos;s policing unit, usually employed when
the Band is travelling cross-country and through towns.
  Everyone above first rank will be a redarm at some point, as it
  rotates through all Band members (can explain the principle if
you want to). They resolve all intra-Band conflicts, as well as
settling problems with non-soldiers and paying for damages.
&amp;W*&amp;nWhile on probation, a Band member loses all rights and
  priviledges and must defer to the person of highest rank,
  regardless of what they were before.

    <entry>&amp;yTACTICS FUNDAMENTALS SYLLABUS&amp;n

&amp;y-&amp;n basic working of each division.
 &amp;mSwordsmen:&amp;n used in both attack and defense. Basic fighting
  unit, skilled in one-on-one and group fighting tactics. Mobile
  and effective up close.
 &amp;mPikemen:&amp;n mostly used to defend against charging (using 
  technique shown in pike lessons), disadvantaged in attack by
  weapon size. Weapon can be used as either a staff or a spear
  in attack/defense.
 &amp;mCavalry:&amp;n best used in attack as a charge. Horseback gives
  power advantage and height advantage, but at the cost of
  mobility in close-quarters combat with footmen.
 &amp;mCrossbowmen:&amp;n mostly used for distance attack, sometimes 
  known to ride in with cavalry. Crossbow bolts not of much use 
  in close-quarter combat.
 &amp;mMedics:&amp;n dedicated to healing, from performing minor first aid on
  the battlefield to major surgery in the camp. Would be a
  liability if unable to hold their own in battle, so trained to use
  their large knives in close-quarter combat.
 &amp;mScouts:&amp;n used for gathering information and items of interest
  outside of battle. Information can include battlefield lay-out,
  surrounding areas, army movements nearby, etc. During
  battle they are used for messaging and reporting on 
  attack/defense progress and battlefield information.

&amp;y-&amp;n first aid: 
&amp;W*&amp;n positioning of injured: lay flat on back, support head with an
item of clothing if possible.
&amp;W*&amp;n checking for injuries: visual inspection for wounds or
irregularities in the skin, then gentle feeling of visual
irregularities or places where the injured complain of
discomfort.
&amp;W*&amp;n makeshift bandaging wounds: if wounds are bleeding too
much to wait for a medic, rip strips of cloth from whatever you

  <ghelp keyword="Cavalry_Basics_Syllabus">
    <entry>&amp;yCAVALRY BASICS SYLLABUS&amp;n

&amp;y-&amp;n basic horse care: Correct saddling of horse, grooming (how,
  how often), feeding (correct feed).
&amp;y-&amp;n mounting: calm horse first (pat nose, let it get used to you),
  left foot in stirrup, hands on saddle-pommel, single fluid
  motion of kick up and swing left over before gently lowering
  yourself into the saddle.
&amp;y-&amp;n dismounting: bring horse to a stand-still, calming them, before 
  standing gently on the stirrups with your hands on the saddle-
  pommel, then swinging your leg over and down to the ground 
  in a fluid motion.
&amp;y-&amp;n battle: slash/stab only at opponent&apos;s to the side of your horse, 
  never slash over your horse&apos;s head. 
&amp;W*&amp;n Underhanded swing to the right during a charge. 
&amp;W*&amp;n Not much opportunity for heavy parries, as one hand must be 
  used to guide the horse at first. Those who choose Cavalry  
  will learn to control their animal with their knees, and will learn 
  more advanced fighting techniques.

  <ghelp keyword="Weapons_Guidelines_Syllabus">
    <entry>&amp;yWEAPONS GUIDELINES SYLLABUS&amp;n

1) &amp;RSword&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;n stance: feet shoulder-width apart, left foot slightly forward,
sword held with both hands at waist height and in line with 
right hip.
&amp;y-&amp;n parry: From stance.
&amp;W*&amp;n parry left: blade held vertically, right hand pushing it out just 
past your left shoulder.
&amp;W*&amp;n parry right: blade held vertically, left hand pushing it out just 
past your right shoulder.
&amp;W*&amp;n parry up: hands rise vertically, tilting the blade until it is held
horizontally, then rising the blade just above head&amp;y-&amp;nheight.
&amp;y-&amp;n slash: from parry, moving the correct foot and slashing
diagonally at opponent&apos;s chest.
&amp;y-&amp;n stab: stepping forward with left foot in a direct stab at
opponent&apos;s midsection.

2) &amp;RPike&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;n stance: feet shoulder-width apart, left foot slightly forward,
pike held across body at an angle, left hand under, right hand 
over.
&amp;y-&amp;n parry: right hand to steady the pike/add power, left hand to
guide it, swinging it left or right.
&amp;y-&amp;n slash: not very effective (blunt weapon). Excercises in
swinging the weapon like a staff.
&amp;y-&amp;n stab: Step forward with left foot, stabbing to opponent&apos;s
midsection as thought with a spear.
&amp;y-&amp;n charge defense: ground butt of pike, lean back, hold point up 
at an angle and into oncoming charge.

3) &amp;RCrossbow&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;n loading: The bowstring, held in a notch by a catch or
trigger, is pulled back by a lever, which in the smaller bows
was worked by hand or foot. The missile to be shot (bolt or
quarrel) then laid in the groove on the top of the stock.
&amp;y-&amp;n holding: left hand at front for aiming, right hand held with 
thumb on latch. Never point at someone you don&apos;t intend to
hurt, point to ground when not firing.
&amp;y-&amp;n firing: target practice. Aim carefully along barrel, release latch
only when you are confident your aim is correct.
&amp;y-&amp;n demonstration of range/power: Instructor picks a far off target
(preferably a tree) and fires at it, demonstrating the range,
then showing how far it penetrates the wood.

4) &amp;RBow&amp;n
&amp;y-&amp;n  precautions: A bracer on your left forearm, and if wanted, finger gloves.  NEVER DRYFIRE, or draw back and release the bowstring without an arrow.  You can ruin the bow and hurt yourself.
&amp;y-&amp;n  loading:  Reach over your shoulder into your quiver, grab an arrow, place its notched end into the bowstring, towards the center.  You should not place it too high or too low, or the arrow may misfire.  
&amp;y-&amp;n  drawing:  Grasp the string with the notch of the arrow between your index and middle finger, and your ring and pinky.  Do not draw back fast, just a steady pull.  Try to bring the bowstring to your ear, with the arrow pointing straight ahead.
&amp;y-&amp;n  aiming:  Sight along the arrow, and try to think of where the arrow will go.  If a target is far away, raise your bow to compensate.  Do not aim too high, or it will fall just as short as it would have been too low.
&amp;y-&amp;n  firing:  once you have aimed, let go of the bowstring.  Try not to flinch, or your arrow may go awry.
&amp;y-&amp;n  demonstration of range/power:  have an instructor fire a bow at a distant target.  Also, explain that the higher the pounds of pull, the farther and the more forceful the arrow.  For example, a bow with a 50 lb.  test will not be as powerful or as ranged as a 100 lb. test.

Band gossip command for posting IC information relating

bandgoss - displays current entries.

  <ghelp keyword="Ranks:">
    <entry>&amp;yRANKS STRUCTURE FOR THE BAND&amp;n

&amp;w-&amp;n Probation
   This is reserved for those who for one reason or another are in poor
   standing within the Band. Members receiving severe disciplinary action
   will be placed in this rank until their punishment is completed, before
   being restored to their previous rank. Whilst on probation, Band 
   members lose all previous rights and responsibilties.
&amp;w-&amp;n Recruit
   This is the entry-level rank for all new guild members. Upon becoming a
   Recruit, you will be handed a tabard bearing the symbol of the Band, so
   that other guild members will be able to easily identify those who may
   need training or guidance.
   Recruits also receive the Band&apos;s Banner, and standard issue boots.
&amp;w-&amp;n First Rank:
   Each of the 6 divisions of the Band has the same number of ranks, and
   many ranks share the same name across divisons. The First Rank of a
   division is where Recruits will be promoted to once they have
   completed their training and chosen their division.

                DIVISION                FIRST RANK
                ========                ==========
                Cavalry                 Horseman
                Swordsmen               Swordsman
                Pikemen                 Pikeman
                Crossbowmen             Crossbowman
                Medics                  Healer

   The Scouts are secretive about their rank structure, even within the
   band. As the Band&apos;s scouts are the best you are likely to find, they
   deserve your respect no matter their rank.

&amp;w-&amp;n Further ranks.
   The further promotional ranks for the divisions are mostly the same,   
   except for a few differences within the Medics. The ranks follow 
   this structure:

                STANDARD RANK           MEDICS
                =============           ======
                Veteren                 Medic
                Bannerman               Chirirgeon
                Fileleader              Field Doctor
                Captain                 Captain

&amp;w-&amp;n Commander
   There is only one Commander of each division.
&amp;w-&amp;n General
   This rank is highest within the guild, and is reserved for Matrim
   Cauthon.

       These are the main ranks you will encounter within the Band of the
Red Hand guild. There are a number of other ranks, but it should not be
difficult to see how these fit in.
There is also a number of subranks for the Band, some of which are:

&amp;w-&amp;n Redarm
   The Redarms are the Band&apos;s internal police, and Redarm duty is
   rotated through every member of the Band. This way, not many will make
   things difficult for the Redarms, since sooner or later, the favour may
   be returned.
&amp;w-&amp;n Instructor
   There will be Intructors within each division who&apos;s job it is to teach
   new First Rankers the way of their chosen profession, as well as 
   providing higher ranked soldeirs with ways of keeping in practice.
&amp;w-&amp;n Master of Recruits
   Essentially the Head Instructor for Recruits, it is their job to keep
   tabs on new recruits and their progress through the lessons.

      Again, you will encounter other subranks, but they should not be
difficult to understand.
