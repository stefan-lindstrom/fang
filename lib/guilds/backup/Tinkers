    <desc>Greetings Friends, allow me to guide you through the information about
the Tuatha&apos;an. First things first, I will show you a little about the
Tuatha&apos;an culture and beliefs. A typical Tinker camp consists of a
number of brightly colored wagons, brightly clothed people, music,
laughter, and song, as if the inhabitants are having a celebration.
The Tinkers themselves strive to have a happy life; occupationally
they are usually singers, dancers, musicians, and especially artisans
and craftsman. The Tinkers are nomadic; their camps never settle in
one place for long, for they must always travel in search of the
Song and to spread peace known as the Way of the Leaf. They travel
in large wagons built to act as homes or crafting shops. The latter
are reinforced and more than twice the weight of a normal wagon,
the Tinkers having found a way to hold larger tools of the craft
such as forges and spits. Crafting is not only with metal, however,
as the Tuatha&apos;an also find themselves tailoring clothing, setting
jewelry, or even mending sails.

The Tuatha&apos;an have a very unique view on life called the Way of the Leaf.
This lifestyle is pacifistic; a Tuatha&apos;an would rather run than fight.
It is believed that violence not only causes harm and injury to the victim,
but also to the attacker, and so a Tuatha&apos;an will run not in fear but to
not hurt his aggressor. Within the camp, visitors are quietly asked to remove
their weapons out of respect to the Way. This lifestyle is strange to most
of the rest of the world in the day and age of strife, yet the Tinkers travel
through it with optimism. Their quiet, happy ways tend to draw many people
away from the villages they past, and for such, the Tuatha&apos;an are often
called Child Stealers and shunned from towns despite the craftwork they
can help do.

The main goal of the Tinkers is not to convert everyone to pacifism, but
to find the long lost Song. It is believed that when the Song is found
peace will simply return to the lands. And so they dedicate their lives
traveling from place to place in search, helping all they can along the way.
For further information about the Guild, read the Requirement board and
speak with as many Tuatha&apos;an as you can. The Mahdi (Guildleader) is also
always happy to answer any questions you may have.

    <reqs>Level requirements
To be guilded into the Tuatha&apos;an you must be atleast level 20.

Who can be a Tuatha&apos;an?

Essentially it is the belief of the Tuatha&apos;an that any who wish to turn to the 
Way of the Leaf should be welcomed wholeheartedly into the guild, however, 
guidelines -have- to be made as to who can join.

A. Male Channelers:
Sorry guys, no Male channelers in the guild. 
Do to the madness of male channelers, they will likely be Lost
to the Tuatha&apos;an in just a matter of time anyhow.

B. Female Channelers:
Will be allowed into the guild only on these restrictions.
1. There will be no IC channeling of any aggressive nature. 
2. There will be no IC Warders, or weapons brought in with you.
3. There will be no unconsented IC weaving upon -anyone- including those
outside of the guild.
4. You cannot be Aes Sedai of the Tower or the Rebels after you become
a Tuatha&apos;an.
5. You will also have to give me a very good explanation as to why you want to be guilded.

C. Ogier:
Ogier will be allowed  in the guild only as a &quot;Visitor.&quot;
D. Wolfkin:
Wolfkin are free to join the Tuatha&apos;an guild
E. Ex-soldiers, and others:
The Tuatha&apos;an guild welcomes you with open arms should you apply,
understand that if you apply for membership that whatever you have
done in the character&apos;s past, remains there.. This meansthat you are 
not going to be bringing your best friend &quot;Bubba&quot; the broadsword in with you.
The Tuatha&apos;an are peace loving people, they don&apos;t fight, they sing, dance,
build things, and spread the Way of the Leaf.. Remember that and you should be fine.

Step 1. Submitting your background
Give the following information:

1. What&apos;s your character name? Give a brief yet insightful history of your
character
2. Why do you wish to join the guild? Give IC and OOC reasons for your character.
3. Explain who the Tuatha&apos;an are, and what they believe.
4. How active do you plan on being in the guild? What do you wish to accomplish?

Step 2. Seeking

Seekers, as you have probably guessed, you will be required to go through
 a seeking process, this means that you will need the authorization and
sponsorship of no less than 2 Guildmembers. I will make this perfectly
clear, the system only works like it should if you do things in the
order that they are planned out. First you submit your background to me,
then I review it, and if discussion is needed, I will talk to you about
your background. After I have reviewed the background I will authorize
you as a seeker, then and only then will you be authorized to gain sponsors.
My reasons are in -your- best interests, if you go out and begins seeking 
immediately upon deciding that you wish to be Tuatha&apos;an and I do not
approve your background, your seeker rp will be null and  you&apos;ll have
to start over, so please, just be patient. Someone will get you authorized.

Step 3. Final approval
This is fairly self explanatory but here goes, at the end of your seeking,
I or another designated person will sit down with you and talk to you about
your application, and touch on the basics of the guild and the way it works.
This will include a general description of the Tuatha&apos;an and the Way of the 
Leaf. I highly suggest that you read the help files on the Tuatha&apos;an ie.
