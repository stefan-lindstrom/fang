    <desc>In caemlyn once came a man called Seldon. This man had been travelling 
around caemlyn for several years, looking for adventure and wealth.
And adventure it was, being in life threathning situations again and again.
But the wealth never came.

But on his travels this man met alot of fellow travellers. Whom all were 
searching for the same as he. These men, while sitting around a campfire,
talked about their adventures and their bad fortune and all came to the 
conclusion that wealth was not ment to be for them. So they decided to 
get a real job. 

While searching for a job they found that there was not a big marked for 
ex-adventurers. So they sat down together once again. They decided to 
start something for themselves. And at that point the Travel Guides of 
Caemlyn were born.

Now, the company has started. Their goal? To guide people no matter where 
they want to go.. No matter what dangerous are on the road there. The goal 
is to get them where they want to go.. and get them there save.
