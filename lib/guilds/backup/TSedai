  <ghelp keyword="novice_syllabus">
    <entry>&amp;cLectures:&amp;n
The student should read the following lectures or have them 
taught to her. It is not really important if the teaching is done as 
roleplay or explained OOCly. The important part is that the 
student absorb the material. 
 
&amp;cLectures: &amp;n
Novice rules --- read &amp;cnovrules&amp;n
Hierarchy --- read &amp;chierarchy&amp;n
History --- read &amp;chistory&amp;n
The Three Oaths --- read &amp;coaths&amp;n
Basic Old Tongue --- read &amp;cotongue&amp;n
 
&amp;cChanneling:&amp;n
The student should read and become familiar with the material 
in the Readings section. If there is any part with which she has 
trouble, she should request to have the lessons taught to her. A 
student should also feel free to ask a higher ranking member for 
clarification on anything she does not understand. 
 
&amp;cReadings: &amp;n
Embracing and releasing --- read &amp;cgnr&amp;n
Simple weaves --- read &amp;cnovweaves&amp;n
Flow Interaction Theory --- read &amp;ctheory&amp;n
Detecting the ability to channel --- read &amp;ctest&amp;n
 
The student should have the following lessons taught to her. 
Technically, they can be taught by anyone of Accepted rank or 
higher. In practice, a student who is new to the concept of 
channeling roleplay would be better served to be taught the 
lesson by one of the more experienced members of the guild. 
 
&amp;cLessons:&amp;n
&amp;cBasic Weave Improvisation
Advanced Emote Channeling&amp;n
 
&amp;cOOC Test:&amp;n First the student will be tested in an out of character 
interview. She will be required to show competence with 
emoting the weaves covered in the earlier section, as well as 
being required to answer technical questions about them. She 
will also be responsible for either knowing the material in the 
lectures or at least being able to reference it quickly enough to 
answer questions or form emotes based on questions about 
them. Anything covered in the syllabus is fair game for 
questions. If the student does not pass, she will have to wait 
one real life week before she may request to be tested again. 
During this time, she is free to request that any of the earlier 
lessons be retaught to her. 
 
&amp;cIC White Tower Test:&amp;n If the student passes the OOC test, she 
will be required to roleplay her trip through the testing 
ter&apos;angreal. 
 
If the student fails the roleplayed test, she will be sent out of the 
Tower, as per the series. Considering the negotiated roleplay 
situation of the test, it is unlikely that someone will make it to the 
test and fail unintentionally. If she passes, which is the most 
likely result, she will be raised to Accepted with all the 
appropriate changes in guild equipment. Codewise, she will 
have her grasp and release skills set to 100, gain the test gskill 
at 100 and the stormshield gskill at 80.

&amp;cNovice Rules, Behavior and Etiquette&amp;n
 
Novices should curtsey to all Aes Sedai and Accepted, and be 
respectful at all times. This includes never interrupting when an 
Aes Sedai or Accepted is speaking, never turning away if they 
are being spoken to, and answering all questions straight away 
and truthfully. They can leave only when dismissed. 
 
Novices should use common sense and discretion when 
dealing with males of any rank. Chatting about the weather in a 
public place is perfectly acceptable. Canoodling in a private 
corner of the garden is not. 
 
A novice must never grasp Saidar without permission or 
supervision by an Aes Sedai or Accepted. 
 
Novices must never leave the Tower grounds without 
permission. 
 
There are other things that a novice will learn through time 
about both her attitude and behaviour. Before being raised to 
Accepted novices should know about composure, for example 
not looking at the ground constantly, acting with a little grace 
and decorum, having good table manners and neatness of 
appearance.

    <entry>&amp;cWhite Tower Hierarchy&amp;n
&amp;cThe Amyrlin Seat&amp;n
The woman chosen to lead the White Tower is the Amyrlin 
Seat. She is not always the strongest Aes Sedai. The politics of 
the Hall of the Tower can play a very large role in determining 
who becomes Amyrlin. She is also known by the titles Watcher 
of the Seals(although they aren&apos;t currently in the Tower) and 
Keeper of the Flame. She is at least the equal of kings and 
queens. Any ruler would come to Tar Valon if requested by the 
Amyrlin Seat. The Amyrlin Seat herself is a member of all the 
Ajahs, while at the same time a member of none. She is to 
represent all their interests, holding no Ajah above any other. 
The Amrylin should be addressed as &quot;Mother&quot;. The current 
Amyrlin of the White Tower is Elaida a&apos;Roihan, raised from the 
Red Ajah. The current Amyrlin in Salidar is Egwene al&apos;Vere, 
raised from no Ajah. She was raised to Amyrlin while an 
Accepted. 
&amp;cThe Keeper of the Chronicles&amp;n
The Keeper of the Chronicles is second in power to only the 
Amyrlin. The Keeper serves as the Amyrlin&apos;s secretary, and 
speaks only for the Amyrlin Seat. Traditionally the Keeper 
comes from the same Ajah as the Amyrlin Seat but currently this 
isn&apos;t true. The Keeper in the White Tower is Alviarin Freidhen of 
the White Ajah.
&amp;c(Ajah Heads)&amp;n
The Head of an Ajah is a secret known only to those Aes Sedai 
within that Ajah. As leader of the Ajah, she technically outranks 
the other members. However, in public she would normally 
follow the same seniority rules as other Sisters in order to help 
conceal her identity from those outside the Ajah. Often, the 
Head will be a Sitter, but this is not always the case. 
&amp;cSitters&amp;n
Sitters are those Aes Sedai who sit in the Hall of the Tower and 
cast their votes in debates and issues facing the White Tower. 
There are usually 3 Sitters from each Ajah. A Sitter is normally 
deferred to by other Sisters. 
&amp;cMistress of Novices&amp;n
The Mistress of Novices is the Aes Sedai in charge of all 
aspects of Novice and Accepted life - their rota of chores and 
lessons, their rooms, and any punishments that need given. She 
keeps track of their behavior and progression through their 
lessons. The current Mistress of Novices in the White Tower is 
Jaiana Di&apos;ovranni-Alai Aneiya Riordan, of the Yellow Ajah.
&amp;cAes Sedai&amp;n
Aes Sedai are those women who have been raised to the shawl. 
They wear a shawl embroidered with the flame of Tar Valon, 
fringed in the color that represents their chosen Ajah, and the 
Great Serpent ring on the finger of their choice. They should be 
addressed as &quot;Aes Sedai&quot; by Novices, and &quot; Sedai&quot; by 
Accepted. Seniority is determined amongst the Sedai by a 
number of factors, such as strength in the One Power, how long 
the Sister was a Novice and how long she was an Accepted. 
&amp;cAccepted&amp;n
Accepted are those who have passed the testing in the ring 
Ter&apos;angreal, and are a step closer to becoming Aes Sedai. They 
wear simple dresses of white banded in the seven colors of the 
Ajahs, and the Great Serpent ring on the third finger of their left 
hand. Their time is spent more in study, and they have more 
control over their own studies and movements than do Novices. 
NOTE: Accepted of the White Tower no longer have a blue 
stripe on their dresses, as all symbols of the Blue Ajah have 
been eliminated from the Tower. Rebel Accepted do not pass 
through the testing ter&apos;angreal, as the rebels do not have access 
to it.
&amp;cNovices&amp;n
Novices are those who wish to train to become Aes Sedai. They 
wear simple dresses of white and are aren&apos;t allowed to wear 
jewellery of any kind or have weapons. They spend almost 
every hour of the day working, either doing chores -washing 
clothes in the laundry, scrubbing pots/preparing meals in the 
kitchen, sweeping the garden paths- or in lessons/studying.
