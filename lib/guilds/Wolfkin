    <desc>Some think that it is a gift from the Creator, others believe it to be a
curse of the Dark One, yet for those with the ability to speak to the
wolves, they know beyond all doubt that it is nothing of the Shadow, for
the wolves that speak only in their minds voice an intense hatred of
anything Dark and those that serve it.
Those that hear the wolves call themselves the Wolfkin (adapted from the;book Wolfbrother - as women also hear wolves on the mud), and they come
from all walks of life, from simple soldiers of the borderlands, to
minor nobles of the southern countries. Only those who spend enough time
out of doors, away from the cities and bustle of civilization, will ever
develop the true rapport between themselves and the wolves. Those who are
born with the ability to hear the wolves but never leave their comforts
never gain their true calling with the wolves, possibly living their entire
lives without realizing what it is they missed. Only those that leave the
cities are approached by the wolves, whether they wish the contact or not.
Once contact has been made, there is no going back. Slowly, their eyes
will change to the same golden color as the wolves' eyes, their mannerisms
becoming more animalistic and their cravings turning towards blood and raw
meat. Their outbursts of temper tend to be more severe and their ability
in battle escalates to match the animalistic verocity of a fighting wolf.
All wolfkin run the danger of losing themselves to the urges of the
wolf, their minds turned completely from their humanity to the point
that, while they still are human in shape, they think, act, and are a
wolf in every other way possible. Once this condition is reached, there
is no cure and death is only a matter of weeks or days away, as no human
can survive as a wolf does for any long period of time. Known as the
&quot;Lost&quot;, these wolfkin are usually avoided by those wolves and wolfkin
that not know them before they lost their mind.
Wolfkin are typically loners, avoiding large cities and crowds,
preferring to camp in the forests rather than stay at an inn or in a
city. Some wolfkin even avoid other wolfkin, keeping to themselves and
the wolves alone, shunning all contact with any humans at all. Others
avoid the wolves in the same manner, trying to ignore the whisperings
that enter their minds and the strange urges of the wolves that may
take them to places within themselves that they did not want to find. A
few, and a small few at that, have learned how to balance the human and
wolf sides of their nature, earning the respect of the wolves. Guided by
the wolves to find those kin that are new to the callings, these wolfkin
strive to assist these new &quot;cubs&quot; through their first few months, helping
them to cope with the new world they have found themselves thrust into.
One cannot seek out the wolves and their kin, any attempt to do so will
end in failure. Instead, one must wait to be sought after to achieve
the best results. Those who prove themselves worthy will find themselves
among a pack of new friends.

    <entry>Wolfkin is limited to a maximum of 35 players, of which only five
of those can be bonded to Aes Sedai and three can be bonded to 
Asha'man. (This does not include the book characters of Elyas
and Perrin.) To ensure that the wolfkin fall under these
restrictions, they will be regularly reviewed for inactivity so
that more active players can play wolfkin. Any single players is
allowed at the maximum, two wolfkin characters, including bookies.

There are also 5 positions open for wolf characters. These
positions are restricted to non-immortal players, since Immortals
can disguise as wolves as necessary. Wolves can no be be found
in cities and will avoid human habitation as best as possible.

Because of the restrictions on this guild, anyone who has not been on
for 30 days, and has not notified the guildleader about their absence
will be deguilded. All wolfkin who intend to be bonded, need prior
approval from the Wolfkin and appropriate Tower (Black, Rebel or 
White) guildleaders, or face the consequence of having the
bonding RP nulled.

This is how Wolves initially see those of the Wolfkin.
This is the default setting any new wolfkin gets. 
It should be noted that Wolfkin of a higher standing
expect respect from those of a lower standing. 
     
For the ranks below, these are the experiences you should 
have before achieving the rank. These are not formal 
lessons, but expected life experiences. Wolfkin can share 
these experiences between each other or help guild younger
members of the pack through these experiences. You rise
in ranks as you have completed the following experiences
as noted and as RP dictates.
     
&amp;BBefriended&amp;n
 1.  Coming to terms with the wolves, accepting them.
 2.  Change in the color of eyes (happens within a day of
     meeting your first wolf ICly).
 3.  Ability to communicate with wolves ICly in a limited
     manner.
 4.  Incidental dreaming with no control.
 5.  Discover wolf name ICly.
    
&amp;cWolf Brother/Wolf Sister&amp;n
 1.  The hatred for shadowspawn.
 2.  Senses start intensfying.
 3.  Knowing that in dreams you can really get hurt.
 4.  Can control dreams.
    
&amp;CRespected&amp;n
This rank is achieved only through extensive RP means and is
given out by the Guildleader as they determine is fitting.

  <ghelp keyword="WolfTalk-WT">
    <entry>The following is to give a guideline on how to use the WT channel
for IC purposes.

WT should be used ICly mainly for the images that wolves would send
to communicate with other wolves or your wolfkin character. If you
are in a city, there would be no wolves about to relay your message.
To make this functional, you can all consider that in areas where
wolves would be able to &quot;hear&quot; you, that you can send something
across WT of an image that a wolf might send across to his or her
pack and any Wolfkin nearby.

For RP where wolves can not be used to relay images. There are several
options that can be used effectively to promote more of this type
of RP. Private channels (see phelp) can be opened and used for this 
purpose as well as being grouped, or using tells. You can even add
into your emote's the scents that you might be giving off that indicate
emotion.

In addition, all OOC comments on WT should be prefaced with some sort
of OOC flag, which has been the custom here for years.

If you have concerns about how to use WT effectively, please speak
with a Guildleader.

These are those that have betrayed the wolves and the other wolfkin 
beyond the point of forgiveness.  The wolves actively search for these 
people to kill them and no wolf will come to their aid if called.
   
&amp;rShunned&amp;n
These are those that the wolves avoid, unless forced into contact with 
them. Often, they have done something to arourse the anger of the wolves, 
but are still in a position to make things right again.  The wolves wil 
not actively search for these people, but very few will come to their 
aid if called.
    
&amp;YLost&amp;n
These are those wolfkin that are completely lost to their wolvish nature. 
This rank can be temporary, but more than often it is not. Once a person has 
been Lost too long, there is no turning back, no cure, and nothing that 
can be Healed.
   
&amp;ba cub/Awakened&amp;n
These are those that are new to the wolves and what their presence means. 
More often than not, they know very little about what is happening to 
them Icly and will need to be guided carefully, lest they end up lost.
The wolves look after these wolfkin, helping them along much as they 
would a cub only a few weeks old, trying to explain to them what they can 
without the help of human speech and protecting them as fiercly as they 
would their own cubs. 
    
&amp;BBefriended&amp;n
These are the standard members of the wolfkin, knowing enough to keep 
themselves from succumbing to the wolf-induced insanity as well as how 
to assist those new to the influences of the wolves. The wolves treat 
these wolfkin as they would any full member of their pack, protecting 
them as they needed it, but also expecting them to be able to protect 
themselves.
   
&amp;cWolf Brother/Wolf Sister&amp;n
These wolfkin are viewed somewhat higher than a standard pack member 
among the wolves.  They are the skill hunters, trackers, cub watchers, 
and protectors that have proven themselves to the wolves and proven their 
dedication to protecting their kin and kind. The wolves treat these 
wolfkin with the deference they would to any long-time member of their 
pack, one whose advice is to be listened to closely, but not neccesarily 
obeyed.
   
&amp;CRespected&amp;n
This is the highest rank acheiveable, short of a minor miricle worked on 
the part of the wolfkin.  These wolfkin are respected much the same as an 
alpha or elder member of the pack would be.  Anything, within reason, 
requested of the wolves by one of these would be carried out.
     
&amp;WHonored&amp;n
Is reserved for Bookies and Immortals.

  <ghelp keyword="Shadowsense">
    <entry>All WK can &quot;smell&quot; shadowspawn,(i.e. fades, trollocs, greymen, gholam, 
etc.) They may or may not be able to smell the Forsaken, depending on 
what said Forsaken was doing shortly before running into the WK (i.e 
having the stench of shadowspawn upon them due to recent contact). 
Wolfkin cannot scent mere darkfriends unless they are horribly twisted 
and tainted a la Padan Fain.

  <ghelp keyword="Channelers">
    <entry>Wolfkin alone cannot sense channelers. The wolves can see the difference
between channelers and non-channelers &quot;as easy as telling a white horse
from a black one&quot; (almost direct quote from the book on this topic). Any
WK in the forest (i.e. with wolves around) could easily find out of the
person they were with was a channeler by simply asking the wolves. No 
Wolfkin alone in the middle of town could be able to tell.

  <ghelp keyword="Wolves">
    <entry>Wolves can speak to each other only about a mile.
   
It is the custom among wolves to give one's name/image and 
smell upon first meeting, wolves are formal when they first 
meet each other.
  
That wolves can walk the dream even when they die.
  
Wolves use only the seasons and different, no notion of          
hours and minutes, and don't understand human thoughts
related to that.

  <ghelp keyword="Senses">
    <entry>A lot of the time you can tell someone's emotional state by their scent.
This works on most people, not just wolfkin. Do not be afraid to use tells
or whatnot to -ask- for such information. There are things that can
interfere, of course. The void makes a person's emotions unreadable at
times and nutcases like Corlan and Rand give off confusing readings at
times. It is not perfect, but it is a good, legitimate way to get a feel
for the emotional atmosphere in a room. Oh, crowding with tend to 
obscure your readings, too. It is hard to pick out one person's 
emotions in a large ballroom full of people, etc..
