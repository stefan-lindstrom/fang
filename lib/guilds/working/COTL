    <desc>The Children of the Light, CotL for short, are a strict order, whose vows are
for life.  These men and women follow their interpretation of the Light, as
written by Lothair Mantelar in his book, &quot;The Way of the Light&quot;.  Some people
think find the Children to be too fanatical, too strict, and too overbearing
with their views while in fact, the Children simply believed that they follow
the True Light.  All others, if not out and out darkfriends, are not as pure
and as &quot;Illuminated&quot; as they are.  Whereas some CotL are the fanatical,
overbearing, vicious types, there are some that believe truly in the calling
that turned them to the CotL, and while they still can be ruthless about their
beliefs, they take a while longer to turn to the violent methods.  The Children
of the Light can be subdivided into two catagories: the Army and the Hand of
the Light.  Basically, the Army are the soldier, fighting types.  The CotL have
a strict chain of command, and orders are expected to be carried out
immediately.  If there is some delay, the Child will be immedietly suspected of
&quot;straying from the Light.  &quot;, which is the worse thing which could ever happen
to a Child.  Children refer to other CotL, who are ranked under them by his or
her rank and last name while Higher ranks are referred to usually by &quot;sir or
madamae&quot; or by their ranks.  A strict militaristic group, the Army makes up the
majority of the members and is typically referred to as the &quot;brute force&quot; of
the Children of the Light.  The Hand of the Light as it is officially know is
typically called the &quot;inquisitors.  &quot; The inquisitors which make up the Hand of
the Light were all members of the Army when he or she began but chose to become
related with the aspects of enforcing the &quot;true light.  &quot; The Hand of the
Light, (HotL), are the ones that have made the Children a feared presence.  
They &quot;question&quot; suspected Darkfriends using a multitude of instruments of
torture to bring the suspected Darkfriend to the Light, &quot;knowing&quot; the answer
before the Question is given.  It is believe by the Hand of the Light that all
Dark Friends must be &quot;cleansed&quot; of their sins by any means necessary, including
being sent to the creator.  Most, if not all of them, think that they are doing
the True Work of the Light, and are therefore superior to the Army of the
Children.  The Army does not answer to the Hand of the Light except for the
High Inquisitor and the Hand of the Light does not answer to the Army except
for the Lord Captain Inquisitor.

    <gossip>There are is some conflicting information on the location
of the main body of the Children of Light outside of Amadicia.
Eamon Valda is said to have brought a large portion of his
military back to the Fortress of Light. Other Lord Captains
are said to have hold in Andor, Far Madding, Altara, 
Tarabon, and the areas between Two Rivers and the Almoth
Plain. There is no given truth on any of these locations
to many Children, and rumor is all they have. There is
hint, though, that the Children still lay a noose on 
Tar Valon lead a Senior Lieutenant of Valda&apos;s and
a movement of calvary is approaching Salidar, with
members of the Hand of Light riding aside. There are
no certain rumors coming from the north and west of 
Amadicia, and the talk that is muttered in camps is
quickly silenced by commanding officers.

&amp;wThe death of Pedron Niall&amp;n

The rumors trace the camps of the death of the Lord
Captain Commander. The story goes that Eamon Valda
walked in on a figure of Abdel Omerna killing the 
Lord Captain Commander. Eamon Valda quickly killed 
Omerna on the spot for treason. The office of 
Lord Captain Commander is to be left open until
the Council of the Anointed have completely 
researched the matter of treason and death- yet
Eamon Valda is said to be the choice for the office
by the Council. Rumor has it that Valda is the acting 
Lord Captain Commander, yet he has denied the office
to finish other tasks at hand first. What could be
more important than leading the Children at their 
time of need?

&amp;wNew policy in Andor&amp;n

There is said to be a new policy in Andor. Groups of
Children, around five to ten in number, are said to
be taking up room and board in houses through out
the land in order to set up protection for the people.
Orders of the groups have been said to range from 
influencing the children of the families by teaching
the ways of the Light- to setting up areas of the
towns and cities as hotspots for control by the 
Children. All Children that are moved into such 
places of boarding are rotated weekly, and disciplined
harshly if rumored to conduct their self badly.
The effects of this policy are yet to be seen, and 
some Children are said to question the motives of
such a new policy in regards to arm discipline and
other natures.


&amp;wIncreased patrols along the river Eldar&amp;n

There is rumor that orders have been passed down from
the Council of Anointed to increase patrols along the
Eldar River, near and around Salidar- a haven for 
darkfriends just a mile outside of Amadicia&apos;s  border.
There is tell that orders are to detain any darkfriend 
that approaches more than a half mile to the Amadicia 
border, and kill any resistance to the order. If 
the witches that are said to be in Salidar are in fact
harbored by the Altaran Queen Tylin Quintara, then
a state of war is in the air between Altara and 
Amadicia. In a side note, all communications from
the detained darkfriends are to be captured and sent
directly to the Fortress of Light.

  <ghelp keyword="Lower_Ranks_Descriptions">
    <entry>The following ranks are the beginning ranks for a newly enlisted
Child of the Light.  Although these all are the basic foot soldiers
for the Children of the Light, each advance in rank brings respect
as well as more responsibility.

&amp;yRecruits&amp;n and &amp;ySoldiers&amp;n
     The first rank in the Children is the rank of &amp;yrecruit&amp;n.
     Thier only duty is to mindlessly obey the orders of their
     superiors and to become physically conditioned to the
     lifestyle of the Children.  All men and women begin at
     this rank, reguardless of which branch he or she wishes
     to join later on.

     The second rank in the Children is the rank of &amp;ySoldier&amp;n
     and is only slightly more respectable than &amp;yRecruit&amp;n.
     Having been physically and mentally conditioned to do as
     told without question, most &amp;ySoldiers&amp;n are used as bait
     in diversionary plans because they are thought to be
     &quot;expendable.&quot;  For every one &amp;ySoldier&amp;n who dies, five more
     &amp;yRecruits&amp;n have advanced rank thus the &amp;ySoldier&apos;s&amp;n life
     is not often cared greatly for.

&amp;YFile Leader&amp;n
     The third rank in the Children is the rank of &amp;YFile Leader&amp;n.
     Achieving this rank allows the member to obtain a small
     amount of resposibility by being in charge of a group of
     3 - 5 &amp;yRecruits&amp;n and/or &amp;ySoldiers&amp;n in which to practice
     leadership and discipline skills upon in preparation for
     eventually becoming a &amp;YSquadman&amp;n.  The life of a &amp;YFile
     Leader&amp;n is just as strenuous as the lives of the &amp;yRecruits&amp;n
     and &amp;ySoldiers&amp;n yet more studying is required than hard,
     physical labor.

&amp;YSecond Squadman&amp;n
     The fourth rank in the Children is the rank of &amp;YSecond
     Squadman&amp;n.  This is the first truly respectible rank for
     a member of the Children because it means that the
     member is truly set within the Light and will do what it
     takes to serve the Light.  The &amp;YSecond Squadman&amp;n
     serves the &amp;YFirst Squadman&amp;n directly as well as
     handles the small matters within the squad that are too
     minute for the &amp;YFirst Squadman&amp;n to handle.  He or she
     is in charge of disciplining the &amp;YFile Leaders&amp;n within
     their squad when necessary as well as doing the performance
     reviews of each &amp;YFile Leaders&amp;n group within the squad.

&amp;YFirst &amp;YSquadman&amp;n
     The fifth rank in the Children is the rank of &amp;YFirst
     Squadman&amp;n.  This rank acts as the right-hand
     person to the rank of &amp;YSquadman&amp;n and with it
     comes more responsibility as expected.  Those
     holding the rank of &amp;YFirst Squadman&amp;n are in
     charge of the &amp;YSecond Squadmen&amp;n in the
     group as well as assisting he or she&apos;s direct
     &amp;YSquadman&amp;n.  Much honor comes with this
     rank due to the fact that those holding it are also
     recognized for the first time by the &amp;YBannerman&amp;n
     which govers the squad.

&amp;YSquadman&amp;n
     The sixth rank in the Children is the rank of &amp;YSquadman&amp;n.
     This rank is the most important rank when speaking of the
     smaller groups in which the Army sector of the Children is
     broken up in to.  Those holding the rank of &amp;YSquadman&amp;n
     are in charge of overseeing and/or training -all- those below
     him or her when necessary as well as reporting directly to
     the &amp;YBannerman&amp;n who is his or her superior.  Those
     holding this rank will also be one of the first to lead a troop
     in to a small, obviously winnable battle when necessary.

  <ghelp keyword="Supply_Guild_Skill">
    <entry>This guild skill can be used to cure the hunger and thirst flags on a
player which occur periodically through time.  The command can be used
an infinite number of times and can be used almost everywhere in the
game.  The percentage of successes increases as the percentage for the
skill increases.  This skill is also handy because it does not require
a player to hold food/liquid within inventory to be used with the skill.

COMMAND:
type &quot;supply&quot;

  <ghelp keyword="Reinforce_Guild_Skill">
    <entry>This guild skill allows a player to summon up to three 30/level CotL mobs.  
These mobs are of equal strength to the player and can be used to assist with
OOC leveling or IC rp by grouping with the player.  The number of mobs summoned
is dependent upon the skill percentage of the player and the mobs will only
assist for a certain period of time before leaving the player.    

COMMAND:
type &quot;reinforce&quot;
</entry>
  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="Morale_Guild_Skill">
    <entry>This guild skill allows a player to increase the &quot;morale&quot; of his or herself and
any CotL mobs which may grouped by adding 3 to hit/dam and adding 3 to
xattacks.  The percentage of success for this guild skill increases as the
percentage of the skill itself increases.    

COMMAND:
type &quot;morale&quot;

  <ghelp keyword="How_to_RP_CotL_Mobs">
    <entry>When CotL mobs are summoned using the Reinforce command, they are then
susceptible to being emoted and used for rp purposes by the player who called
upon them.  In order for a player to emote the mobs as PC&apos;s, two options exist:

     Option 1:  Emoting A CotL to Perform Socials
          type &quot;order whitecloak wiggle&quot;
          outcome from the first CotL mob in the room &quot;A whitecloak wiggles its bottom.&quot;

     Option 2:  Emoting A CotL by Using the &quot;emote&quot; Command
          type &quot;order whitecloak emote blahs at you.&quot;
          outcome from the first CotL mob in the room &quot;A whitecloak blahs at you.&quot;

PLEASE NOTE:
When rping CotL mobs, the mobs must be rped in a manner which would be appropriate 
to the ranks the mobs should be holding.  If the player is ranked as a CotL Recruit, the 
CotL mobs should be rped as Soldiers who are slightly superior to the player.  If the 
player is ranked as a CotL Soldier, the CotL mobs should be rped as Soldiers of equal 
status.  If the player is ranked as a CotL rank higher than Soldier, the CotL mobs should 
be rped as Soldiers who are inferior to the player.
