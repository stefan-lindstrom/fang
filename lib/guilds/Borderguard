    <desc>No description yet.  The guardians against the Blight, the Borderguard is
in fact made of the four northernmost countries in the land : Saldaea,
Kandor, Arafel and Shienar.  Unlike the southern nations, the constant
struggle against the Blight has forced them to cooperate in a cofortable
manner if they are to successfully carry out the task they have been bound
to for thousands of years.  Indeed, many nations stood where they now do
(such as the doomed Malkier, Elsalam, Rhamdashar and many others),
fighting against the looming Shadow.  Many of these nations have been
broken, with their people dying and lands disapearing.  But the
bordlanders have come to accept death as a part of their life, and
continue to fight, forgetting all other troubles to beat the odds and
prevent this fate from coming to the rest of the world.

  <ghelp keyword="Saidin">
    <entry>If you are an active male channeler or a wilder, you should be wary when
joining the ranks of the Borderguard. While recent events involving the
Dragon Reborn have boosted the tolerence of men channeling somewhat, the
practice is still generally abhored by the general populace, including
the borderland armies. If you choose to RP such a thing, be aware of the
repercussions. If the knoledge becomes public that you are a wielder of
Saidin, you may find many obstacles besseting you. Such men, will be
persuaded by friends to head south and join the Asha'man, while those
who dislike you may seek to turn you over to Aes Sedai. In fact, with the
fear that these men inspire when found, it is not unkown for &quot;accidents&quot;
to befall them, to the relief of both good and bad natured people alike.
So it is suggested you keep all your channeling discreet as possible
if you do decide to do this, otherwise is to risk great danger.

  <ghelp keyword="Ranks">
    <entry>A look at the current Borderland ranks in brief.

&amp;R-Marshal General-&amp;n
The high commander currently in charge of overseeing the defenses of all the
borderland nations. 
This position is currently occupied by Tzalenth Jatar.
&amp;R-Lance Captain-&amp;n 
A highly professional soldier, the Lance Captain is second only to the Marshal
General. A Lance Captain has the capability of training recruits as well as 
leading large forces into battle.
This position is held by Chase Sebbinin of Kandor.
&amp;R-Lieutenant-&amp;n
The most common officer seen in the ranks, the lieutenants serve in much the
same capacity as a lance captain, but not on such a large scale, nor with as much
authority. These men usually lead small units of men, as detachments of a larger
army.
&amp;R-Bannerman-&amp;n
Generally those entrusted to both giving and carrying out orders, as well as
bearing the battle standards for organizing an army. The bannermen are the 
bravest of souls, as, like in the books, they are toting around the big flag in the 
middle of a heated and pitched battle, to rally soldiers even when the odds are 
dire. While not officers, the respect they have earned as armsmen in the time 
they have served has lead to them being viewed as authority figures in their 
own right.
&amp;R-Armsman-&amp;n
The common, every day soldier. An armsman is an experienced warrior, often
having served as mercenaries, guards, retainers or even levies before joining
the main ranks of the borderland armies.
&amp;R-Scout-&amp;n
Not always the best of fighters, the scouts are quite adept at other skills that have
earned them much honor. There is much honor in being chosen as a scout, but is a
mixed blessing: while the command depends on you, and gives large rewards for
honosty and loyal service, the enemy is always on the lookout for you, and quick
to take action if they do find you.
&amp;R-Recruit-&amp;n
Those just conscripted or entering the pay of the army. Recruits must go the process
of training and proving their worth before rising in the ranks.

--Non Combat Ranks--
&amp;R-Medic-&amp;n
A much needed commodity in the field. Medics are generally healers and wisdoms
who seek to give as much help as they can for the fighting men of the Blightwatch,
often placing themselves at danger to do so.
&amp;R-Cook-&amp;n
Well, an army needs to eat, doesn't it?
&amp;R-Blacksmith-&amp;n
While not all smiths in the army are blacksmiths (employing also weaponsmiths
and others), this group is generally made up those who are keeping the equipemt
of a soldier battle ready.

  <ghelp keyword="Nation_Militaries">
    <entry>Here are some short and basic descriptions of the different borderland militaries.
These should help you in forming a description, as well as fill in some RP elements.

&amp;r-Saldaea-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Maradon
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n Three silver fish on a field of dark blue
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Three Silver Fish, The Silver Fish
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n Queen Tenobia Si Bashere Kazadi
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n (typical light cavalry)Usually unarmored. Baggy breeches, short coats,
lances, seprentine blades.

A stubborn breed, they are also very forward in dealing with people. The great
portion of their strength lies in their expertise in riding horses.

&amp;r-Shienar-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Fal Moran
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n A black swooping hawk  on a field of three blue and two white horizontal stripes
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Black Hawk
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n King Easar Togita
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n (heavy lancers and cavalry) Long lances tipped with 2 feet of steel.
Mounts of heavy lancers are armored. One or two longswords strapped to back.
Some sort of practical melee weapon strapped to waist (i.e. mace, axe, short sword, broadsword). 
Armor consists of a heavy assortment of leather/mail/plate combinations. This is normally
covered with a surcoat bearing the Shienaran Sigil upon it. The hair of the normal 
soldier is kept closely shaved, and the top kept in a topknot.

Shienarans lives rest in thier honor (like the majority of borderlanders), even if they
must die for it. They are intensely respectful and loyal, especially torwards women.

&amp;r-Kandor-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Chachin
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n The Red Horse on a field of pale green
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Red Horse
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n Queen Ethenielle
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n Dressed out usually in red, for the Red Horse. Bodies are covered 
in steel plate (normally only front and back of the torso), the Sigil emblazoned on 
the front. The helmets are occasionally crested with sigil of the personal lord they are 
bound to. Most officers wear steel gauntlets. Most soldiers carry their 
longswords at the hip.

Not only are the Kandori a battle hardened breed, unlike the rest of the
borderlands, they have established a strong economy based on guild systems.
The success of a person is usually judged by the quality of the 
earing they wear, as long as the number of chains across the chest. While the hair 
 is kept short, they grow long beards, usually forked.

&amp;r-Arafel-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Shol Arbela
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n Three white roses on a field of red quartered with three red roses on a field of white
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Roses
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n King Paitar Nachiman
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n The type of armor they wear can vary. The Arafellen are skilled swordsmen, 
often wearing two swords, the hilts protruding from both shoulders.

As strong as the rest of the borderlanders, and just as bound to honor. Both
men and women will put their hair into two braids, silver bells on the end of them.

  <ghelp keyword="saidar">
    <entry>While it is not common, women who can channel can be found helping defend
the Blightborder.  These women are generally women who have been put put
out of the tower, unable to obtain the shawl, or are channelers who
survived teaching themselves and have elected to remain in their homelands
instead of searching out the Tower.  Once in a great while, even an Aes
Sedai can be found offering their services, though those who do so on an
extended basis have usually been in retirement for a while.

  <ghelp keyword="Darkfriends">
    <entry>Darkfriends are allowed in this guild, yet there are concequences to pay if you are discovered.  If suspected, the Marshal General or Lance Captain will order an investigation and you will temperarily be put under arrest.  If you are found innocent, you will quickly be reinstated to your previous position, with our apologies, but if you are found guilty, you will be publicly executed.  If you suspect someone of darkfriend activities, report it to the Marshal General or the Lance Captain immediatly, but you must have good reason for this, we will not have people reporting people they do not like just to humiliate them publicly.
