    <desc>The guild of Seanchan represents the whole nation. The
descendants of Hawkwing that traveled east over the
ocean. More specifically the guild represents those that
have returned, that are now back and attempting to run 
over the lands, and put the blood of Hawkwing back where
it belongs.

The Seanchan are ruled by an Empress, descending 
directly from Arthur Hawkwing. When the empress dies her
daughter takes over for her. The Empress is never 
titulated in any way but, the Empress, and to be allowed
to look upon the face of the Empress, is the final honor
for one of the Seanchan.
The bodyguards of the Empress are the Deathwatch Guard, 
they are chosen from Covale, property, in very young 
years. They are trained only to defend her and follow 
her orders, they are feared soldiers within the Seanchan
society, and in their dark green armours and ornated 
helmets they are a feared sight on the battlefield as 
well.

The most important thing in the Seanchan world is the 
honor, Seia&apos;taer meaning straight eyes, one who has 
gained honor, and Seia&apos;mosiev meaning, one who has lost 
honor. The ultimate dishonor for one of the Seanchan 
blood is to be denied the right to die by the Empress 
when dishonored and be forced to live with the dishonor.
To say that someone is Seia&apos;mosiev means that they have 
no honor, it is a very serious insult.

The ranks of the guild range from the da&apos;covale, those 
who are property, to common soldiers and their officers 
to the more exotic creatures such as; Grolm, S&apos;redit, 
Raken etc... and of course those that handle the exotic 
creatures, the Morats. Also seen in the guild is the 
Damane, the leashed channelers, handled by the Sul&apos;dams.
The nobles of Seanchan are represented as well, the 
blood, highest being the high Lords and high Ladies, 
under them coming lesser nobles, the only ones that do 
not have to follow the orders of the blood, the ears and
hands of the empress: The feared Seekers and the mighty 
Deathwatch Guard, there to make sure the law of the 
Empress is upheld.

The armours worn by the Seanchan military in battle is
ornated to make the men look like insectoids, this is 
only true for officers, lower ranking men wear plain 
armours, but the officers wear very ornated armours, 
lacquered and painted in bright colors.

    <reqs>The process for joining the Seanchan Guild is as follows:

1. You must be at least level 20 to enter, as is the case with any guild.

2. You must  have  a  well written,  comprehensive character description,
which follows the generally accepted standards of the MUD.

3. You must send the Guildleader a background of your character.  If you
are unfamiliar with Seanchan culture, and the guild&apos;s role in the world,
the Guildleader can help you with this.

4. You must gain two sponsors from the guild.  One of these will ideally
be of the specific rank or division you wish to join. Exceptions to this
can be made, in cases where it is necessary.

5. Please - no male channelers.  They are generally found and killed too
quickly to realisticly have any in the guild.   Once again,   if you can
present a strong enough case, exceptions can be made, however unlikely.

6. Female channelers are welcome in the ranks of sul&apos;dam and damane, but
are discouraged from seeking other position in the Seanchan guild.
</reqs>
    <gossip>Rumors are spreading in the houses about the Ever
Victorious Army not being so victorious in these 
lands. Several small defeats have happened in the 
vicinity of Tarabon, scout troops wiped out and small 
parties decimated. Of course the Seekers for Truth 
are hitting down on anybody found speaking of these 
things, but things are said among the soldiers.

    <entry>COVALE

Covale, or da&apos;Covale, the first meaning property and 
the second meaning those who are property, are what 
slaves are called in Seanchan. If one are born by 
parents already enslaved one is automatically a slave. 
The slaves are taken on raids against other people, 
mostly those much more primitive. In the lands of 
Hawkwing Covale are not being taken, this people is 
not meant to be enslaved, they are meant to be ruled.

  <ghelp keyword="houses">
    <entry>HOUSES

The whole Seanchan society is based on the different 
houses. Everybody in Seanchan belongs to a house, 
going from the High Lord or Lady ruling the house, 
the people working for them, their soldiers and 
finally their Covale. The only ones not belonging to 
a house is the Seekers for Truth and the Deathwatch 
Guard, standing outside the house system belonging 
directly to the Empress.

In Seanchan the houses own different parts of the 
country, often small wars are played out between the 
houses close by each other, and the alliances shifts 
quickly. These small wars are not stopped by the 
Empress, when things escalate she may choose to stop 
them, but the small wars work only to build her power 
even stronger by weakening the houses.

  <ghelp keyword="blood">
    <entry>BLOOD

The nobles of the Seanchan are called blood, they are 
the blood of hawkwing. It is forbidden for everybody 
to draw the blood of hawkwing, not even the Deathwatch 
Guard may harm one of the blood. When one of the blood 
is sentenced to execution they are hanged in a silk 
back outside the Tower of Ravens. There the ravens eat 
them while they are still alive, in that way noone 
draws the blood of hawkwing.

The imperial family is the family of the Empress, 
consisting of her closest kin, those of the blood not 
belonging to the imperial family belongs to one of the 
Seanchan houses (see ghelp 12 houses). Heading a house 
is a High lord or lady, under him/her is other lords and 
ladies of lesser rank.

When one of the blood is present everybody that isn&apos;t 
blood is to lie down with their faces to the floor and 
wait until they are allowed to stand up. No one except 
someone of higher rank is allowed to turn their back 
on one of the blood.

When a high lord or lady enters an area they are 
announced with a gong, at the sound of that gong everybody 
lies down and kisses the ground. Of course the Seekers for 
Truth and the Deathwatch Guard are excepted from these 
rules as they represent the Empress.

When one of the blood have been subject to dishonor the 
easiest way to clear the family from the deep shame is to 
commit suicide. The worst punishment for them in that case 
is to be denied the right to kill themelves by the Empress, 
so both they and their family is forced to live with the 
lost honor.

    <entry>TEST

Test is a skill that most of the damane learns over 
time, it is the ability to feel if another woman have 
the ability to channel the power. When the damane have
learned this skill she might be used by the empire to 
find other channelers. The sul&apos;dam can direct the 
damane to do this as well with the help of the a&apos;dam.  

What the different messages of test actually means, the 
numbers being the difference from your own strength:

&quot;very weak indeed. Perhaps a beginner.&quot; 0-5
&quot;far weaker than you.&quot;                  5-10%
&quot;a good deal weaker than you.&quot;          10%-30%
&quot;weaker than you.&quot;                      30%-45%
&quot;about half as strong as you.&quot;          45%-55%
&quot;a little weaker than you.&quot;             55%-70%
&quot;slightly weaker than you.&quot;             70%-85%
&quot;almost as strong as you.&quot;              85%-95%
&quot;about the same in strength.&quot;           95%-105%
&quot;a tiny bit stronger than you.&quot;         105%-115% 
&quot;slightly stronger than you.&quot;           115%-145%
&quot;a little stronger than you.&quot;           145%-180%
&quot;about twice as strong as you.&quot;         180%-220%
&quot;stronger than you.&quot;                    220%-300%
&quot;a good deal stronger than you.&quot;        300%-1000%

  <ghelp keyword="damane">
    <entry>DAMANE

The damane is an essential part of the Seanchan 
power, most of the damane being under direct control
of the imperial throne. The damane is captured 
channelers, they wear a leash, an a&apos;dam, in the 
other end held by a sul&apos;dam. Through the a&apos;dam the 
sul&apos;dam is controlling the damane, being able to 
transmit pain through the a&apos;dam it is a very 
effective way of controlling. Every year in Seanchan
there is a party travelling around the country, 
testing all girls, if they can channel, if they can 
they are taken away to be trained to damane, and to 
be leashed for the rest of their lives. Other girls 
have the affinity to become sul&apos;dam, these are also 
taken away, trained to hold the leash. Anybody that 
can channel yet not under the leash is marath&apos;damane
for the seanchan, literally meaning, those who must 
be leashed. 

The Damane is clad in very plain gray dresses,
the Sul&apos;dam wears a blue dress inset with red panels
on the breast and the sides of the skirt. The panels
are marked with silver forked lightning.

To own a damane is very rare, most are owned by the 
Empress, a high lady or lord might afford to own a 
couple. It is a high sign of status to own a damane,
and it is also a strong addition to the houses 
military forces.

The Seanchan is offering 1000 gold marks to anybody 
that turns in a marath&apos;damane in the lands of 
Hawkwing. Thus creating another danger for any of 
the Aes Sedai that would be willing to come close to
the Seanchan armies.

breeds are well known for their durability in the 
fields and their light horse are known for their speed
and agility. On top of this, Mirshadin is also well 
known for their breeding programs among the exotics, 
and their horses are uncommonly calm about the 
uncommon beasts, making the all the more valuable and 
more sought after by various levels of command within 
the empire. Mirshadin breeds have been used in many

basically having an own army, and a small part of 
the army being Imperial. The army is strictly 
organized, the soldiers wears the Imperial colors or 
the colors of their house. When it comes to the 
officers they often wear heavily ornated armors,

a short sword and a shield. The army is expertly
trained to fight in large groups, thus excelling over
most armies in the lands of Hawkwing.
