    <desc>&amp;KMen and women who could not channel were also susceptible to promises of power
and immortality.  With the Dark touch fueling baser emotions like greed and
envy, there were many who would give their oaths.  In the beginnin, these
people styled themselves Friends of the Dark.  In modern times they are known
simply as Darkfriends.  Like the Forsaken, they originated with the Dark One&apos;s
touch through the Bore.  Unlike the Forsaken, they have not known immortality,
yet they have survived as a society for over three thousand years, serving and
waiting for Tarmon Gai&apos;don: the last battle.  On a hire to kill basis, the
&quot;Assassins&quot; are kept very descrete, and &quot;hush hush.&quot; With word in society of
this group, many members would be tortured or even worse, killed.  This club
meets at night in places thought to be unfit for anyone.  With a membership
extending to all of the major cities, all members are known with one another,
as to ease on the confusion.  All contracts taken out by the club has to be
passed through a council, consisting of the Leader, and 3 of the council
members.  Any negative response to a contract will result in death to the
person whom asked for the contract.  &amp;n
