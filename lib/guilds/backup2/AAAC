The Alantin&apos;An&apos;Al&apos;Cor is, or was rather, best described as a group of 
partially trained men who owe personal allegiance to the noble who 
gathered and financed them. However, they are different in many ways. 
Unlike many other &quot;noble-armies&quot;, this group of half-soldiers was 
never used to protect the country itself. It was founded and financed 
by Merridrew Forthan. Since they had to defend themself during several 
small battles between countries such as Andor, Cairhien, Tear and 
Illian, and the Aiel war, Alantin&apos;An&apos;Al&apos;Cor grew from a bunch of 
half-diciplined, partially trained warriors, to a well-diciplined, 
highly trained army of top soldiers. They have recruiting stations 
in Caemlyn and other Andoran cities that  lie close to the capital. 
So, what is it that Alantin&apos;An&apos;Al&apos;Cor exist to do? From the beginning 
they were used mainly to protect the noble or lord that financed them, 
but ever since they became more like an army, they have had other purposes. 
As they grew larger, they used the entire army as mercenaries. By 
helping out different houses in battles, riots or other things, they 
gained a good profit, so that they could extend their supplies and 
equipment. Later they grew even more, and extended their ranks into 
various categories, many of which were named after Aiel factions. 
They began concentrate on recruiting, so that they could be an independent 
army, dedicated to crush those unfair and unjust, such as the Whitecloaks. 
They gain money by being merchant guards for hire, and also by having 
an entire part of the group working as merchants. They are now fronted 
by two mysterious individuals, who nary a few have seen.
