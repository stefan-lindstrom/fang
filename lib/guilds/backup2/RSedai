&amp;gDETECTING FEMALE CHANNELERS&amp;n
.
As the student&apos;s ability with the One Power grows, she will gradually 
reach a point where she is able to sense the same ability within other 
women. This ability would not likely show up until the student is fully 
competent with embracing and releasing the One Power. In game terms, a 
student is set with the code skill for this, test, when she is raised 
to Accepted. 
.
It is easier to sense the ability in one who is trained. It is also 
possible to gain a rough idea of the person&apos;s strength in the One Power 
relative to one&apos;s own. For those who are untrained, it is possible to 
get an idea of their potential strength. One can also tell if the young 
girl is teachable or if she has the spark inborn. The books never 
discuss exactly how this is done. They can just tell. 
.
This is not a very long range ability. If a woman is not holding the 
Power, another woman would not be able to sense the ability in her at 
more than five or six feet(approx. two meters) away. If one is not 
paying close attention, it is difficult to tell at more than arm&apos;s 
length. 
.
Use of the One Power can be sensed much further away, depending on how 
much is used. Since women trained in the use of Saidar can see a glow 
around other women who are holding the Power, then she would be able to 
notice another woman in her line of sight channeling as far away as she 
could see her. If line of sight is not possible, the exact range of 
detection is harder to determine. As a rough guide, if someone is 
channeling in a building the size of an inn, and the amount channeled 
is not purposely miniscule, another woman trained in channeling should 
be able to detect it.

  <ghelp keyword="oaths">
    <entry>
&amp;gTHE THREE OATHS&amp;n
.
All Aes Sedai swear the three Oaths on the Oath Rod when they are 
raised to the shawl. As the Oaths are spoken there is said to be a 
feeling of the oaths &quot;settling&quot; into the Sedai and a tightening of the 
skin, along with a mild burning sensation. Rebel Aes Sedai raised since
the split in the Tower do not hold the Rod when they swear, although 
&amp;Wthey do still take the Oaths&amp;n. They should still strive to live by 
them, as should Novices and Accepted. 
.
&amp;WThe Oaths:&amp;n
.
&amp;g1.&amp;n Speak no word that is not true. 
&amp;g2.&amp;n Make no weapon for one man to kill another.
&amp;g3.&amp;n Never use the One Power as a weapon except against Darkfriends 
or Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defending her own life, that 
of her Warder, or that of another Sister. 
.
The most important thing about the Oaths is why they are sworn. Each 
has a specific reason. By swearing to tell only the truth, Aes Sedai 
prove that they can be trusted, that if they make a promise, they will 
keep it. Aes Sedai have the ability to craft or enhance objects with 
the One Power. By swearing the second oath they reassure the rest of 
the nations that they will never be involved in the raising of armies 
or the propagation of war. An army of soldiers whose swords cannot be 
broken and shields would never dent would be at a massive advantage. 
The third oath assures the nations that the Aes Sedai are not an 
agressive power. With the Power that broke the world at their beck and 
call, they would be unstoppable should they decide to expand their 
control. 
.
All women being trained to become Aes Sedai are expected to live as if 
they have already sworn these oaths, regardless of whether or not they 
are in the White Tower. In the White Tower a woman swears before the 
Amyrlin on the day she is raised the the shawl. In Salidar it is much 
the same, although the Oath Rod isn&apos;t present. 
.
On a practical note, one who sworn the Oaths on the Oath Rod is 
completely incapable of breaking them. The Oath Rod binds her to her 
word. However, there are ways to deceive without technically lying. For
example: 
.
&amp;cJane gives the servant a level stare, then introduces calmly, &quot;You 
may address me as Lady Sara. Please tell your lord I wish to speak with 
him as soon as it&apos;s convenient.&quot; &amp;n
.
Note that she did not say that her name is Sara, merely that the 
servant could call her Sara.

  <ghelp keyword="grasp_release">
    <entry>
&amp;gGRASP AND RELEASE&amp;n
.
Grasping and releasing the One Power is something a member of the Aes 
Sedai will do very often. In fact, it will be done so often as to 
become a very trivial part of one&apos;s channeling emotes. 
.
In Robert Jordan&apos;s world, it could take weeks or even months for a girl
to become competent and embracing the One Power, depending on her 
natural aptitude for it and whether or not she had sparked. For most 
people, roleplaying these weeks or months of trying to embrace, but 
failing, is boring to say the least. If someone actually wants to 
roleplay such things, that is her decision. For most, however, this 
will be part of their character&apos;s assumed history. If the play can 
demonstrate a competence with emoting this, it will be assumed that her
character has spent the necessary time and practice. She may request to 
be tested on this whenever she feels ready. If she passes, she will 
have her grasp and release skills set to 70%. 
.
In the books, many different relaxation and visualization techniques 
are described for getting into the proper state of mind to embrace 
Saidar. These can be useful if one is actually RPing the lesson. 
However, they will likley never be used outside this lesson. Since it 
is generally accepted that one should not put thoughts into one&apos;s 
emotes, there is little purpose to these techniques other than to give 
one background information and perhaps aid in the feel of Jordan&apos;s rich 
world. For the sake of brevity, only the rosebud technique will be 
discussed here. 
.
The student should visualize herself as a tightly closed rosebud with 
Saidar as the sun. She should imagine turning towards the sun and 
slowly opening her petals to soak in the sunlight, allowing Saidar to 
flow into her. The important concept in this is the passivity of the 
student. Saidar should never be forced. One has to surrender herself to 
Saidar to control it. Women do not grasp the one power, they embrace 
it. They do not force it to their bidding, they gently guide it while 
allowing it to do their bidding. This is all useful background 
material, but difficult to use in an emote. An emote should only 
include those things which can be sensed by the audience. The Wheel of 
Time world does not have telepathy, so the audience cannot sense that 
the student is imagining herself as a rosebud. Her facial expressions 
and posture can be seen. Any noises she makes can be heard. Other 
female channelers can feel her channel and see a soft golden glow 
around her when she holds the power. The intensity of the glow will 
increase or decrease with the amount of Power she holds. These are 
things that can be included in the emote. An example: 
.
&amp;cJane takes a deep breath. As she slowly releases it, her face takes on 
a serene expression, muscles relaxing and smoothing. For those women 
present who can channel, a soft, golden nimbus surrounds her as she is 
slowly filled with Saidar. &amp;n
.
The previous example is not a bad emote for someone just learning to 
use the One Power. Embracing is still a task which requires time and 
concentration. As the student gains more practice, the Power will come 
more easily. Eventually the student will be able to embrace without 
thought, forming weaves almost instantly after embracing. The act of 
embracing will become a rather trivial part of the channeling emote. An 
example: 
.
&amp;cJane is surrounded by a golden aura, visible to other women who can 
channel, which grows brighter as she draws more deeply upon Saidar. &amp;n

  </ghelp>
  <ghelp keyword="grasp2">
    <entry>
&amp;W(continued from grasp_release)&amp;n

Releasing the One Power is rather simple. One merely lets it go. The 
only difficulty is in wanting to let it go. That will be addressed more 
fully later when dangers of channeling are discussed. An example of 
releasing: 
.
&amp;cThe golden aura around Jane dims and then goes out as she releases 
Saidar with a soft sigh and a slightly wistful expression on her face.&amp;n 
.
Channeling has some inherent dangers. Saidar is addictive. Holding the 
Power fills one with a sense of well-being and ecstasy. There is a 
sweetness to Saidar that causes one to want to draw more and more of 
it. There is a point where the pleasure starts to turn to pain. This is 
the limit of what one can safely hold. Drawing any more runs the risk 
of burning out, losing the ability to channel forever, or dying. This 
same sweetness that causes one to want to draw more deeply on Saidar 
also causes one to not want to part from it. If one does not gradually 
build up a tolerance, she could become addicted, wanting nothing but to
hold Saidar. The extreme stages of this addiction lead to headaches, 
then comas, then death. This danger is one of the reasons that novices 
are not allowed to channel except under direct supervision during 
lessons. 
.
Channeling while fatigued is dangerous, as well. If tired, a channeler 
can lose control of the Power with results from merely losing their 
grasp to burning out and dying. Channeling while tired is further 
complicated by the fact that channeling is in itself a tiring activity, 
a deceptively tiring one. The rush that one feels from holding the 
Power makes it difficult to notice how much it is fatiquing her.

&amp;gHIERARCHY&amp;n
.
&amp;WThe Amyrlin Seat&amp;n
The woman chosen to lead the White Tower is the Amyrlin Seat. She is 
not always the strongest Aes Sedai. The politics of the Hall of the 
Tower can play a very large role in determining who becomes Amyrlin. 
She is also known by the titles Watcher of the Seals(although they 
aren&apos;t currently in the Tower) and Keeper of the Flame. She is at least 
the equal of kings and queens. Any ruler would come to Tar Valon if 
requested by the Amyrlin Seat. The Amyrlin Seat herself is a member of 
all the Ajahs, while at the same time a member of none. She is to 
represent all their interests, holding no Ajah above any other. The 
Amrylin should be addressed as &quot;Mother&quot;. The current Amyrlin of the 
White Tower is Elaida a&apos;Roihan, raised from the Red Ajah. The current 
Amyrlin in Salidar is Egwene al&apos;Vere, raised from no Ajah. She was 
raised to Amyrlin while an Accepted. 
.
.
&amp;WThe Keeper of the Chronicles&amp;n
The Keeper of the Chronicles is second in power to only the Amyrlin. 
The Keeper serves as the Amyrlins secretary, and speaks only for the 
Amyrlin Seat. Traditionally the Keeper comes from the same Ajah as the 
Amyrlin Seat but currently this isn&apos;t true. The Keeper in the White 
Tower is Alviarin Freidhen of the White Ajah. The Keeper in the Rebel 
Tower is ???. 
.
.
&amp;WAjah Heads&amp;n
The Head of an Ajah is a secret known only to those Aes Sedai within 
that Ajah. As leader of the Ajah, she technically outranks the other 
members. However, in public she would normally follow the same 
seniority rules as other Sisters in order to help conceal her identity 
from those outside the Ajah. Often, the Head will be a Sitter, but this 
is not always the case. 
.
.
&amp;WSitters&amp;n
Sitters are those Aes Sedai who sit in the Hall of the Tower and cast 
their votes in debates and issues facing the White Tower. There are 
usually 3 Sitters from each Ajah. A Sitter is normally deferred to by 
other Sisters. 
.
.
&amp;WMistress of Novices&amp;n
The Mistress of Novices is the Aes Sedai in charge of all aspects of 
Novice and Accepted life - their rota of chores and lessons, their 
rooms, and any punishments that need given. She keeps track of their 
behavior and progression through their lessons. The current Mistress of 
Novices in the White Tower is Jaiana Di&apos;ovranni-Alai Aneiya Riordan, of 
the Yellow Ajah. The current Mistress of Novices in the Rebel Tower is 
Lauriana al&apos;Veren, of the Yellow Ajah.

.
&amp;WAes Sedai&amp;n
Aes Sedai are those women who have been raised to the shawl. They wear 
a shawl embroidered with the flame of Tar Valon, fringed in the color 
that represents their chosen Ajah, and the Great Serpent ring on the 
finger of their choice. They should be addressed as &quot;Aes Sedai&quot; by 
Novices, and &quot; Sedai&quot; by Accepted. Seniority is determined amongst the 
Sedai by a number of factors, such as strength in the One Power, how 
long the Sister was a Novice and how long she was an Accepted. 
.
.
&amp;WAccepted&amp;n
Accepted are those who have passed the testing in the ring Ter&apos;angreal, 
and are a step closer to becoming Aes Sedai. They wear simple dresses 
of white banded in the seven colors of the Ajahs, and the Great Serpent 
ring on the third finger of their left hand. Their time is spent more 
in study, and they have more control over their own studies and 
movements than do Novices. (NOTE: Accepted of the White Tower no longer 
have a blue stripe on their dresses, as all symbols of the Blue Ajah 
have been eliminated from the Tower. Rebel Accepted do not pass through 
the testing ter&apos;angreal, as the rebels do not have access to it.) 
.
.
&amp;WNovices&amp;n
Novices are those who wish to train to become Aes Sedai. They wear 
simple dresses of white and are aren&apos;t allowed to wear jewelry of any 
kind or have weapons. They spend almost every hour of the day working, 
either doing chores (washing clothes in the laundry, scrubbing 
pots/preparing meals in the kitchen, sweeping the garden paths) or in 
lessons/studying.

&amp;gHISTORY&amp;n
.
The Age of Legends was a time of miracles, when all things were 
possible and both men and women served as Aes Sedai (&quot;Servant of All&quot; 
in the Old Tongue). During this prosperous age, one of the most 
powerful Aes Sedai was born and came to prominence
 his name was Lews 
Therin Telamon, the Dragon. He was unique beyond being Aes Sedai, for 
he was a Ta&apos;veren. 
.
The easiest method of describing Ta&apos;veren is to say that they are a 
focal point for the pattern. They often have no control over this and 
have even less control over their own actions than those who aren&apos;t 
Ta&apos;veren, and they can often appear to be very lucky in that things 
seem to go their way. It&apos;s not just that they are simply lucky, it&apos;s 
that the pattern forces events such that the Ta&apos;veren ends up where the
pattern needs him. 
.
It is not known how long Lews Therin led the Aes Sedai before 
destruction occurred, but as Aes Sedai led lives more than 500 years 
long it could be any significant amount of time. He ruled and the land 
prospered until a group of slighted Aes Sedai began to uproot some 
secrets that would affect all time - chiefly among these secrets was 
the existence of a power, equal in strength to the Creator, known as 
Shai&apos;tan, or the Great Lord of the Dark. This divinity had been sealed 
in a prison at the moment of creation, destined to lead an existence 
cut off from the world, with no influence or control. 
.
The event that was to begin the conflict between the forces of good and 
evil was the bore, the hole drilled by Lanfear and another Forsaken 
into the prison of the Dark One. This action caused the war to begin 
immediately for although Shai&apos;tan was still constrained in the prison 
his hand could reach out and affect the world. Lews Therin rallied the 
forces of the Light, it&apos;s backbone the Aes Sedai and it&apos;s regular 
troops as newly trained soldiers. No violent crime had been committed 
for a long period of time before the war, thus the need for troops was 
non-existent, putting the Light at a distinct disadvantage at the 
beginning of the war. 
.
The Forsaken began to construct their own army, using powers from the 
Dark One and their own twisted skill, to form creatures of nightmarish 
aspect. Chiefly among these experiments were Trollocs, Myrddraal, 
Draghkar, Darkhounds, and Gray men. (see later lectures). 
.
The war began, the Light with the Aes Sedai and soldiers drawn from the 
land against the Shadow with all it&apos;s twisted evil. The war lasted a 
bloody ten years, desperate battle fought after desperate battle, the 
Light losing almost every confrontation. Slowly the Aes Sedai began to 
understand the full implications of their dilemma, and they began to 
construct objects of the power to aid them in their struggle. Known as 
Angreal, Ter&apos;angreal and Sa&apos;angreal, these objects allowed the wielder 
to draw more of the One Power, greatly increasing the wielder&apos;s 
effectiveness. They can generally be used by either a man or a woman 
but not both. Sa&apos;ngreal are stronger versions of angreal, and are less 
common. Both of these require that the channeler touch them while 
channeling, and they will allow the channeler to draw much more of the 
Source than they could otherwise. Ter&apos;angreal are made for a specific 
purpose, such as putting someone to sleep. There are many more 
ter&apos;angreal than the other two. Some of them can be used by men, some 
by women, some by either, and some do not require an ability to channel 
at all. The use and function of most ter&apos;angreal is unknown, and it can
 be extremely dangerous to experiment with these unknowns. Note - 
*angreals were made before the war, just far far less often, and with 
less intent to do harm.

Unfortunately, not even these new weapons were able to stop the advance 
of the Shadow, and city after city, country after country fell into 
darkness and despair. During the last two years of conflict Lews Therin 
proposed to the rest of the Aes Sedai that they pool their strength, to 
strike one massive blow at the heart of the conflict, the bore at 
Shayol Ghul. This plan managed to split the Hall of Servants into two 
armed camps, the supporters of Lews Therin, mostly consisting of men, 
while the others who argued that they should continue fighting as they 
had done before. 
.
Finally, Lews Therin decided to end The War of Power by his own means, 
without permission from the Hall. His band of Aes Sedai, now called the 
Hundred Companions, as well as a group of 10,000 military men, struck 
at the heart of the Shadow. As it happened all thirteen forsaken were 
at the bore holding a council of some sort. Lews Therin&apos;s attack caught
them completely off-guard and before the forsaken could strike they 
were bound and sealed when Lews Therin and his Hundred Companions 
sealed the Bore on the prison. 
.
The ramifications of Lews Therin&apos;s actions would be immediately felt, 
as all who struck and sealed the Dark One were grabbed and smashed by 
the Dark One&apos;s counter-stroke. Instead of striking at the Aes Sedai 
themselves the Great Lord of the Dark tainted the male half of the True 
Source, effectively placing a curse upon the male Aes Sedai of madness 
and a death from rot. All the male channelers at the sealing went 
instantly insane turning what was a glorious victory into nothing but 
ashes. 
.
The consequences of the counter-stroke affected all male channelers, 
driving some immediately mad while others managed to handle the taint 
for a few years. Before the male Aes Sedai could die they smashed all 
around them, smashing whole cities and destroying miles of land around 
themselves in obliterating blasts of power. Then, what is now called 
the Breaking of the World began, for the very foundations upon which 
the world stood were changed, and this change was sudden, violent, and 
deadly.

&amp;W(continued from ghelp 50 history2)&amp;n

As the world began to break apart the people began to scatter to all 
ends of the planet in vain attempts to find shelter and peace, Lews 
Therin, fully wrapped in madness, returned to his home and began to 
destroy all around him, killing his wife, children, and all his friends
who had been there through the war. Ever after this day he would be 
known as the Kinslayer, the man who broke the world, the Dragon of 
prophecy. The war was over, ten years of bloody, horrific, bitter 
struggle, completed and won for the Light, but the cost was tremendous.
.
The Age of Legends would end in the following years, the glories and 
marvels of countless generations vanishing like a mirage as knowledge 
and technology disappeared - the lands began to shatter and people and 
hope began to die. The Ogier, the gentle giants that were only humanoid 
in shape but long lived unlike humans - allies of the Light throughout 
the war - vanished into their Steddings, peaceful abodes that offered 
protection from the madness and chaos of the outside world. Many male 
Aes Sedai went with the Ogier, the Steddings blocking the ability to 
channel, and these accursed men were able to live awhile without fear 
of a rotting death. 
.
However, these men, who had so recently been the strongest influences 
across worlds soon left the Ogier sanctuaries, unable to resist the 
call of the power and the need to channel it. The Nym, whose bodies 
were made of bark and leaf and who were brothers to the Ogier, slowly 
began to die out, their immortality gone at the end of the war. Only 
one of the Nym would survive the cataclysm, his task to guard a pure 
pool of Saidin known as the Eye of the World. The Aiel, (&quot;dedicated&quot; in 
the Old Tongue) once the servants of the Aes Sedai, pledged to peace, 
fled with the treasures of the Aes Sedai - objects given into Aiel 
trust for safe keeping, while the world broke around them. 
.
The death of Lews Therin Telamon came early in the Breaking. In his 
death throes he called down a mighty blast of power to smite himself 
where he stood on an endless rolling field of grassland. A great black 
mountain was created where he struck, the ground heaving it into 
existence, a mountain that would cast a shadow across a river and over 
an island that would be where the Aes Sedai began again. This mountain 
would be called Dragonmount, the place of the Dragon&apos;s rebirth, while 
the island would be named Tar Valon, the tower that guards, awaiting 
his coming. 
.
In the years that followed the White Tower of Tar Valon was formed, 
built by Elisane Tishar, first Amyrlin Seat. The influence of the Aes 
Sedai grew until few nations rulers were without Aes Sedai advisors, 
greatly due to the fact that all Aes Sedai now swore three oaths - to 
speak no word that is not true, to make no weapon for one man to kill 
another, and to use the One Power as a weapon against only Shadowspawn,
or in the last defense of her life, the life of her Warder, or that of 
another Aes Sedai. These oaths were binding, and one who had sworn 
could NOT break them. 
.
The purpose of the Aes Sedai now is much the same as it was in the past
- as a Servant of All. They are healers and guides, advisors kings and 
queens, keepers of lost knowledge, and each Ajah within the Tower has 
its own specific purpose.

&amp;gNovice Rules, Behavior and Etiquette&amp;n
.
Novices should curtsey to all Aes Sedai and Accepted, and be respectful
at all times. This includes never interrupting when an Aes Sedai or 
Accepted is speaking, never turning away if they are being spoken to, 
and answering all questions straight away and truthfully. They can 
leave only when dismissed. 
.
Novices should use common sense and discretion when dealing with males 
of any rank. Chatting about the weather in a public place is perfectly 
acceptable. Canoodling in a private corner of the garden is not. 
.
A novice must never grasp Saidar without permission or supervision by 
an Aes Sedai or Accepted. 
.
Novices must never leave the the village without permission.
.
There are other things that a novice will learn through time about both 
her attitude and behavior. Before being raised to Accepted, Novices 
should know about composure, for example not looking at the ground 
constantly, acting with a little grace and decorum, having good table 
manners and neatness of appearance.

&amp;gNOVICE WEAVES&amp;n

The purpose of this document is to list some simple weaves or uses for 
the One Power that would be likely taught to Novices so that the guild 
can have standard examples of how these should be done. The list is not
all inclusive. That would likely not be possible. It is a rough 
guideline of the things a Novice should learn before being raised to 
Accepted.

.
&amp;CHarden Air:&amp;n Flows of Air used to form a hard surface. This can be used 
for various things. Flows of air tightly woven into a hard disc can 
form a shield to deflect blows. The same type of barrier can be 
expanded out to form a wall. Offensively, hardened air can be formed 
into a club for use as a weapon. [Note: see the three oaths] It can 
also be formed into a switch or whip-like construct. 
.
&amp;cJane channels flows of Air into a tightly spun disc. There is a slight 
shimmering in front of her as the air hardens just in time to deflect 
the incoming stone. &amp;n
.
&amp;CBind:&amp;n Bands of air can be used to immobilize a target or to hold 
objects in place. Combined with hardened air, it can be used to gag, 
blindfold or stop the ears of a target. 
.
&amp;cJane channels out thick bands of Air, attempting to loop them around 
Joe and pin his arms to his sides. &amp;n
.
&amp;CLift:&amp;n This is the most common use for Air. It is similar to bind, 
except that once the target is &quot;grabbed&quot; it is then lifted. Weight 
directly affects difficulty. The heavier the target and the higher it 
is lifted, the more power is required. Lifting a person is difficult, 
although it is doable, especially by someone who is strong enough to 
gate. However, lifting them more than a couple of yards would be a 
herculean task unless the person is small or the channeler is of 
Forsaken caliber strength. 
.
&amp;cJane wraps flows of Air tightly around the kettle. Slowly and 
carefully, she lifts it from the table, the glow of Saidar around her 
increasing in intensity as she begins to draw more deeply on the One 
Power. &amp;n
.
&amp;RHeat:&amp;n Thin flows of Fire are woven into an object to heat it. Excellent
for heating water for tea. 
.
&amp;cJane channels thin threads of Fire, passing them through the kettle 
slowly and carefully until a thin stream of steam begins to rise from 
the spout. &amp;n
.
&amp;RFlame:&amp;n A single thread of Fire is looped or twisted at the end to 
concentrate it and produce a visible flame. 
.
&amp;cJane holds her hands cupped in front of her and channels a slender 
thread of Fire into the hollow formed by her fingers. She forms the 
thread into a loop and gradually increases the intensity of the flow 
until a small flame appears and flickers above her palms. &amp;n
.

&amp;RIgnite:&amp;n A single flow of Fire is inserted into the target, causing it 
to burst into flames. 
.
&amp;cJane adjusts her shawl more snugly about her shoulders and then focuses 
her attention on the fireplace. The glow of Saidar slowly envelopes her 
as she embraces the True Source. She spins out a thin thread of Fire 
into the heart of the largest piece of firewood. The thread thickens as 
she pours more strength into it until, after a moment, the log bursts 
into flames. &amp;n
.
&amp;RWarm Room:&amp;n This is a complex web of fine threads of Fire used to warm 
the air. This weave should not be tied off and left unattended, lest it 
get out of hand and start a fire. 
.
&amp;cJane&apos;s breath is visible in the chill air of her bedchamber as she 
concentrates on spinning out the fine tendrils of Fire until they reach 
all corners of the room. After just a few moments, the room is toasty 
warm. She releases the weave and finally slips out from beneath her 
heavy, down-filled comforter.&amp;n 
.
&amp;yShape Stone:&amp;n Flows of Earth can be used to rearrange the composition of 
dirt, metal or stone in order to reshape it. Basically, it is sculpting 
using just the One Power. Size of the task affects the difficulty. 
Bending a sword blade would probably not be very hard, especially if 
you just make the metal soft and malleable in one small spot and then 
use flows of air for the actual bending. Rearranging a large boulder 
into a statue would be a good deal more difficult, and the One Power in 
no way guarantees artistic ability. 
.
&amp;cJane studies the marble plaque, a frown of concentration marring her 
Aes Sedai serenity. She carefully weaves light flows of Earth into the 
stone, gradually smoothing away the inscription. In mere moments, Joe&apos;s 
engraved protestations of undying love are no more.&amp;n 
.
&amp;yDelve Ores:&amp;n Probing flows of earth are used to find and identify ores 
in the ground. The ability is very rare in women. 
.
&amp;cAfter several moments of carefully probing the closed box&apos;s contents 
with threads of Earth, Jane looks up and announces,&apos;It contains a piece 
of coal, a copper farthing and a silver mark.&apos; &amp;n

&amp;BDry:&amp;n Flows of water can be used to move moisture out of hair, clothing, 
etc. This is probably the most common use to which simple weaves of 
Water are put in the books. 
.
&amp;cJane weaves threads of Water carefully through Joe&apos;s drenched clothing, 
drawing the moisture out and causing it to gather in a pool at his feet 
leaving his fancy, silk coat dry, but ruined. &amp;n
.
&amp;BMove Water:&amp;n Flows of Water can be used to move liquid around. This is 
useful for gathering up a spill or stirring. 
.
&amp;cJane channels flows of Water into the puddle, causing it to gather up 
into a quivering ball about the size of her head. Gently, she lifts it 
with a cradling web of Air and slowly moves it to the window where she 
releases it, allowing it to splash onto the ground below.&amp;n 
.
&amp;BCreate Water:&amp;n Flows of water can be used to coax moisture from the air. 
The difficulty would be determined by how humid the air is and how much 
water one is attempting to create. This would not be terribly easy, 
even under ideal circumstances. 
.
&amp;cJane concentrates and forms a web made of tendrils of Water, radiating 
to all corners of the room, but centered over her small tea cup. She 
uses the weave to gradually coax moisture from the air of the room, 
along the weave to the cup. After a few moments, droplets of water 
begin to fall from the center of the web into the cup, slowly filling 
it. &amp;n
.
&amp;YBall of Light:&amp;n Air is used to form the hollow shell or ball. A fine 
thread of Fire is then looped inside the shell to produce the light. 
.
&amp;cJane holds her hands in front of her about a foot apart with the palms 
facing each other. She spins out a thread of Air and weaves it into a 
mesh-like ball in the middle of the space between her hands. Carefully, 
she inserts a thin filament of Fire into the hollow sphere and loops 
it, pulsing energy along the thread causing the entire construct to 
glow with a soft light. &amp;n

&amp;gTHEORIES OF FLOW INTERACTION&amp;n
.
The purpose of this presentation is to supply the student with a 
knowledge of how the different flows react with each other so that the 
channeler may more easily determine which flows to use in each weave. 
Since Robert Jordan was not consulted in this matter, it is all just 
opinion and speculation. Hopefully, it will be usefull to our guild.
.
Each of the five flows has attributes which determine how it reacts 
with the other flows. Aptitude with Fire and Earth is more common in 
men, so we will refer to these flows as masculine. In general, the use 
of Water and Air come more easily to women. We will label these as 
feminine. Fire and Air are more energetic flows, so will be referred to 
as active. Water and Earth embody the passive principle. Spirit is not 
masculine or feminine. It also seems to function in an active or 
passive role, depending on what is needed. 
.
&amp;RFIRE&amp;n      masculine/active
.
Fire is used to control heat energy, adding or removing it from a
weave. Care should be taken when using Fire to remove heat, as drawing
the energy into one&apos;s self is dangerous and very often fatal. It reacts
with other flows as follows:
Air -- These two flows tend to compliment and strengthen each other. 
Adding the two actives tends to make them even more active. The 
male/female aspects support each other. To burn strongly, a fire needs
air.
.

Earth -- The tension and conflict caused by both being male, but one 
active and one passive, can cause explosive reactions if twined 
closely.
.
Water -- These two flows are diametrically opposite. Combining them
can result in violent, energetic reactions.
Spirit -- Combination with spirit can produce various effects.
.
.
&amp;CAIR&amp;n        feminine/active
.
Controls wind movements and can be used to manipulate objects as if an
extra appendage. Where fire is heat energy, Air is kinetic energy.
Interactions:
.
Fire -- Already dealt with under the fire discussion.
.
Earth -- These are complete opposites, like fire and water. They react
vigorously, although not as violently as would fire and water because
the active principle in this reaction is feminine.
.
Water -- Both are feminine, which can cause conflict. However, they can
also support one another. The passive nature of water can provide a 
foundation for strengthening the actions of the air element.
.
Spirit -- As always, combination with spirit can produce different 
results depending on how it is used.
.
.
&amp;yEARTH&amp;n      masculine/passive
.
Earth is used for manipulating solids. It is passive, forming a
foundation for other flows to build upon or react with. It controls
cohesion, being used to reinforce and strengthen or to weaken and
crumble.
.
Fire -- Dealt with in the fire discussion.
.
Air -- Dealt with in the air discussion.
.
Water -- These flows are complimentary, much as Fire and Air are. One
is masculine and the other feminine, causing them to mesh well, while
they are both passive which causes no conflicts. 
.
Spirit -- Various results.
.
.
&amp;BWATER&amp;n      feminine/passive
.
Much like earth, water controls cohesion, providing support or 
undermining the structure of a weave. Because of the feminine nature, it is more likely to provide support than to be used destructively. It 
is also used to manipulate liquids.
.
The way water reacts with the other flows has already been addressed in
the sections for those various flows, with the exception of Spirit, 
which reacts in various different ways depending on how it is used and
what is needed.
.
.
&amp;WSPIRIT&amp;n
.
Spirit is neither masculine nor feminine. It can act passively or 
actively or even neutrally. It can act as a catalyst to increase the
effects of other flows, or it can dampen them. Its realm is life energy
and things dealing with the one power itself.
