    <desc>No description yet.  The guardians against the Blight, the Borderguard is
in fact made of the four northernmost countries in the land : Saldaea,
Kandor, Arafel and Shienar.  Unlike the southern nations, the constant
struggle against the Blight has forced them to cooperate in a cofortable
manner if they are to successfully carry out the task they have been bound
to for thousands of years.  Indeed, many nations stood where they now do
(such as the doomed Malkier, Elsalam, Rhamdashar and many others),
fighting against the looming Shadow.  Many of these nations have been
broken, with their people dying and lands disapearing.  But the
bordlanders have come to accept death as a part of their life, and
continue to fight, forgetting all other troubles to beat the odds and
prevent this fate from coming to the rest of the world.

  <ghelp keyword="Nation_Militaries">
    <entry>Here are some short and basic descriptions of the different borderland militaries.
These should help you in forming a description, as well as fill in some RP elements.

&amp;r-Saldaea-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Maradon
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n Three silver fish on a field of dark blue
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Three Silver Fish, The Silver Fish
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n Queen Tenobia Si Bashere Kazadi
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n (typical light cavalry)Usually unarmored. Baggy breeches, short coats,
lances, seprentine blades.

A stubborn breed, they are also very forward in dealing with people. The great
portion of their strength lies in their expertise in riding horses.

&amp;r-Shienar-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Fal Moran
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n A black swooping hawk  on a field of three blue and two white horizontal stripes
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Black Hawk
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n King Easar Togita
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n (heavy lancers and cavalry) Long lances tipped with 2 feet of steel.
Mounts of heavy lancers are armored. One or two longswords strapped to back.
Some sort of practical melee weapon strapped to waist (i.e. mace, axe, short sword, broadsword). 
Armor consists of a heavy assortment of leather/mail/plate combinations. This is normally
covered with a surcoat bearing the Shienaran Sigil upon it. The hair of the normal 
soldier is kept closely shaved, and the top kept in a topknot.

Shienarans lives rest in thier honor (like the majority of borderlanders), even if they
must die for it. They are intensely respectful and loyal, especially torwards women.

&amp;r-Kandor-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Chachin
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n The Red Horse on a field of pale green
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Red Horse
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n Queen Ethenielle
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n Dressed out usually in red, for the Red Horse. Bodies are covered 
in steel plate (normally only front and back of the torso), the Sigil emblazoned on 
the front. The helmets are occasionally crested with sigil of the personal lord they are 
bound to. Most officers wear steel gauntlets. Most soldiers carry their 
longswords at the hip.

Not only are the Kandori a battle hardened breed, unlike the rest of the
borderlands, they have established a strong economy based on guild systems.
The success of a person is usually judged by the quality of the 
earing they wear, as long as the number of chains across the chest. While the hair 
 is kept short, they grow long beards, usually forked.

&amp;r-Arafel-&amp;n
&amp;CCapitol :&amp;n Shol Arbela
&amp;CBanner :&amp;n Three white roses on a field of red quartered with three red roses on a field of white
&amp;CSigil :&amp;n The Roses
&amp;CCurrent Ruler :&amp;n King Paitar Nachiman
&amp;CCostume :&amp;n The type of armor they wear can vary. The Arafellen are skilled swordsmen, 
often wearing two swords, the hilts protruding from both shoulders.

As strong as the rest of the borderlanders, and just as bound to honor. Both
men and women will put their hair into two braids, silver bells on the end of them.
