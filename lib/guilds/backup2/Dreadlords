    <desc>Dreadlords: Those men and women who, able to channel the One Power, went
over to the Shadow during the Trolloc Wars and more recently, acting as
commanders over the Trolloc Forces. They have been occasionally confused
with the Forsaken by the less well educated. They act as Generals over
armies of Trollocs, Myrddraal, and Darkfriends.

Dreadlords are a very secretive group for obvious reasons, and thus details
cannot be disclosed at this time. What can be said, is that they are 
involved in various military and political operations. If you can channel
and you enjoy intrigue, plotting, and hatching schemes, Dreadlords might 
be for you.
</desc>
    <reqs>Joining Dreadlords is no easy undertaking. It might require weeks of seeking
and plenty of hard work and determination. Only the best of the best are 
chosen. Many will seek and few will join.

Firstly, there are several ground rules you should check over before going
any further:

1. Your character must be able to channel (male or female).

2. No character who has ever been a full Aes Sedai (Tower or Rebel) may join.

3. Nobody who is currently guilded to either Aes Sedai group may seek.

4. If you are guilded to the Black Tower (Asha&apos;man), you may not seek.

5. No Wolfkin or Ogier allowed.

6. You &amp;rmust&amp;n be level 20, just like any other guild.

Again, please let me stress the difficulty of joining this elite group and
the rigorous standards involved.

There are &amp;gthree&amp;n stages to the Dreadlord seeking process:

&amp;mPrimary Stage:&amp;n

This is where you send your background and description to the Guildleader
via mudmail. The GL for Dreadlords is &amp;KShai&apos;tan&amp;n. After mudmailing the
GL, type &quot;&amp;rseekguild dreadlords&amp;n&quot; or &quot;&amp;rseekguild 22&amp;n&quot; to use the code to
&quot;flag&quot; yourself as a seeker.

Background: A simple and concise history of your character prior to joining
DLs. It should be be noted that plain backgrounds are easier to join with,
rather than extensive ones listing numerous talents and abilities. It is
easier to develop a character from a solid foundation, rather than a base
with lots of frilly lace than cannot hold water.

An example of something to stay away from:

&amp;BClayton&apos;s father was a &amp;WBlademaster&amp;B and taught him everything he knew,
and gave him his heron-marked sword the day he died.&amp;n

Description: The text another player sees when he/she types &quot;&amp;rlook &lt;your name.&amp;n&quot;
or &quot;&amp;rglance &lt;your name&gt;&amp;n&quot;. It should have information concerning your
character&apos;s physical appearance containing such things as: eye and hair
colour, type of clothing, and so on. Things you want to stay away from are
physical actions and forcing people to &quot;feel&quot; a certain way when they look
at you.

For example:

&amp;BClayton notices you looking at him and suddenly unsheathes his sword and&amp;n
&amp;Bbegins polishing it with a dangerous glint in his eye.&amp;n

or

&amp;BAs you look at Clayton, you feel a twinge in your belly which quicky grows&amp;n
&amp;Bin to mortal terror.&amp;n

The above examples are things we do not want to see.

&amp;mSecondary Stage:&amp;n
After being authorized to seek by &amp;KShai&apos;tan&amp;n, it will be the seeker&apos;s 
responsibility to gather &amp;gsponsors&amp;n. As it stands now, seekers only 
require &amp;r-1-&amp;n sponsor. Sponsors must posess the rank of &amp;BHigh &amp;KDreadlord&amp;n
or better. &amp;rChosen&amp;n may also sponsor seekers. The best way to convince
a sponsor you would be a perfect DL, would be to RP with them.

(Please &amp;rnote&amp;n: If you are having trouble finding sponsors, you can
&amp;g-politely-&amp;n ask &amp;KShai&apos;tan&amp;n for a list.)

&amp;mThird Stage:&amp;n

Once you have your 1 sponsorship, a gathering of all HDLs and above with the
GL will be held. A vote will be taken amoung the Mortals present, with the
Guildleader acting as &quot;Chairperson&quot;, and will vote if there is a tie. The
GL can also overthrown any decisions made by the &amp;KDreadlord Council&amp;n.

&amp;mEpilogue:&amp;n

If you have been accepted, you will be guilded and the real fun will begin.

If you have been turned down, you may try again for a maximum total of
&amp;r-3-&amp;n attempts per character.
