    <desc>&amp;GThe Eyes and Ears of the Dragonsworn:&amp;n

A small group of Dragonsworn with slightly different beliefs on how
to best serve The Prophet and The Lord Dragon Reborn.  Instead
of running around and fanatically preaching about The Lord Dragon
being reborn, or trying to kneel people to swear the Oaths of the
Dragonsworn, they use more subtle means.  In fact, they openly
dissassociate from the rest of the Dragonsworn, though they do
keep in contact, but just never in public.  Rather than rant at people,
they listen, they blend in, they gather information and bring it back
to their superiors.  Sometimes, though rarely, they undertake counter
action against enemies to The Prophet and The Lord Dragon.

This inner group of Dragonsworn is also made up of various informants
from all over, people who profit from the sale of information or persons
with secret loyalties to The Prophet or The Lord Dragon Reborn.
</desc>
    <reqs>Requirements for guilded Dragonsworn:

You must have a subtle nature, be able to hide your allegiance to
The Lord Dragon Reborn, and be able to control your true emotions
and opinions.  See Ryokui for more on the requirements.

Requirements for non-Dragonsworn:

An in character loyalty to either The Prophet or The Lord Dragon
Reborn.  Or perhaps, a person looking to manipulate The Prophet
and his followers for his or her own interests and gains.
Furthermore, you could outright be looking to spread disinformation
to The Dragonsworn or The Prophet.

***OOC note:

The memebers of this guild consider it completely IC and therefore
rp accordingly.  Anyone who is interested in being an informer for
whatever reason, despite the IC conflicts it may present, ICly the guild
is very discreet about it&apos;s sources.  Not only that, but OOC discreetness
is also something entirely reasonable.  And as far as the disinformation
bit, it goes without saying that there&apos;s a lot of information
floating around out there, with and without merit, deceptive and
noteworthy.  The offer stands merely as a way to be more realistic
and of course, to provide for interesting rp.

  <ghelp keyword="GSKILLS:">
    <entry>&amp;GE+EotDS Gskills:&amp;n

&amp;BTail:&amp;n

Usage: tail &lt;player/mob name&gt;, this allows you to follow a
player without them seeing the message &apos;Mr.X starts to follow you.&apos;
(this is also a DS Gskill as well)

&amp;BDisguise:&amp;n

Usage: disguise &lt;new name/alias&gt;, this skill allows you to take
on an entirely new persona by changing your name, allowing you to
create a temporary player desc (type desc to get the description
buffer).  When you create a new player desc, it&apos;s temporary in the
sense that once you turn the disguise off (type disguise off), your
original desc &quot;snaps back&quot; so to speak.  Upon disguising, you&apos;ll get
the message, &quot;You&apos;re now disguised as &lt;name&gt;!  Don&apos;t forget to give
yourself a nice title and a description now!&quot; &lt;-- this is good to remember
as your title will -not- change upon disguising, and thus could give you
away OOCly.  Recommended, set up a trigger so that when you receive
this message, you automatically wipe your title.  If you&apos;re using zMUD
it&apos;s fairly simple to do. (Ask Ryo more about this if need be)

&amp;GNote:&amp;n  Disguise is not given out frequently and will be done so on
a case by case basis and through roleplay.  These are technically both
still DS Gskills, so, realistically, it&apos;s uncertain whether they can be given
out to anyone who&apos;s not DS.  Policy on that is pending (hence the case by
case basis on handing them out).

  <ghelp keyword="Ranks:">
    <entry>&amp;GE+EotDS Ranks/Subranks:&amp;n

Scout-
Entrance rank, duties entail some light reconnaisance, mostly
just keeping one&apos;s eyes and ears open and reporting regularily
to the Spymaster or perhaps a guildie assigned to teaching or
watching over the Scout.

Scout [&amp;yTracker&amp;n]-
One step up from &apos;Scout&apos;, this is a slightly more specialized rank
in the sense that, one with it will focus mostly on tracking either
suspect people, or those otherwise of interest to the Spymaster.
Note that tracking does not entail engaging whoever is being
sought after, merely locating them, and reporting back.  It&apos;s some-
one else&apos;s job to actually act on any information gathered by a
Tracker.

Scout [&amp;wRanger&amp;n]-
A more knowledgable scout on the whole, able to track through
any setting, whether it be wilderness or urban.  Also skilled in
hiding tracks, deciphering different tracks, uncovering hidden
tracks and spotting false trails.  A Ranger can generally adapt
him/herself in any setting and thus has talents in stealth and
most often disguise as well, not to mention tailing.

Field Agent-
This rank signifies that not only does the person hold all of the
skills and talents mentioned above, but is also knowledgable and
adaptive in the sense that, they are prepared to take on roles
within groups other than the Dragonsworn.  For instance, Field
Agents will potentially join up with groups such as The Band of
the Red Hand for reconnaisance purposes.  Keeping a dual
alligiance, the stronger alligiance of course remaining with the
Dragonsworn (E+EotDS).

Field Officer-
Ranking individual in charge in the field, this rank is for
guildies who would act as a go-between for Field Agents
and the Spymaster.  For this reason, Field Officers in general
do not become too involved with groups outside of the
Dragonsworn, although they can and are qualified to do so.

Operative [&amp;bUndercover&amp;n]-
This rank speaks for itself really.  A member of the E+EotDS
who is temporarily rooted within another guild or group of some
sort.  Where a Field Agent is potentially involved with outside
groups, an Operative&apos;s -purpose- is to take an active role in
such a group, using their standing to gain information for the
Spymaster and keep him regularily informed, if not directly.

Operative [&amp;rInfiltrator&amp;n]-
A slight variation on the &apos;Undercover&apos; subrank, this rank entails
a more deeply rooted and longterm role within a guild outside
the Dragonsworn.  Again, entering a guild to gather information
and/or spread disinformation.  Being an Operative of any sort
requires established skill in disguise.  Not only appearance altering
but also speech pattern variations and knowledge in clothing styles
and regional customs.

Top Agent [&amp;mDeep Cover&amp;n]-
Depending on the job an Operative undertakes, whether he/she
wants to or not, they could move up to this rank.  Meaning that
their situation could very well become such as that it would be more
dangerous to remove them from their post, than to leave them be
and almost entirely cut off contact with the Spymaster or any other
members of the E+EotDS.  Basically a guildie with this rank has been
left to his/her own devices within whatever guild or job they&apos;ve taken
on.

Top Agent [&amp;KDouble-Agent&amp;n]-
Again, an Operative may move up to this, or perhaps someone in
deep cover may.  Whether or not the original intention was to gain
such a rank (as per a plan devised by the Spymaster or an Advisor)
would be unknown.  A Top Agent in this position would begin as spy
for the Dragonsworn, but, eventually, either through opportunity
or through manipulation, they become a &quot;spy&quot; for whatever group
or guild they&apos;ve infiltrated.  Of course, their loyalty would remain for
the Dragonsworn, although there&apos;s always risks involved with this
rank.

  <ghelp keyword="Ranks(cont.):">
    <entry>&amp;GE+EotDS Ranks/Subranks (cont.):&amp;n

Officer [&amp;gUnder-Advisor&amp;n]-
Essentially a glorified clerk, no field work, merely a relay for the
Advisor and the Spymaster.  Gathers reports, issues reports,
keeps the records organized and subsequently secret.  Not only
does the rank entail legal work, but also involves offering informed
opinions and input to the Advisor and Spymaster.

Lieutenant Commander [&amp;cAdvisor&amp;n]-
Second in command, answers only to the Spymaster himself and
is qualified to act on his behalf enitirely should the need arise.

Spymaster [&amp;WCommander&amp;n]-
The head man of the Eyes and the Ears of the Dragonsworn.
Just as the Lieutenant Commander does, the Spymaster retains
-all- of the skills and abilities aforementioned and has honed them
to an art form.  Not only a leader and strategist, but a virtual
chameleon or it could even be said, &quot;A man of a thousand faces&quot;.

Snitch-
A common information seller, reliability varying greatly, loyalty little
to none.  (Except to coin)

Informer-
Loyal in the sense that Informers are somewhat partnered with
their contacts, and thus build a living on being trusted by the people
they do business with (at least outwardly).  Informers are more
of an information trader, giving and getting, so it&apos;s typically good
form for such a person to not spread disinformation to &quot;clients&quot;.

Sympathizer-
Someone who secretly has a loose alligiance to the Dragonsworn
or whomever they offer information.  Sympathizers could offer infor-
mation based on whether or not they like an agent personally, or
believe him/her to be an honorable man.  In otherwords, they don&apos;t
try and gain anything from imparting information, it&apos;s something
they -want- to do, or may even feel obligated to do, even if they&apos;re
not openly associated with the Dragonsworn in any way (which isn&apos;t
to say they&apos;d not like to be, although they may be unable).

&amp;GSubrank Clarifications:&amp;n

Certain guildies may hold subranks with tags like [&amp;RB&amp;rot&amp;RRH&amp;n]
or something similiar, this indicates which group/guild they are
actively taking a role in for reconnaisance purposes.

Also, certain subranks may begin [&amp;kAlias: &amp;K&lt;name&gt;&amp;n], this
indicates the alias the guildie goes by and who we know him/her as
within the Eyes and the Ears of the Dragonsworn.
